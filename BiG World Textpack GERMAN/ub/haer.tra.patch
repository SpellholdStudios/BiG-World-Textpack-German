-@76   = ~Think well and hard, my raven. Your time will soon run out.~
-@77   = ~Talk to whomever 'witnessed' me at the night of the murder, my raven. 'Twas one of Balthis' men, no doubt, and he will be found at the estate in the Bridge District.~
-@78   = ~Inspector Brega himself may yield more answers. But unless you hurry, this sparrow will never fly again. Hurry, my daring rescuer, or you may not find me within these dismal walls ere you return.~
-@79   = ~Bring your news not to me, my raven, but to the Chief Inspector. 'Tis him who holds this sparrow's life in his hands.~

-@85   = ~I have changed my mind. I will help you, Haer'Dalis.~
-@86   = ~I must go.~
-@87   = ~I think you are the murderer, and I'll let the law deal with you.~
-@88   = ~No, my raven. Chaos and enthropy rule over this sparrow's destiny, but even a Doomguard knows when he is beaten. Without the Chief Inspector's verdict of innocence, even a dozen corpses at my feet would mean little.~
-@89   = ~What know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves? Yet this sparrow holds no demands, my raven. Aid him or not, as it pleases you.~
-@90   = ~'Tis strange to hear from the lips that hastened to accuse me only moments before, but this sparrow is glad of any help. Hasten to the late Lord Balthis' estate, my raven. Fly well, and leave angry words behind.~
-@91   = ~Fly, then.~
-@92   = ~That wretch! Truly, he has no notion of beauty or artistic elegance.~
-@93   = ~Indeed? Well, whoever told him led the good inspector astray.~
-@94   = ~But he's onto something. The real culprit would want someone to take the blame... and would likely be aware of this sparrow's interest.~
-@95   = ~And the only people who would even know that I asked about the statue would be Acton's servants... and, of course, that fat man with whom I discussed the statue outside.~
-@96   = ~'That fat man outside?'~
-@97   = ~Go on.~
-@98   = ~Oh, yes, didn't I mention that?~
-@99   = ~I do not know who the man was, but we marvelled at the wonderful artwork together. He was a collector, obviously.~
-@100  = ~That is all I can tell you, my raven. I beg of you, fly swiftly, for this sparrow's time draws near.~
-@101  = ~At long last, my raven! I owe you more than I can ever repay.~
-@102  = ~True hope is swift, and flies with sparrow's wings;
-Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.~
-@103  = ~Well said, my friend. Freedom is yours now.~
-@104  = ~You've done well, <CHARNAME>. I am proud of you.~
-@105  = ~Minsc and Boo and Haer'Dalis and friends! Hamsters, rangers and blue-haired bards, rejoice!~
-@106  = ~I'm... very happy f-for you, Haer'Dalis.~
-@107  = ~Thank you, my friends. But of the true originator, the culprit, you know nothing still?~
-@108  = ~No. Only that it was an illusionist who looked like you.~
-@109  = ~Do you know who it was?~
-@110  = ~I have a thought, an idea both brilliant and plain. If you wish to deal with the mysterious assassin, I can put out the rumor through my sources that evidence was left behind at the estate, putting question to the idea I was the actual murderer.~
-@111  = ~If we do so, I suspect our assassin will show up at his first opportunity.~
-@112  = ~You have sources, Haer'Dalis?~
-@113  = ~It can work.~
-@114  = ~He's likely already far away.~
-@115  = ~The life of an actor is full of strange turns, my raven. And makes strange bedfellows.~
-@116  = ~Aye, and the rumor will make him return.~
-@117  = ~Now, shall we travel together once more? This world's wonders are ours to behold.~
-@118  = ~Enter Haer'Dalis.~
-@119  = ~Not his time. Wait for me at the Five Flagons.~
-@120  = ~So shall it be.~
-@121  = ~This is it, my brave ravens. To Inspector Brega we fly!~
-@122  = ~I am sorry, the estate is closed. We are in mourning, so whatever you're here for can wait, I'm sure.~
-@123  = ~Actually, my friend Haer'Dalis is about to be executed.~
-@124  = ~I've been told someone witnessed the murder.~
-@125  = ~That murderer is your friend? A pity you weren't arrested together.~
-@126  = ~I've told everything to Inspector Brega. Talk to him, if you insist on knowing the details of this distressing event. I have nothing to say to the likes of you.~
-@127  = ~Please, Haer'Dalis is innocent!~
-@128  = ~You will talk, unless you want to dangle upside down from the roof beam!~
-@129  = ~Don't you want everyone to know the truth?~
-@130  = ~Did he tell you that?~
-@131  = ~T-there's no need for threats!~
-@132  = ~And by 'everyone' you mean you, I presume? Typical. But very well, you've made your point.~
-@133  = ~I saw the murderer, plain as day. I was already half-asleep, but heard a struggle in Lord Balthis' room and entered, only to find that thief standing over the corpse with his blades.~
-@134  = ~Next minute he jumped out the window to escape. Well, naturally he wasn't going to stay for the guards!~
-@135  = ~Inspector Brega mentioned the robbery. Tell me more.~
-@136  = ~You called him 'the thief', not 'the murderer'. Why?~
-@137  = ~Did that thief steal anything?~
-@138  = ~Lord Balthis' invaluable bust of Sune is missing! That's how I remembered the thief: he had come asking about it only days before.~
-@139  = ~That would be a rather obvious thing for a thief to do, wouldn't it?~
-@140  = ~What if Haer'Dalis and the man you saw were two different people?~
-@141  = ~You could've been mistaken in the poor light, though. What if it wasn't Haer'Dalis?~
-@142  = ~I hadn't thought of that before... but I saw what I saw.~
-@143  = ~Has anyone else ever asked about that bust?~
-@144  = ~Can you tell me anything else at all?~
-@145  = ~Not really... But Quataris, an art dealer and collector from the Promenade, was quite jealous that Lord Balthis outbid him to acquire the bust. That is all I can say. I suggest you leave the estate now.~
-@146  = ~The estate is closed. Please, leave now.~
-@147  = ~I am here to ask you some questions about Acton Balthis' murder.~
-@148  = ~What about the bust of Sune? I've heard you were very interested in it.~
-@149  = ~Never mind.~
-@150  = ~Of course.~
-@151  = ~I am glad that the fiendish thief was brought to justice. Acton Balthis was a fine man and a great loss to the art community. Beyond that, I've little to say.~
-@152  = ~I see. Thank you for your time.~
-@153  = ~That is all for now.~
-@154  = ~I've already been asked all about that by Inspector Brega. There's no need for me to answer your questions! Moreover, I have nothing to do with that... piece of art!~
-@155  = ~(bluff) Really? My friend Haer'Dalis saw you under Lord Balthis' window.~
-@156  = ~Really? My friend Haer'Dalis saw you under Lord Balthis' window.~
-@157  = ~Inspector Brega says otherwise.~
-@158  = ~Pip at Lord Balthis' estate mentioned the opposite.~
-@159  = ~That's enough! I won't stand here and take this! Guards!~
-@160  = ~Guards! GUARDS!! Protect me!!~
-@161  = ~Please, please don't kill me.~
-@162  = ~Did you hire the murderer?~
-@163  = ~Confess, and I may spare your life.~
-@164  = ~Please, just let me speak! I will tell you everything you need to know.~
-@165  = ~Who needs this worthless confession! This man trades in rare scrolls, forgotten relics, Netheril artifacts! Seize them instead, you stupid monkey! (I can't believe I have to work with this).~
-@166  = ~Feh, he is cowering like a slithering worm. Just end his misery now, abbil.~
-@167  = ~Truly, a gross injustice has been committed. I admire you for bringing this coward to justice, my friend.~
-@168  = ~You'd b-better! Haer'Dalis nearly died because of you!~
-@169  = ~Yes, I wanted that bust of Sune. 'Twas a marvel to behold indeed, her marble so smooth, her face so vibrant...~
-@170  = ~I hired a local freelancer, Janos, to steal it. He is a master of illusions, so the... matter should have proceeded flawlessly. But something must have gone wrong...~
-@171  = ~Sign this confession and I'll let you go.~
-@172  = ~Now put all of this in writing.~
-@173  = ~Just... let me take a piece of parchment. If only my hands weren't shaking so much...~
-@174  = ~Here is my confession, and here is the bust of Sune, as well. Please do not kill me!~
-@175  = ~I won't. But you almost cost my friend his life.~
-@176  = ~The guards will come for you soon enough.~
-@177  = ~Too bad. Prepare to die!~
-@178  = ~I suppose they will throw me in your friend's cell now. Isn't that punishment enough?~
-@179  = ~No! Someone, helpl!!~
-@180  = ~I would like to know why my friend Haer'Dalis got arrested.~
-@181  = ~Here is the stolen bust of Sune and Quataris' written confession. I want Haer'Dalis freed.~
-@182  = ~Here is Quataris' written confession. I want Haer'Dalis freed.~
-@183  = ~Here is the stolen bust of Sune. Quataris the art dealer was behind it.~
-@184  = ~I killed the real thief, Janos. ~
-@185  = ~Your friend Haer'Dalis was witnessed killing Acton Balthis. I won't say by whom, but we have ascertained the witness isn't lying.~
-@186  = ~The intent of the murderer was originally robbery, and a valuable item, a bust of Sune, was taken from the estate. Haer'Dalis made certain admissions regarding it that made the connection obvious.~
-@187  = ~Pip, Lord Balthis' manservant, said as much. Have you recovered the bust?~
-@188  = ~I see. Where could this bust be now?~
-@189  = ~He admired a statue, and he's to be executed for that alone? Very clever.~
-@190  = ~Has this bust been found?~
-@191  = ~There were other clues, as I said. You are not doing your friend a service with this tone.~
-@192  = ~The bust of Sune hasn't been recovered, but Haer'Dalis would have likely sold it to one of two places: Quataris the art-dealer or the Shadow Thieves.~
-@193  = ~Really. The Shadow Thieves, you say. Who are obviously not guilty of anything.~
-@194  = ~Maybe this Quataris is involved in Lord Balthis' murder?~
-@195  = ~Who do you think the thief sold it to?~
-@196  = ~The Shadow Thieves would not dare steal from the Vice-Regent. As for Quataris, he says he has done nothing of the sort.~
-@197  = ~I cannot ascertain whether he is lying, for traders of his caliber are often protected by amulets and talismans against magical scrying.~
-@198  = ~Perhaps you should talk to Quataris yourself. His shop is set in the Promenade.~
-@199  = ~Or visit Lord Balthis' estate in the Bridge District, if you haven't been there already.~
-@200  = ~You have little time. The law is the law: your friend Haer'Dalis is due to be executed in three days, no ifs, ands or buts. If you wish to prove his innocence, you should make haste.~
-@201  = ~This is... quite remarkable. You've done a thorough job indeed.~
-@202  = ~While that's not exactly what I was looking for, it certainly sheds some doubt on the matter.~
-@203  = ~I thank you for your resourcefulness. Here is the writ of innocence for your friend. You will need this to free him from the city jail.~
-@204  = ~Go with my thanks and heartfelt apologies. And remember: should the real culprit be found, there will be a decent reward.~
-@205  = ~I have already been told by the Bridge District's guards. Again, you have my thanks and the thanks of the city.~
-@206  = ~What do you know of Lord Balthis' murder?~
-@207  = ~Not much. Chief Inspector Brega took over the witnesses. The culprit was a thief, as well, and stole something very valuable from the estate.~
-@208  = ~The Chief Inspector will probably tell you more. Or you could talk to Pip, Lord Acton's manservant.~
-@209  = ~You might be interested in helping out with Lord Balthis' murder, as well. Talk to his manservant, Pip, if you haven't already. I am sure Chief Inspector Brega will appreciate your assistance.~
-@210  = ~Good to hear that <CHARNAME> sorted out that nasty business with Lord Balthis' murder! We were mighty worried. Who would have thought they'd suspect you, aye?~
-@211  = ~Do you know anything about Lord Balthis' murder?~
-@212  = ~Not a thing. Word is, the Chief Inspector himself is questioning the witnesses, and he is holding his cards close. We are all worried about poor Haer'Dalis.~
-@213  = ~You seem to know better than I. Poor Haer'Dalis has been executed, and the real murderer is still on the loose. I've little else to say.~
-@214  = ~Heard from a cousin in the guards they've solved Lord Acton's murder. Grabbed some bard or other and put him behind the bars. Aye, good for 'em,
- I say.~
-@215  = ~I'm so glad they've arrested Lord Acton's killer! That bard always seemed a weird sort to me.~
-@216  = ~That bard was innocent, was he? I ain't believin' that. This foreign folk is always up t' somethin'.~
-@217  = ~That bard was released? Hmph. Well I never!~
-@218  = ~You! The one who's gotten the bard out of jail! You really shouldn't have done that!~
-@219  = ~I'd taken his face, and today I would take your life! Now the real fun begins!~
-@220  = ~And you have brought the bard with you. Too bad for you, I say!~

+@44   = ~Ich wünschte ich könnte gehen. Mystra, Llira, Waukeen, Sune, BITTE lasst ihn verstummen. Bitte. Bitte?~
+@45   = ~Auf keinen Fall. Meine Ohren werden wieder anfangen zu bluten. Außerdem ist es verboten, Dank Llira. Anordnung des Kommissars.~
+@46   = ~Wie wäre es mit hundert Goldstücken?~
+@47   = ~Wenn Ihr Haer'Dalis nicht mit mir reden lasst, wird er vollkommen unerträglich. Vertraut mir, ich weiß es.~
+@48   = ~Dann sollte ich vermutlich gehen.~
+@49   = ~Glaubt Ihr, daß es mir unter diesen Umständen auf Geld ankommt? Wartet, das tut es tatsächlich. Hundert Goldstücke? Her damit.~
+@50   = ~Ihr könnt vorbei, aber ich habe Euch nicht gesehen.~
+@51   = ~Was, noch schlimmer? Oh, Götter. Ihr dürft vorbei.~
+@52   = ~Ihr seid herumgeschlichen, nicht wahr? Ich habe Euch gesagt, daß Ihr nicht hierher dürft.~
+@53   = ~Kann ich mit dem Gefangenen sprechen?~
+@54   = ~Ja, ich werde nur... schnell vorbei schleichen.~
+@55   = ~Ich bin bloß vorbei gekommen.~
+@56   = ~Ach, geht vorbei. Ist mir egal. Ich glaube meine Ohren bluten...~
+@57   = ~Der Ausgang liegt in diese Richtung.~
+@58   = ~Eine weitere Stunde wie diese und ich quittiere den Dienst. Und zu den Neun Höllen mit dem Leutnant.~
+@59   = ~Ich sollte gehen.~
+@60   = ~Nun, ich soll verdammt sein. In Ordnung, das nehme ich. Ihr geht los und befreit ihn. Ich kann nicht glauben, daß ich endlich von diesem Geschwätz erlöst bin!~
+@61   = ~Meine rettenden Raben! Habt Ihr dieses Geheimnis schon enthüllt?~
+@62   = ~Noch nicht, Haer'Dalis. Es tut mir Leid.~
+@63   = ~Mir wurde mitgeteilt, daß Ihr kurz davor seid exekutiert zu werden.~
+@64   = ~Deshalb verzehre und übersättige ich mich Tag für Tag. Das wäre ein guter Witz, Leuten wie Herzog Darkwood zu entfliehen, nur um als einsame Elster am Galgen zu enden.~
+@65   = ~Gewiss, es ist rechtmäßig für diesen Barden, ebenso wie für jede andere unglückselige Seele in diesem Käfig. Nun ist meine Zeit gekommen, und Nichts als Eure Hand, mein teurer Rabe, kann dies abwenden.~
+@66   = ~Ich habe diesen Mann nie angerührt, aber ich war vor kurzer Zeit dort. Eines Nachts, als ich ruhelos war und umher lief, habe ich eine herrliche Büste im Fenster von Balthis Anwesen gesehen, die mich an meine geliebte Raelis erinnert hat, so perfekt und einzigartig, und ich war davon hingerissen.~
+@67   = ~Ich ging los, um mit den Leuten des Hauses zu sprechen und bat Acton Balthis persönlich darum die herrliche Büste näher betrachten zu dürfen und sie komplett bestaunen zu können... aber ich wurde ziemlich schnell hinaus geworfen.~
+@68   = ~Ich habe seitdem nicht mehr an diesen Vorfall gedacht, aber ich flehe Euch an, glaubt daß ich Lord Balthis nicht ermordet habe.~
+@69   = ~Wer war es dann?~
+@70   = ~Was kann ich tun um Euch zu befreien?~
+@71   = ~Warum töten wir nicht einfach die Wachen und fliehen?~
+@72   = ~Eure Wache ist tot. Kommt schon, lasst uns gehen!~
+@73   = ~Ich glaube Euch nicht. Ich denke ich lasse Euch hier.~
+@74   = ~Damit erreicht man nicht viel, dadurch wird dieser Spatz von jeder Wache in Athkatla und noch darüber hinaus gejagt. Nein, das ist keine Alternative die ich in Betracht ziehen möchte.~
+@75   = ~Und Ihr werdet für immer ungewiss sein. War Haer'Dalis schuldig? Hat er gelitten? Habe ich meinen Spatz für Nichts aufgegeben?~
+@76   = ~Denkt gründlich nach, mein Rabe. Die Zeit wird bald abgelaufen sein.~
+@77   = ~Sprecht mit wem auch immer, der mich in der Nacht des Mordes 'beobachtet' hat, mein Rabe. Es war einer von Balthis Männern, kein Zweifel, und er wird sich in dem Anwesen im Brückenbezirk befinden.~
+@78   = ~Vielleicht liefert Kommissar Brega selber mehr Antworten. Aber wenn Ihr Euch nicht eilt wird dieser Spatz nie wieder fliegen. Beeilt Euch, mein wagemutiger Retter, oder Ihr werdet mich bei Eurer Rückkehr vielleicht nicht mehr hinter diesen trostlosen Mauern finden.~
+@79   = ~Berichtet Eure Neuigkeiten nicht mir, mein Rabe, sondern dem Kommissar. Er ist es, der das Leben des Spatzes in seinen Händen hält.~
+@80   = ~Das werde ich, Haer'Dalis.~
+@81   = ~Ich habe keine neuen Beweise, tut mir Leid.~
+@82   = ~Pip, im Anwesen von Acton Balthis, beschuldigte Euch, weil er Euch mit der Büste von Sune gesehen hat.~
+@83   = ~Kommissar Brega sagte, daß Ihr Euch durch Euer Interesse an der Büste von Sune verdächtig gemacht habt.~
+@84   = ~Ich habe Eure Wache getötet. Ihr seid frei.~
+@85   = ~Ich habe meine Meinung geändert. Ich werde Euch helfen, Haer'Dalis.~
+@86   = ~Ich muss gehen.~
+@87   = ~Ich glaube Ihr seid der Mörder, und ich werde Euch dem Gesetz überlassen.~
+@88   = ~Nein, mein Rabe. Chaos und Entropie beherrschen das Schicksal dieses Spatzes, aber selbst eine Schicksalswache weiß wann sie geschlagen ist. Ohne den Freispruch des Kommissars würden selbst ein Dutzend Leichen zu meinen Füßen nur wenig bedeuten.~
+@89   = ~Was weiß das Gesetz davon, was Diebe auf andere Diebe abwälzen? Dennoch stellt dieser Spatz keine Forderungen, mein Rabe. Helft ihm oder nicht, wie es Euch gefällt.~
+@90   = ~Es ist befremdlich das von Lippen zu hören, die sich nur Momente zuvor eilten mich zu beschuldigen, aber dieser Spatz ist über jede Hilfe glücklich. Eilt zum Anwesen des kürzlich verstorbenen Lord Balthis, mein Rabe. Fliegt wohlauf, und lasst wütende Worte hinter Euch.~
+@91   = ~So fliegt denn.~
+@92   = ~Dieser Halunke! Wahrlich, er hat keine Ahnung von Schönheit oder künstlerischem Anmut.~
+@93   = ~Tatsächlich? Nun, wer dem guten Kommissar das gesagt hat, hat in die Irre geleitet.~
+@94   = ~Aber er hat eine Spur. Der wahre Übeltäter will jemanden, der für ihn den Kopf hin hält... und weiß über die Interessen des Spatzes Bescheid.~
+@95   = ~Und die einzigen Leute, die überhaupt wissen, daß ich nach der Büste gefragt habe, müssen die Diener von Acton sein... und natürlich dieser dicke Mann, mit dem ich draußen über die Büste diskutiert habe.~
+@96   = ~'Dieser dicke Mann draußen?'~
+@97   = ~Fahrt fort.~
+@98   = ~Oh, ja, habe ich das nicht erwähnt?~
+@99   = ~Ich weiß nicht wer dieser Mann war, aber wir haben zusammen das Kunstwerk bestaunt. Augenscheinlich war er ein Sammler.~
+@100  = ~Das ist alles was ich Euch sagen kann, mein Rabe. Ich flehe Euch an, fliegt geschwind, denn die Zeit dieses Spatzes nähert sich ihrem Ende.~
+@101  = ~Endlich, mein Rabe! Ich schulde Euch mehr als ich je zurück zahlen kann.~
+@102  = ~Wahre Hoffnung ist flüchtig, und fliegt mit den Schwingen eines Spatzen; doch auch aus Steinen, die einem in den Weg gelegt werden, kann man Schönes bauen.~
+@103  = ~Schön gesagt, mein Freund. Die Freiheit gehört jetzt Euch.~
+@104  = ~Das habt Ihr gut gemacht, <CHARNAME>. Ich bin stolz auf Euch.~
+@105  = ~Minsc und Boo und Haer'Dalis und die Freunde! Hamster, Krieger und Barden mit blauen Haaren, freut euch!~
+@106  = ~Ich... freue mich sehr für Euch, Haer'Dalis.~
+@107  = ~Ich danke Euch, meine Freunde. Aber vom wahren Urheber, dem Übeltäter, wisst Ihr immer noch nichts?~
+@108  = ~Nein. Nur daß er ein Illusionist ist und aussah wie Ihr.~
+@109  = ~Wisst Ihr wer es war?~
+@110  = ~Ich habe einen Gedanken, eine brillante und einfache Idee. Wenn Ihr mit dem geheimnisvollen Meuchelmörder abrechnen wollt, kann ich das Gerücht in die Welt streuen, daß Hinweise in dem Anwesen zurück gelassen wurden, die mich als Mörder in Frage stellen.~
+@111  = ~Wenn wir das machen, vermute ich, daß unser Meuchelmörder bei erster Gelegenheit erscheinen wird.~
+@112  = ~Habt Ihr mit so etwas Erfahrung, Haer'Dalis?~
+@113  = ~Es könnte funktionieren.~
+@114  = ~Er ist vermutlich schon weit weg.~
+@115  = ~Das Leben eines Darstellers ist voll von seltsamen Wendungen, mein Rabe. Und sorgt für seltsame Umstände.~
+@116  = ~Ja, und das Gerücht wird ihn dazu bringen zurück zu kommen.~
+@117  = ~Nun, sollen wir erneut zusammen reisen? Wir sollten die Wunder dieser Welt gemeinsam erblicken.~
+@118  = ~Schließt Euch an, Haer'Dalis.~
+@119  = ~Diesmal nicht. Wartet in den Fünf Krügen auf mich.~
+@120  = ~So soll es sein.~
+@121  = ~Das ist es, meine tapferen Raben. Wir werden zu Kommissar Brega fliegen!~
+@122  = ~Tut mir Leid, das Anwesen ist gesperrt. Wir sind in Trauer, warum auch immer Ihr hier seid kann also warten, da bin ich sicher.~
+@123  = ~Eigentlich steht mein Freund Haer'Dalis kurz davor exekutiert zu werden.~
+@124  = ~Mir wurde gesagt, daß jemand den Mörder beobachtet hat.~
+@125  = ~Dieser Mörder ist Euer Freund? Eine Schande, daß ihr nicht zusammen verhaftet worden seid.~
+@126  = ~Ich habe Kommissar Brega alles erzählt. Sprecht mit ihm, wenn Ihr darauf besteht die Details dieses erschütternden Vorfalls zu erfahren. Ich habe Leuten wie Euch nichts zu sagen.~
+@127  = ~Bitte, Haer'Dalis ist unschuldig!~
+@128  = ~Ihr werdet sprechen, falls Ihr nicht vom Dachbalken herab baumeln wollt!~
+@129  = ~Wollt Ihr nicht, daß jeder die Wahrheit erfährt?~
+@130  = ~Hat er Euch das gesagt?~
+@131  = ~Es - es gibt keinen Anlass für Drohungen!~
+@132  = ~Und ich vermute, mit 'jedem' meint Ihr Euch? Typisch. Aber schön, Ihr habt Euren Standpunkt verdeutlicht.~
+@133  = ~Ich habe den Mörder gesehen, ganz eindeutig. Ich war schon im Halbschlaf, aber hörte eine Rangelei aus dem Gemach von Lord Balthis und trat ein, nur um den Dieb zu finden, der mit seinen Schwertern über der Leiche stand.~
+@134  = ~Als nächstes sprang er aus dem Fenster, um zu entkommen. Nun, selbstverständlich hat er nicht auf die Wachen gewartet!~
+@135  = ~Kommissar Brega erwähnte den Raub. Erzählt mir mehr.~
+@136  = ~Ihr habt ihn 'den Dieb', nicht 'den Mörder' genannt. Warum?~
+@137  = ~Hat der Dieb etwas gestohlen?~
+@138  = ~Lord Balthis' unschätzbar Büste von Sune wird vermisst! Deshalb habe ich mich an den Dieb erinnert: Er war nur ein paar Tage zuvor hier um danach zu fragen.~
+@139  = ~Das wäre für einen Dieb eine ziemlich nahe liegende Handlungsweise, nicht wahr?~
+@140  = ~Was wäre, wenn Haer'Dalis und der Mann, den Ihr gesehen habt, zwei völlig unterschiedliche Personen wären?~
+@141  = ~Ihr könntet Euch jedoch bei dieser schwachen Beleuchtung geirrt haben. Was wenn es gar nicht Haer'Dalis war?~
+@142  = ~Darüber habe ich bisher noch nicht nachgedacht... aber ich habe es gesehen.~
+@143  = ~Hat jemals irgendwer sonst nach der Büste gefragt?~
+@144  = ~Könnt Ihr mir sonst noch etwas erzählen?~
+@145  = ~Nicht wirklich... Aber Quataris, ein Kunsthändler und Sammler auf der Promenade, war ziemlich neidisch darauf, daß Lord Balthis ihn bei der Versteigerung der Büste überboten hat. Das ist alles was ich sagen kann. Ich schlage vor, daß Ihr das Anwesen jetzt verlasst.~
+@146  = ~Das Anwesen ist gesperrt. Bitte, geht jetzt.~
+@147  = ~Ich bin hier um Euch ein paar Fragen zum Mörder von Acton Balthis zu stellen.~
+@148  = ~Was ist mit der Büste von Sune? Ich habe gehört, daß Ihr sehr interessiert daran wart.~
+@149  = ~Schon gut.~
+@150  = ~Natürlich.~
+@151  = ~Ich bin froh, daß der teuflische Dieb hinter Gitter gebracht wurde. Acton Balthis war ein guter Mann und ist ein großer Verlust für die Gemeinschaft der Künstler. Davon abgesehen habe ich nicht viel zu sagen.~
+@152  = ~Ich verstehe. Vielen Dank für Eure Zeit.~
+@153  = ~Das wäre erst mal alles.~
+@154  = ~Ich wurde bereits von Kommissar Brega zu all dem befragt. Es gibt keinen Grund Euch Eure Fragen zu beantworten! Zudem habe ich nichts mit diesem... Kunstwerk zu tun!~
+@155  = ~(Bluffen) Tatsächlich? Mein Freund Haer'Dalis hat Euch am Fenster von Lord Balthis gesehen.~
+@156  = ~Tatsächlich? Mein Freund Haer'Dalis hat Euch am Fenster von Lord Balthis gesehen.~
+@157  = ~Kommissar Brega hat sich anders geäußert.~
+@158  = ~Pip im Anwesen von Lord Balthis hat das Gegenteil behauptet.~
+@159  = ~Es reicht! Ich stehe hier nicht einfach und lasse mir das gefallen! Wachen!~
+@160  = ~Wachen! WACHEN!! Beschützt mich!!~
+@161  = ~Bitte, bitte tötet mich nicht.~
+@162  = ~Habt Ihr den Mörder beauftragt?~
+@163  = ~Gesteht, und ich werde Euer Leben verschonen.~
+@164  = ~Bitte, lasst mich einfach reden! Ich sage Euch alles was Ihr wissen müsst.~
+@165  = ~Wer braucht dieses wertlose Geständnis! Dieser Mann handelt mit seltenen Schriftrollen, verschollenen Reliquien, Artefakten von Nesseril! Nehmt das statt dessen, Ihr närrischer Affe! (Ich kann nicht glauben, daß ich mit so jemandem arbeiten muss.)~
+@166  = ~He, er windet sich wie ein glitschiger Wurm. Beendet dieses Elend einfach, Abbil.~
+@167  = ~Wahrlich, ein großes Unrecht wurde aufgedeckt. Ich würde es schätzen, wenn Ihr diesen Feigling dem Gesetz übergebt, mein Freund.~
+@168  = ~Das - das solltet Ihr besser! Haer'Dalis wäre wegen Euch beinahe gestorben!~
+@169  = ~Ja, ich wollte diese Büste von Sune. Es war ein wahrhaftiges Wunderwerk, der Marmor so glatt, das Gesicht so lebendig...~
+@170  = ~Ich habe Janos, einen ortsansässigen Söldner, beauftragt sie zu stehlen. Er ist ein Meister der Illusion, damit die... Angelegenheit einwandfrei verlaufen konnte. Aber etwas muss schief gelaufen sein...~
+@171  = ~Unterzeichnet dieses Geständnis und ich lasse Euch laufen.~
+@172  = ~Nun legt alles in diesem Schreiben nieder.~
+@173  = ~Lasst mich nur... ein Stück Pergament nehmen. Wenn meine Hände nur nicht so zittern würden...~
+@174  = ~Hier ist mein Geständnis, und hier ist auch die Büste von Sune. Bitte tötet mich nicht!~
+@175  = ~Das werde ich nicht. Aber Ihr habt meinen Freund beinahe das Leben gekostet.~
+@176  = ~Die Wachen werden Euch früh genug holen kommen.~
+@177  = ~Pech für Euch. Bereitet Euch auf den Tod vor!~
+@178  = ~Ich vermute, daß sie mich jetzt in die Zelle Eures Freundes werfen werden. Ist das nicht Strafe genug?~
+@179  = ~Nein! Hilf mir jemand!!~
+@180  = ~Ich will wissen weshalb mein Freund Haer'Dalis verhaftet wurde.~
+@181  = ~Hier ist die gestohlene Büste von Sune und das schriftliche Geständnis von Quataris. Ich will, daß Haer'Dalis befreit wird.~
+@182  = ~Hier ist das schriftliche Geständnis von Quataris. Ich will, daß Haer'Dalis befreit wird.~
+@183  = ~Hier ist die gestohlene Büste von Sune. Quataris der Kunsthändler hat dahinter gesteckt.~
+@184  = ~Ich habe Janos, den wahren Dieb, getötet. ~
+@185  = ~Euer Freund Haer'Dalis wurde dabei beobachtet wie er Acton Balthis getötet hat. Ich werde Euch nicht sagen von wem, aber wir haben ermittelt, daß der Zeuge nicht gelogen hat.~
+@186  = ~Das Motiv des Mörders war ursprünglich Raub, und ein wertvoller Gegenstand, eine Büste von Sune, wurde dem Anwesen entwendet. Haer'Dalis hat diesbezüglich gewisse Eingeständnisse gemacht, daher ist der Zusammenhang offensichtlich.~
+@187  = ~Pip, der Diener von Lord Balthis, hat das auch gesagt. Habt Ihr die Büste gefunden?~
+@188  = ~Ich verstehe. Wo könnte diese Büste jetzt sein?~
+@189  = ~Er hat eine Büste bewundert und wird alleine dafür hingerichtet? Sehr schlau.~
+@190  = ~Wurde diese Büste gefunden?~
+@191  = ~Es gab noch weitere Hinweise, wie ich bereits sagte. Ihr tut Eurem Freund mit diesem Tonfall keinen Gefallen.~
+@192  = ~Die Büste von Sune wurde nicht wiedergefunden, aber Haer'Dalis könnte sie nur an zwei Orten verkauft haben: Quataris, den Kunsthändler, oder die Schattendiebe.~
+@193  = ~Tatsächlich. Die Schattendiebe, sagt Ihr. Die haben offensichtlich nichts mit dieser Sache zu tun.~
+@194  = ~Vielleicht hat dieser Quataris etwas mit dem Mord an Lord Balthis zu tun?~
+@195  = ~Was glaubt Ihr wem der Dieb es verkauft haben könnte?~
+@196  = ~Die Schattendiebe würden es nicht wagen etwas vom Vizeregenten zu stehlen. Was Quataris betrifft, er sagt, daß er nichts dergleichen getan hat.~
+@197  = ~Ich kann nicht feststellen ob er lügt, da Händler seines Formats häufig durch Amulette und Talismane gegen magische Hellsicht geschützt sind.~
+@198  = ~Vielleicht solltet Ihr selbst mit Quataris sprechen. Sein Laden befindet sich auf der Promenade.~
+@199  = ~Oder sucht das Anwesen von Lord Balthis im Brückenbezirk auf, falls Ihr noch nicht da gewesen sein solltet.~
+@200  = ~Ihr habt nur wenig Zeit. Gesetz ist Gesetz: Euer Freund Haer'Dalis wurde dazu verurteilt in drei Tagen hingerichtet zu werden, ohne wenn und aber. Wenn Ihr seine Unschuld beweisen wollt, solltet Ihr Euch beeilen.~
+@201  = ~Das ist... ziemlich bemerkenswert. Ihr habt in der Tat gründliche Arbeit geleistet.~
+@202  = ~Obwohl das nicht genau das ist wonach ich gesucht habe, schürt es sicherlich etwas Zweifel an dieser Angelegenheit.~
+@203  = ~Ich danke Euch für Euren Einfallsreichtum. Hier ist der Freispruch für Euren Freund. Den werdet Ihr brauchen, um ihn aus dem Gefängnis zu befreien..~
+@204  = ~Geht mit meinem Dank und meiner aufrichtigen Entschuldigung. Und denkt daran: Für die Ergreifung des wahren Übeltäters gibt es eine angemessene Belohnung.~
+@205  = ~Das wurde mir bereits von den Wachen im Brückenbezirk mitgeteilt. Ihr habt erneut meinen Dank und den Dank der Stadt.~
+@206  = ~Was wisst Ihr über den Mörder von Lord Balthis?~
+@207  = ~Nicht viel. Kommissar Brega hat sich mit den Zeugen befasst. Der Täter war obendrein ein Dieb und hat etwas sehr wertvolles aus dem Anwesen entwendet.~
+@208  = ~Der Kommissar wird Euch vermutlich mehr erzählen. Oder Ihr könntet mit Pip, Lord Actons Diener, sprechen.~
+@209  = ~Vielleicht seid Ihr ebenfalls daran interessiert uns bei der Suche nach dem Mörder von Lord Balthis zu helfen. Sprecht mit seinem Diener Pip, falls Ihr das bisher versäumt habt. Ich bin sicher, daß Kommissar Brega Eure Hilfe zu schätzen weiß.~
+@210  = ~Schön zu hören, daß <CHARNAME> die scheußliche Angelegenheit mit dem Mörder von Lord Balthis geklärt hat! Wir waren ziemlich besorgt. Wer hätte gedacht, daß sie Euch verdächtigen würden, was?~
+@211  = ~Wisst Ihr etwas über den Mörder von Lord Balthis?~
+@212  = ~Nichts. Tatsache ist, daß der Kommissar selbst die Zeugen befragt, und er hält seine Karten bedeckt. Wir machen uns alle Sorgen um den armen Haer'Dalis.~
+@213  = ~Ihr scheint es besser zu wissen als ich. Der arme Haer'Dalis wurde exekutiert, und der echte Mörder läuft immer noch frei herum. Viel mehr habe ich dazu nicht zu sagen.~
+@214  = ~Ich habe von einem Cousin bei der Wache gehört, daß sie den Mord an Lord Acton aufgeklärt haben. Sie haben einen Barden oder so ähnlich aufgegriffen und ihn hinter Gitter gebracht. Tja, gut für sie, sage ich.~
+@215  = ~Ich bin so froh, daß der Mörder von Lord Acton verhaftet wurde! Dieser Barde kam mir schon immer seltsam vor.~
+@216  = ~Der Barde war unschuldig, nicht wahr? Ich kann es gar nicht glauben. Dieses fremdländische Volk steckt doch immer hinter irgend etwas.~
+@217  = ~Der Barde wurde frei gelassen? Hmpf. Nun, ich niemals!~
+@218  = ~Ihr! Derjenige, der den Barden aus dem Gefängnis geholt hat! Das hättet Ihr wirklich nicht tun sollen!~
+@219  = ~Ich habe ihm sein Gesicht genommen, und heute werde ich Euch das Leben nehmen! Jetzt beginnt der richtige Spaß!~
+@220  = ~Und Ihr habt den Barden bei Euch. Ein Pech für Euch, würde ich sagen!~
