Let's see, there are the ruins of an old mage school to the southeast. Traps, dead things that try to kill you, you know the schtick... Then there's the Firewine Bridge: ghosts, winding narrow passageways, some poetry, blah, blah, blah... Honestly, I can't think of a life more tedious than that of an adventurer. Personally, I get far more out of wandering around aimlessly and scratching my arse like this.~
