He told us that to access the lower portion of the area, we’ll have to travel across a bridge located south of his home into an old dwarven stronghold. From there, we’ll need to locate a room with statues of dwarven warriors, and find a secret door hidden along the wall where the statues are placed to progress further into the deeper regions of the complex.%)
