One does not usually change so drastically without nefarious help.  If there be an evil influence on him, perhaps the harsh justice of the military should be stayed.  He'll find no quarter at the garrison, but if he came to the temple.....well.....his restitution need not be his life.  Is there anything I can help you with?~

Now all we can do is say the proper prayers, and make sure the way to the next world is well guided.  May Helm have pity on his tortured soul.  Thank you for bringing his body him here.  No doubt Oublek would have made much of his death, and further despoiled his name.  I shall match the bounty you would have received, that you have not risked so much for nothing.
