@0    = ~Infidels!  How dare you profane our summoning chamber!  This holy place is reserved for those of *high class* and solemn bearing.  You will suffer greatly for your vile, corrupting intrusion into our domain!~
@1    = ~No, it is *you* who will suffer, monster!~
@2    = ~You know what?  You're not scaring me.~
@3    = ~Sorry about the intrusion.  I'll just close the door on my way out...~
@4    = ~I don't think so.  Your cowardice sickens me.  Your pathetic gods granted you the blessing of a backbone.  It is clear to me now that you unholy wretches have degenerated to the point where you don't even have that.  No scales, no tail, no backbone, no purpose... truly a wretched form of "life."  I will put you out of your misery.~
