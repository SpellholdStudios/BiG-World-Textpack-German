@0    = ~Well, well.  What have we here?  To whom do I owe the pleasure of this visit?~
@1    = ~I'll be asking the questions.  Who are you?~
@2    = ~Lower Dorn's Deep.

I met Marketh in a small palace in Lower Dorn's Deep.  He was a shifty man who fancied himself to be the new ruler of Dorn's Deep.~
@3    = ~I am called <CHARNAME>.  Who are you?~
@4    = ~You must be Marketh.  I've heard about you.~
@5    = ~I am Lord Chamberlain Marketh.  I'm responsible for making sure that New Dorn's Deep runs efficiently, among other things.~
@6    = ~Even if you have to crush a few gnomes into the ground to do it, eh?~
@7    = ~Lord Chamberlain?  New Dorn's Deep?  That's a little pretentious, don't you think?~
@8    = ~Ah.  Marketh.  You're the guy who likes beating up women.  You must feel like a really big man.~
@9    = ~You have?  Terrific!  News travels quickly even on the outskirts of the Underdark, it seems.  I'm glad to see that New Dorn's Deep is getting a reputation.~
@10   = ~New Dorn's Deep?  It seems like New Dorn's Deep is nothing more than a slave camp.  Aren't you being a little pretentious?~
@11   = ~Yeah, you have a reputation for beating up women.  You feel like you're a big man because you can beat up Ginafae?~
@12   = ~If my superior needs something done, it must be done, whatever the cost.  I don't have the luxury or time to be burdened with ethics.~
@13   = ~Have you ever stopped to consider the possibility that your superior is *evil?*~
@14   = ~Hmm.  I guess that is kind of a difficult situation to be in.~
@15   = ~Ah.  I like your attitude.  Is there any chance I could do business with you and your superior?~
@16   = ~Certainly not.  We believe that New Dorn's Deep is going to be the center of a very impressive community in the coming years.  A community which the dwarves will have no part in, of course.~
@17   = ~You're living in a dream world, Marketh.~
@18   = ~Interesting.  Crazy, but interesting.~
@19   = ~Yeah, I guess I do feel like I'm pretty big.  After all, I'm a human man and Ginafae's a dark elf woman.  They're not very sturdy.  It's pretty easy to just throw them around if they lip off to you.~
@20   = ~You black-hearted rat.  You're actually *joking* about beating up a woman?~
@21   = ~Why don't you try picking on someone your own size?~
@22   = ~Heh.  You're a funny guy.  How'd you wind up here?~
@23   = ~Oh, here it comes.  "You're grinding up people and destroying their lives... blah, blah, blah... the children... blah, blah, blah..."  I didn't claw my way to the top of the heap just to be taken down by something as pathetic as moral sentiment.  Give it a rest.~
@24   = ~No, I *won't* just give it a rest.  You'll pay for what you've done.~
@25   = ~How did you wind up here, anyway?~
@26   = ~Exactly.  Moral fortitude is easy to display when your life is all bunny rabbits and rainbows.  Down here in the lava pools of Dorn's Deep, everything's not quite so... pleasant.  If I wasn't doing this, someone else would be.~
@27   = ~That's no excuse.  I hold you responsible for the villainous deeds taking place down here.  I'll make you pay for your crimes.~
@28   = ~Nice rationale.  I understand what you're saying, but it still seems pretty shallow.~
@29   = ~Makes sense to me.  Say, is there any chance I could get in on the action?~
@30   = ~Oh, I'm sorry, but you've done enough damage already, friend.  Run along now.~
@31   = ~You don't get it, do you Marketh?  I came here for your badge.  I'm not going anywhere until you hand it over.~
@32   = ~Ah, but this dream *will* come true, my friends.  There is nothing anyone can do to stop it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to.~
@33   = ~You don't get it, do you Marketh?  I came here for your badge.  You're not going anywhere until you hand it over.~
@34   = ~Ha!  We'll see who's crazy when our forces march across Icewind Dale.  It will truly be a sight to behold.  Now, you must excuse me.  I have someplace I'd rather be right now.~
@35   = ~Yes, farewell indeed.~
@36   = ~It's better than being serious about beating up men.  That's practically all Ginafae did before Malavon brought her here.  She was a priestess of Lolth!  Abusing her "inferior male servants" was practically her entire job.  Malavon is her brother, and if you've met him, you *know* how deranged he is.  Now, if you'll excuse me...~
@37   = ~No, no thank you.  If I did that, I could get hurt.  Badly.  I think I'll just stick to avenging my sex's mistreatment at Ginafae's hands.  She used to be a priestess of Lolth, using her snake whip on every male in sight, including her brother, Malavon.  She deserves every beating I give her.  At least my fists don't send magical waves of pain shooting through her body.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll be leaving before you decide to jump me.~
@38   = ~Well, I used to be part of a silly adventuring company.  I was in it for the money.  They were in it for some sort of "noble cause."  That's what brought us here.  They came to stop Poquelin.  After we had slaughtered most of Poquelin's beast minions, he offered us all jobs working for him.~
@39   = ~Of course, the stupid paladin starting spouting off about how Poquelin would pay for his evil, and so on.  That's when I decided to slip my dagger into our wizard's back.  He died without a sound.  I killed our priest, too.  Poquelin made short work of the paladin.  He appreciated my help and my style.  The rest is history.~
@40   = ~You bastard.  I hate traitors.~
@41   = ~Dishonorable fiend!  I will avenge the death of my holy brother-in-arms.  Prepare to defend yourself, scum!~
@42   = ~So, you like killing mages, eh?  I can guarantee that you're not going to die without a sound.~
@43   = ~Hmm.  Interesting.~
@44   = ~Well too bad, kid.  Keep yourself alive... that's the name of the game.  Speaking of which, I think I'll be leaving now.  Farewell, fools.~
@45   = ~Guess what, Sir Goodytums?  If you think I'm going to stick around to watch you do a dramatic vengeance dance for me, you're wrong.  Farewell, idiot.~
@46   = ~Whoops.  I suppose it was crude of me to talk about killing mages in front of a practitioner of "The Art."  Oh well, no matter.  By the time you wiggle your fingers, I'll be long gone.  Oh, and the next time you're in the shadows... watch your back.  Farewell, speedy.~
@47   = ~Yes, well... I like to think so.  Story time is over now, children.  I'd best be making my exit.  Farewell.~
@48   = ~This morning, I woke up and realized that my little ring was a fake and that my little concubine is dead.  I have no idea who you are, but I feel safe in assuming that *you* are responsible.~
@49   = ~Yes.  Good guess.~
@50   = ~You are correct.  You've reached the end of your rule, Marketh.~
@51   = ~You know, you look like a  reasonable person.  I'm just a thief.  I'm not looking for a fight.  I don't suppose there's any chance you'd just take the badge and let me go, is there?~
@52   = ~Yes, actually.  I promised Ginafae I wouldn't hurt you.  Hand over the badge and I'll let you go.~
@53   = ~Hmm... I've got an idea, Marketh.  Why don't you hand over the badge *and* all of your armor and weapons?  I don't want you causing any trouble.~
@54   = ~Hmm... I guess so.  Just give me the badge and get out of here.~
@55   = ~No.  No chance at all.  Your time has come, Marketh.~
@56   = ~I should have killed you the first time I saw you.  I knew you'd be trouble.  Well, you've done it.  Malavon worded his contingency too literally.  Since she didn't physically cross the border of the palace, she wasn't affected by Malavon's spells.  You both outsmarted me.~
@57   = ~If I didn't think you were degenerate scum, I'd appreciate the complement.~
@58   = ~Ah, what a sweet girl she is.  Very well.  Say goodbye to Poquelin for me.  Farewell.~
@59   = ~Very well.  If you're so anxious for death, come and get it.~
@60   = ~Ah... you're truly a saint.  I'm sure Ilmater will give you a big pat on the head when you die.  Farewell.~
@61   = ~Ugh... how embarrassing.  Fine, here's my Black Dragon Scale... you know how hard it is to get this?  Here's my sword.  Uh, I don't suppose there's any chance you'd let me keep this ring around my neck, is there?  At least leave me *something.*~
@62   = ~No.  Sorry, Marketh.  Hand over everything.~
@63   = ~Okay, you can keep your precious ring.~
@64   = ~*sigh*  Fine.  Here you go.  Farewell.~
