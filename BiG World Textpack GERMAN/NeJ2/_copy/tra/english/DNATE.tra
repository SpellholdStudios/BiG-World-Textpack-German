@0    = ~I knew you'd make it through.  I just knew it!  ~
@1    = ~Who are you, and how did you know we were coming?~
@2    = ~Well, hooray for you.  Now get out my way, kid.~
@3    = ~Thanks for the vote of confidence.  Farewell.~
@4    = ~I'm Nate.  Arundel said that help was on its way.  I've been out here every day, keeping a lookout for you.  Where is the rest of your army?  Are you just the scouts or something?~
@5    = ~Sorry to disappoint you, but we are alone.~
@6    = ~Who is Arundel?~
@7    = ~I think you have the wrong idea... we're just passing through.  Farewell.~
@8    = ~Alone?  I thought for sure that the Ten-Towns would send an army to help us.  Wait 'til Arundel finds out it's just you.~
@9    = ~Who says we are here to *help* you?  Maybe we are here to murder little boys who talk too much.~
@10   = ~Arundel's my friend.  He's the oldest and smartest man in the whole world.  He can talk to animals, you know.  You should probably go see him... he'll be wanting to talk to you too.~
@11   = ~Very well.  Where can we find this Arundel?~
@12   = ~Thanks for the tip.  Farewell.~
@13   = ~He lives across this bridge, on the other side of the brook.  Just look for the house with the three big rocks out front.~
@14   = ~Thanks, Nate.  Farewell.~
@15   = ~Eeeeek!  Momma!  Momma!  They're gonna kill me!~
@16   = ~If you haven't already, you should go see Arundel.  I'm sure he'll want to know that you have arrived.  I'm gonna stay here and keep a lookout.  Maybe they'll send us an army after all.~
@17   = ~You do that, Nate.  Farewell.~
@18   = ~Hello again.  Arundel says you're gonna help save the town.  I hope he's right.  I hope you don't get squashed by a giant or something.~
@19   = ~We'll try not to let that happen.  Farewell, Nate.~
@20   = ~Oh, it's you.  Where have you been?  Did you see the monsters?  They came out of the mountains and started attacking the town.  I saw them from my lookout post...  a bunch of big, scary looking orcs led by a man in grey.~
@21   = ~Tell me about the man in grey.  Who was he?~
@22   = ~I don't know... I've never seen him around here before.  I watched him go into Arundel's house while the monsters attacked the town.  I hope Arundel's all right.~
@23   = ~Well done, Nate.  Keep up the good work.  Farewell.~
@24   = ~You're back.  I'm glad you're still alive.  Now that Arundel is gone, you're our only hope.  Please don't die until you've saved the town, ok?~
@25   = ~We'll do our best.  Farewell, Nate.~
