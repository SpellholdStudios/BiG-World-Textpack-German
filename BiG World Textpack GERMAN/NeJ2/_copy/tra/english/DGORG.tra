@6    = ~What are you doing down here?~
@7    = ~Can you tell me anything about these caverns?~
@8    = ~I am curious about the cave to the north.  Do you know anything about it?~
@9    = ~I will be going now.  Farewell.~
@10   = ~Gorg.  That’s my name. ~
@11   = ~I have some questions for you.~
@12   = ~I must be leaving now.  Farewell.~
@13   = ~See the pen over there?  I’m watching those good for nothing slaves...  Well, they were good for nothing.  We found a use for them, though!~

@21   = ~Go past the slave pens and follow the passage to the left.  It will lead you to the throne room.~

@23   = ~Who or what is Frostbite?~
@24   = ~Bah!  Look around, small one.  You’ll learn more than you want to know about these caverns.  I’ve nothing to tell you.~

@29   = ~I killed him.~
@30   = ~I slew him to end the sacrifice of the slaves. ~
@31   = ~I cannot say.  I have some more questions for you.~
@32   = ~Well, good riddance to him.~
@33   = ~Oh really?  Well, I guess I’m going to have to slay you for that.  Die scum!~
@34   = ~So be it!~
