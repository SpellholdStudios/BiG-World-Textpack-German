@4    = ~Freed from the shackles of his tormented mind, the cursed elven lord was at last able to assist the heroes in their quest. Handing over the Heartstone Gem, the party stood back and watched Larrel begin his divination. With the artifact raised before him, clutched tightly in his skeletal hands, the undead sorcerer peered intently into the Gem as he whispered a series of strange chants and incantations. A spark of light briefly flashed within the Gem, as if a ray of sunlight had caught upon its surface. And suddenly, reflected within the mirrored facets of the stone, there appeared an image of a statue.  The statue was clearly a monument of sorts, depicting an elf and a dwarf sitting side by side on a dual throne.~ [scry]
@5    = ~So it was that the patchwork militia set off from Easthaven, bound for the troubled village of Kuldahar with the party of strangers in tow. On they traveled, across the windswept tundra of the Dale, through the foothills of the Spine of the World, and upwards on the steep and treacherous trails of the Kuldahar Pass. Eager to seek out the evil that threatened the Pass, they did not expect it to find them first.  High upon the cliffs of the Pass, a band of frost giants had prepared an ambush. Hurling boulders and dislodging massive outcroppings of rock and snow, the giants sparked an avalanche that thundered down the mountainside and crashed down upon the heads of the unsuspecting expedition. Those fortunate enough to survive the avalanche pulled themselves free of the mountain of snow and bodies that now barred the way back to Easthaven. Battered and disheartened by the loss of their comrades, the survivors had little choice but to continue on to Kuldahar... alone.~ [avalanch]
@6    = ~Fighting their way through the goblin-infested valley of the pass, the survivors of the doomed Easthaven expedition at last came upon the small hamlet of Kuldahar. Nestled within the roots of a massive oak tree, the tiny cottages were a welcome sight for the weary travelers. As the party approached the town, a warm breeze blew over them, chasing away the chill of the frozen pass and carrying with it the sweet scent of cooking fires.~ [NARR_CH1]
@7    = ~Hrothgar pulled from his pocket a strange small black box which you had not seen before now, then pointing it at you and.... Without further warning you suddenly find yourself pulled in to what you can only describe as a vortex of air. Before you have time to utter a word the sensation passes and you find yourself standing at the entrance to what appears to have once been a majestic tower but is now no more than a fallen ruin.~ [intro2]
@8    = ~In the heat of the battle, the twisted priest of Ilmater stumbled, gripping his chest as if mortally stricken. A faint glow began to emanate from the crystal that hung around his neck. Suddenly the entire cave was engulfed in an explosion of blinding light. When the light finally died, the party discovered that they were no longer within the dark passages of Dorn's Deep. As they struggled to regain their bearings, they realized that they had been returned to the town of Easthaven. But this was not the sleepy fishing village they had left so long ago. An enchantment had fallen over the town, encasing what remained of the shattered homes and buildings in a prison of solid ice. At the center of the destruction, upon the very spot where the temple of Tempus once stood, rose a massive tower of crystal.~ [RETURN]
@9    = ~You feel something strange is heaving and pulling you inside... back to your future.~ [ThemeNEJ]
@10   = ~Somehow we were teleported from the strange dungeon to the snowy, lakefront community known as Easthaven. Weary and half-frozen from the road, we hastily made our way into the local tavern to find a hot meal and some friendly conversation. Scarcely had we seated ourselves at a table by the hearth when we were approached by a burly warrior who introduced himself as Hrothgar.~ [intro1]
@11   = ~We have agreed to search for a missing druidic artifact called the Heartstone Gem. Apparently, it was stolen from the druids of Kuldahar years ago by one of their own. Arundel believes that it might be located within a temple that lies in a canyon far to the east of Kuldahar. We are to travel to this temple and discover if the Heartstone is indeed there. If it is, we are to return it to Arundel so that he may use its power to divine the location of the true evil behind the disturbances in the pass.~ [intro3]
@12   = ~Our search for the Heartstone Gem continues. Arundel has managed to piece together the possible location of the Gem from the clues we discovered at the temple. We are to journey to the volcanic caverns known as Dragon‘s Eye and discover the identities of the mysterious thieves who sacked the temple and stole the Gem. Hopefully, the artifact is still in their possession. After a day's journey through the mountains surrounding Kuldahar, the small band of would-be heroes finally stood before the towering crag of rock that marked the entrance to Dragon's Eye. Somewhere within the depths of the volcanic cavern lay the missing Heartstone Gem, and perhaps with it, the answer to who or what was behind the disturbances in Kuldahar.~ [intro4]
@13   = ~Hrothgar was surprised to find Tilorn waiting for us on our arrival at Ulcaster and I was equally surprised to learn that this Tilorn knew me by name. It would appear that he and Hrothgar are old friends... something he omitted to mention when I asked him about Tilorn’s mysterious visit to Arundel in Kuldahar. After a brief introduction Tilorn set about explaining his reason for being at Ulcaster... an incredulous story. It would appear there is something amiss in the realms, something upsetting the balance between past and future... Tilorn believes it all began with the untimely fall of Ulcaster after an assault by Halruaa, an academy for specialist magic. He proposes to send us to Halruaa, prior to the event which led to Ulcaster’s downfall... once there we are to find that which sparked the assault and prevent it from happening. Thus preserving all the knowledge contained in Ulcaster’s walls that may be of help in averting the impending chaos in the future. Tilorn’s arrival at Ulcaster before our own only leads me to believe that both he and Hrothgar are keeping much from me and yet they expect me to trust and aid them without question. Tilorn’s fantastic tale of the balance between past and future being upset brings to my mind the conversation between Hrothgar and Gorion that I witnessed whilst travelling the portal from Kuldahar... *I already feel the adverse effects the imbalance between future and past is having on The Realms*... those were the words Hrothgar spoke and now Tilorn speaks of the same imbalance. Was it a dream I now find myself asking, or maybe a glimpse of another time as I fell through the dimensions back to the present, and why was Hrothgar so quick to dismiss it as such? Perhaps by accepting Tilorn’s task I may discover who these two men are who speak of travelling through time as though it were as simple as opening a door. If Hrothgar of Easthaven weren’t standing beside me now I would say Tilorn was insane... as it is who am I to judge what is and what isn’t possible anymore. So I have agreed to help and now stand stripped of all armour and weapons, clothed in wizard robes... ready to depart for Halruaa.~ [intro5]
@14   = ~The Heartstone‘s divination had at last revealed the source of the evil in the mountains. Ahead loomed the solitary peak that housed the dwarven stronghold known as Dorn’s Deep.  With Larrel’s warnings of dwarven treachery still ringing in their ears, the heroes readied their weapons and started towards the cave entrance and whatever challenges lay beyond.~ [narr_ch4]
@15   = ~Once again Hrothgar pulls his strange device from his pocket and points it at you. This time you know what to expect so you brace yourself in anticipation of the coming rush to your senses. Still, you catch your breath as you feel the energy of the vortex whirl around you and carry you to its centre. Then, as quickly as it had begun, the sensation is over, and, as you let out your breath, you find yourself once more standing in front of the ruined elven fortress.~ [intro2]

On another occasion, Bron‘s cowardly companions abandoned him when they were attacked by dire wolves in the wilderness.  Two weeks later, Bron swaggered into their camp wearing wolfskins.  Whether all of the tales surrounding Bron are true or not, it is known that Bron is believed to have met his end in the Spine of the World mountains, fighting polar worms.

The value of the card (unknown to the user) determines the duration of the effect.  These cards used to be employed by the warrior minions of Porg the Stout.

"One of the first steps towards living in harmony with animals is learning to respect our ever-changing relationship with animals.  Many people think of humans and demihumans as being superior to animals.  However, as I‘ve already stated, the criteria for ‘superiority‘ is very subjective.  For this reason, we must view our relationship with the animals of the wild on a personal and ever-changing basis.  Give the creatures the respect they deserve, but always remember that predators are predators, no matter how much you respect their territory."~

@193  = ~An excerpt...

"... our principle stance is one of rejection.  The fundamental beliefs of the churches of fury are anathema to our own.  The Gods of Fury stress everything that is selfish, physically abusive, and destructive.  The Malarites care only for proving their temporal power through the senseless butchering of animals.  The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains.  Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure.  Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god.  As much as we Eldathyn might denounce the beliefs of these religions, there is an even greater question to be asked.  What kind of afterlife can these self-serving priests expect to find in the domains of their self-serving gods?"~

Unfortunately, these bumbling buffoons haven‘t spent enough time researching all of the different types of ivy to learn their subtle differences.  Why, just the other day, some fool on the hill told me that Jangling Bell Ivy should be planted in relatively moist soil next to Blossoming Garters.  As any ivy scholar worth his weight in dirt knows, Blossoming Garters require such a huge amount of water that one would drown the Jangling Bell just by tending to the Garters.  ‘Moist‘ does not mean ‘soaked.‘  I ask you, what will it take to educate these comical jesters of the scientific community?"~

... Aside from the High Mages, none are certain about the true nature of mythals, no matter how well versed they are in ancient elven lore of old or current debates on magical theory.  Many agree that a mythal is alive, and is a huge web of magical forces woven together by magic and the lifeforces of the casters.  The mythal is believed to be sustained by the natural mechanisms within and around it, from the wind to the current of a brook or a temperature shift from the energy of sunlight.  Given the ties to life and Faerun, mythals can hardly be common wizardry, no matter what may have been said in the past.  The mythals and their magic are tied directly to the Weave, the source of all Torillian magic...~

The first monk scooped the beautiful lady up in his arms and carried her across the stream, promptly setting her down and continuing on his way.  The second monk remained silent for several minutes as the woman disappeared from view.  Finally he spoke to his brother.

‘We shukenja are not supposed to have contact with women!  Why did you pick that woman up so casually and carry her across the stream?‘

‘Brother, I set the woman down long ago.  Why is it that you have not?‘"~

"... we Eldathyn believe that the only real way to live honestly is to resist the temptation to strike out in anger when things are against us.  Violence arises from suffering and, as a result, can do nothing but cause more suffering in its occurrence.  Some of our critics point to the state of nature to invalidate our philosophy.  Some believe that the existence of storms and tremors in nature proves that nature is inherently violent.

There is a simple argument against this, however.  Nature is a gift from the gods, but it functions as an independent system, a science, if you will.  Nature is not inherently violent because disposition towards violence is a property only thinking beings possess.  While there are violent acts in nature, nature is not inherently violent.  Nature is simply nature... "~

The number of men, women, and children Apali killed with the aid of the bow is almost unbelievable, as the soldier waged war against humans for hundreds of years before he was finally laid low in Chessenta by a priest of Assuran, god of vengeance.  Apali had killed the priest‘s great-great grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier.  The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow.  The red and black bandings represent Apali‘s family, from a caste of priests.  The snake heads represent Sseth, the god of the yuan-ti.

During Alerri‘s early days in the priesthood, he frequently provoked and attacked agents of Sune.  Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair‘s followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite‘s antics.  Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep.  After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic.  He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit‘s creation.  Following his master‘s instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail.  He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours.  When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate.  Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years.  His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn.  The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious.  

Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva‘s secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar.  With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her.  When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury.  The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge.  Gaedel‘s family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at loss of most of their house.  Mithran‘s cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake.

Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior‘s funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man‘s fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the like.

The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old.  The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush.  It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

Kath was fond of destroying peasant militias to send a warning to other communities.  He used this sword to that end.  When the nervous defenders tried to form a line of pikes, Kath and other heavily armoured men would wade into the fray, hacking their weapons apart and breaking their formation.  Once the villagers had been sent into disarray, his men would fall in with cavalry and take what they wanted.  Kath eventually met his end when a rival warlord, Marhap the Blackbeard, destroyed Kath‘s army.

At the end of this time, the scales are burned and rolled in another mixture of oils and powders until it takes on the consistency of thick butter.  A variety of spells are then cast upon the mixture to give the oil its full powers.  When used, the target‘s skin becomes tough, green, and scaly.

A powerful weapon and tool, this staff was created by the powerful archmage Ubath of the Celestial Sign. Originally of Algarond, Ubath commanded great respect for his skills as a summoner of beasts and elementals. Unfortunately, Ubath‘s desire for power drove him to extreme lengths. His conjuring of extremely powerful entities from the lower planes is what eventually did him in. This staff is his most prominent legacy. It was left behind, slightly blackened, when he was dragged away to Acheron.

He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead.  He considered undead to be, in his words, "Unoriginal, tired old jokes."  "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of?  They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time.  I‘m supposed to be scared of that?"  He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way.  Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power.  Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death.  Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead.  He was not as light-hearted about the walking dead after that.

They are even more dedicated to the ancient ways and styles of dress than other Silver elves.  They often tattoo themselves with old runes and symbols and their armor and weapon are all of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship.~

From the gentle aspects of art and poetry to the hasher aspects of war and magic, he is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except that of the drow.

Negotiations are over with our former friends.  We are now in open conflict with them.  As much as I love my father, I blame him for this.  Ever since we found the weapons in the horde‘s possession, father has been completely irrational.  Any discussions had with our former friends ended in bitter accusations and resentment.  He adamantly believes that the dwarves betrayed us and listens to nothing they have to say in their defense.  

Am I the only one who sees that both sides are going to die horribly if this continues?  Father does not see reason in putting aside hostilities with the dwarves so that we may unite against our common enemy.  I spoke to him of going Dorn‘s Deep to approach our old friends.  He lashed out at me in anger and sent me out of the astrolabe.  

I now make preparations to leave home and ride to Dorn‘s Deep myself.  I know in my heart what must be done and this is the only way.  Perhaps I have more of my father‘s stubbornness than I thought.~
@359  = ~Hippogriff Riders of the Hand~
@360  = ~Hippogriff Rides of the Hand

Stationed atop Sheverash Tower are the proud hippogriffs of the Seldarine‘s Hand.  Along with their riders, these mounts serve primarily as scouts but are sometimes used for missions requiring the utmost of speed.  
Both rider and mount are trained rigorously to work as a team.  Upon hatching, hippogriffs are domesticated to be used as mounts.  They are trained in what to eat, various combat routines involving aerial and ground attacks, and to respond to the commands of its rider.  The riders are educated in the ways of grooming and caring for its mount, how to work effectively with his hippogriff, and also in the ways of aerial and ground combat.
  As a unit, they have proven excellent aerial support in our ground battles and are a proud symbol of the Seldarine.~
@361  = ~Ancient Lore on Labelas Enoreth~
@362  = ~Ancient Lore on Labelas Enoreth
By Master E. L. Boyd

  Labelas Enoreth is the elven god of longevity and time.  At the creation of the Fair Folk, Labelas blessed the elves with long lifespans and decreed that their appearances would not be marked by the passage of time.  The lifegiver cooperates with Sehanine in overseeing the lifespan of elves and their growth away from and beyond the mortal realms.  He measures the lives of the Fair Folk and decrees when they should be ended, allowing passage to Arvandor.  As Lord of the Continuum, Labelas governs the orderly passage of time and guards against those who would alter the path of history.  Labelas confers wisdom and teachings on young and old alike, and although he is rarely invoked, the Lifegiver is often praised.  The Lifegiver knows the future and past of every elf, faerie, or sylvan creature.  Labelas is worshiped by sages, historians, philosophers, librarians, and all those who measure the changes wrought by the passing of years.~
@363  = ~Ancient Lore on Sehanine Moonbow~
@364  = ~Ancient Lore on Sehanine Moonbow
By Master E. L. Boyd

  ...Sehanine Moonbow is the elven goddess of the moon or, more specifically, the full moon.  She governs divinations, omens, and subtle magics and protects against madness.  She watches over the dreams of the elves, keeping them from harm while in reverie and sending omens to protect them from future dangers.  Sehanine watches over the passage of the elven spirits from the world, and she is protectress of the dead...
  ...Alternately called the wife and daughter of Corellon, Sehanine is the mightiest of the female powers in the elven pantheon.  Identified with the mystic power of the moon, Sehanine‘s tears are said to have mingled with Corellon‘s blood and given life to the elven race.~

@366  = ~"Rock Eaters", They are Not

...contrary to popular belief, our Dwarven friends do not exist on a diet of rocks and dirt.  I was recently invited to visit their wonderful stronghold, Dorn‘s Deep.  In this architectural wonder, hidden away in one of the most beautiful forests in the North, I entered figuring to be covered in soot from some filthy underground mine unbefitting a High Elf of my stature.  Much to my surprise, my eyes were instead treated to amazing works of beauty and craftsmanship.  Our Dwarven friends proceeded to take me on a tour, pointing out each piece in thorough detail.  I smiled.  Impressed that one of the lesser races had such talent in them to create such works.  Of course, they paled in comparison to what our Elven artisan‘s can do, but this was not the time to point out their flaws...~
@367  = ~Ancient Lore on Shevarash~
@368  = ~Ancient Lore on Shevarash
By Master E. L. Boyd

  Shevarash, who embodies the hatred as the Fair Folk hold for the drow, is the elven god of vengeance and military crusades.  He is venerated by the elves and half-elves who have suffered the loss of loved ones through violence, particularly those who burn with revenge against the drow, and by those who have sworn to destroy the Spider Queen and the other evil gods of the dark elves.  Some elven theologians speculate that Shevarash serves to gather in the bitterness and hatred that has riven the elven race since the Crown Wars, thus keeping the contagious evil of the Spider Queen from spreading to the elven population at large.~
@369  = ~Ancient Lore on Solonor Thelandira~
@370  = ~Ancient Lore on Solonor Thelandira
By Master E. L. Boyd

Solonor Thelandira is the elven god of hunting, archery, and survival in wild and harsh places.  The Great Archer‘s prowess with the bow is unmatched by any other power venerated in the Realms.  Solonor is concerned with the integrity of nature and the balance between exploitation and agriculture on one hand and fallow, wild terrains on the other...
  ...He instructs the Fair Folk in the art of hiding in and moving through natural foliage so as not to be detected as well as the art of archery and hunting.  Solonor is primarily revered by elven and half-elven rangers, hunters, woodsmen, and fighters.  In particular, elven hunters appeal to him for better catches of game and elven warriors trapped in hostile territory call on him for aid...~
@371  = ~Ecology of the Unicorn~
@372  = ~Ecology of the Unicorn

Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and grasses.  Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures that destroy forests, in particular red dragons and orcs.
The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known to surpass 1,000 years.  They are believed to maintain their youth until death is only weeks away.  The secret to this longevity is the strong magical nature of the horn.  Unicorn horns are maliciously  sought after, since possession of one is a sovereign remedy against all poisons.~
@373  = ~Worship in the Hand of the Seldarine~
@374  = ~Worship in the Hand 
By Denaini

...day in and day out, the Elves of the Hand worked diligently to further the cause of the Alliance.  Although dedicated to their work, they always remained devout to the elven gods.  A shrine was created within Solonor Tower that would allow us elves to offer simple worship with what spare moments were available.  

A beautiful flower garden can be found on one end of this level.  With care, an elf would take a flower from the garden, approach the appropriate statue of the god they wished to pray to, place the flower in the statue‘s pond, and pray for however long they had.~
@375  = ~Boots of the Fox~
@376  = ~These gaudy red and green boots were worn by the rogue Elpham of Perrywine.  Elpham was a pickpocket of exceptional talent who pressed his luck by taunting his victims shortly after taking their loot.  After being caught twice, Elpham invested his money in having these boots made.  Of course, Elpham came to an untimely end when he picked the pocket of the notoriously ill-tempered Red Wizard of Thay, Xain Morobdel.  Elpham stole a pouch full of gems off of Xain‘s waist and danced off into the crowd shouting, "Why don‘t you try to chase me back to the Priador, baldy?  Ha ha!"  Xain, quietly fuming, promptly summoned four invisible stalkers and commanded them to, "Kill the idiot in the red and green boots."

@380  = ~One of the only musical instruments actively approved of by the church of Tempus, the Cittern of War was constructed by a halfling instrument maker named Relias Blackseed.  Priests of Arvoreen the Defender blessed the cittern with its impressive power.  Relias never intended to play his magnificent creation.  He eventually sold the ruddy instrument to a bard named Gallow Deely.  Gallow was a lanky, slender man often found in the company of adventurers.  Though ill-suited for battle, Gallow was exceptionally gifted at putting tales of heroism to music.  With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR.  His song, commemorating the occasion, was a rollicking tune called "The Fight of Green Thirteen."  It is played in central and western taverns to this day.

Bemban grew senile in his later years, and left most of his fortune to private mages in the hope that they would continue to make his favorite magical hat.

@412  = ~Owain‘s Lullabye was created by a disturbed bard named Owain Piper.  Piper was a worshipper of Auril, born in the town of Silverymoon and raised to embrace the frigid environment of his homeland.  He traveled extensively in the Moonsea, where he met a mage named Pelham of the Moor.  Owain and Pelham became good friends and stayed in contact for over a decade.  Pelham eventually enchanted Owain‘s Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money.  Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake.  He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter.  As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain‘s horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

STATISTICS:

When played, this instrument casts Cone of Cold for 2-5 hit points of cold damage per level of the caster.  The cone is 35 feet long and 20 feet in diameter.

She, however, gave birth to a half-monstrous child, to whom she was so attached to in her madness that none dared to kill the child, as it is customary done. Dar grew in the sanctuary of Ilmater. He was educated and tutored by priests, though he does not exhibit slurry speech and after knowing him for a while you‘d come to a conclusion that he might not be the brightest fellow, but he has a heart of gold, and a gentle and noble soul, and shows no trait of the savagery of his orcish heritage. He displays great loyalty to those that take the time to befriend him. When you ask him about his atypically fluent speech, he tells you that he owes his excellent knowledge and usage of the common tongue, rarely found in his kind, to the patience and tutoring of the priests that raised him.

When first you speak to Hrothgar you get a sense that you should know this burly man but the feeling passes as quickly as it came. If you ask Hrothgar about what rumour and legend say of him, he will laugh loudly and say, "So that is what the name Hrothgar has come to mean is it."

 RayVon has asked that I bring our next and final briefing forward as he wants us and the leveller to be the first wave against Ulcaster. He is hoping that with the leveller at our disposal, we will be all the force that will be needed to bring Ulcaster down. 
 He sends his apologies and ask that we preside over this meeting as a matter that needs his immediate attention has been brought to his notice by Caius... something about new students. I didn’t think Halruaa was taking in any new students until this business with Ulcaster and his damn academy had been dealt with... anyway it is imperative that Garron now be given instructions on deployment of the leveller. So Vrielle, could you please contact Brial and ask her to bring him with her. 
 Do not delay your own arrival as there is much we need to discuss before the others arrive.

 Sebastian has brought forward our meeting, after which Garron will be taken to the leveller and instructed on how to deploy it. 
 You know where we are to meet, please find and bring Garron with you but do not be late yourself. If you can not contact him, then leave directions in his quarters as to where he may find us. 
	
	Vrielle.~
@706  = ~Garron,
 We have all been summoned for a final brief. The time for talking has come to an end and it is now time to put our plans into action... the leveller is ready and your hour has come Garron. 
 Sebastian has asked that you accompany me to this meeting so that you may learn how to deploy it. Against the leveller... Ulcaster shall not prevail.
 I couldn’t wait any longer for your return so I have written directions to where we are meeting. Please, for obvious reasons, don’t leave them lying around after you have read them.
 Just to the left of my room you‘ll find the secret entrance to sewers. I will unlock one of the deactivated portals there to let you enter our meeting chamber, and I hope to see you there as soon as possible.  
	
	Brial.~
@707  = ~Vrielle,
 I trust Sebastian has explained my forced absence at this brief. However this letter that I have given him to hand to you will explain further.
 Halruaa appears to have visitors who have shown more than a students interest in the academy’s affairs. Having come this far I am not about to leave anything to chance... it shouldn’t take me long to find and deal with these *inquisitive students*.
 In the meantime, I ask that as well as Garron, you also instruct Sebastian in use of the leveller. It would be good to have two persons capable of deploying it in case one or the other becomes incapacitated in any way, and as this is your project, who better than yourself to instruct them. 
 Call me over cautious if you want but I have changed the ward on the door to the room in the sewers, just in case we have been infiltrated by Ulcaster spies. I doubt spies would have cause to go down into the sewers but I still prefer to err on the side of caution. The second letter that he will give to you explains how you may open the door to the leveller. 
 If I don’t see you before you leave for Ulcaster, let me wish you luck and I will see you when you return victorious.

Jhadros lived a contented life among the nomadic tribes of the High Desert in The Land Of Fate... that was until Fate took a hand and his sweetheart Sikayah, caught the eye of the Grand Caliph of the city of Huzuz known as *The City of Delights*. Sikayah was secreted away into the Caliph’s palace, where she was to learn the ways of life in the harem and become the old Caliph’s new wife.

Knowing that he had very little time to save Sikaya from the marriage, Jhadros travelled to the north western city of Quadib, a magical city and home to mages, sorcerers, genies and the like. There he sought out the elemental wind mage Zarad, who after one year service, fashioned this cloak for Jhadros, imbuing it with powerful magical properties.

Jhadros returned to Huzuz armed with his magical cloak and the powerful wind spells that Zarad had taught him, he entered The Great Palace on a magical Wind Carpet and whisked Sikaya away. Knowing that honour would warrant their deaths, Jhadros and his sweetheart fled  Zakhara. It isn’t known to where the lovers fled, nor their manner of escape. Some say Jhadros secured passage for them aboard a merchant ship, whilst others say they escaped aboard one of the spelljammer vessels that had been seen docked at Huzuz.

@715  = ~Sunscorch (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 4
Range: 5 yards/level
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

A narrow beam of intense light slants down from above, as the wizard completes the incantation of this spell. The target suffers 6D4 points of heat damage, which is doubled if the target is undead or fungoid. The victim is also blinded for 1D4 rounds unless a saving throw versus spells is successful. There is no saving throw against the damage itself.~
@716  = ~Summon Wind Dragons~
@717  = ~Summon Wind Dragons (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yards/level
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area Effect: 1D10 whirlwinds
Saving Throw: None

Despite its name, this spell does not summon dragons; rather 1D10 small whirlwind-like air elementals are conjured. A wind dragon attacks with a THAC0 of 6, has a base AC of 0, may attack once per round, and inflicts 4D4 points of damage. Any creature struck by a wind dragon will become disoriented, thus may not cast any spells in the following round.~
@718  = ~Wind Dragon~

@720  = ~Shadow Bolt (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

By means of this spell, the caster brings into being a semi-real phantasm of an onrushing missile. The large, red globe-shaped illusionary projectile glows with a faerie-like radiance; it appears behind the caster and rushes at any one creature the caster concentrates upon (the caster must be able to see the target as the spell is cast).

A shadow bolt is otherwise affected only by magical barriers, not by spells or physical attacks. It inflicts 1D8 damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster. If disbelieved (the target creature makes a successful saving throw versus spells), a bolt inflicts only 1/2 damage. The strike of a shadow bolt is a considerable blow; the victim must make a strength check to avoid falling, and a successful dexterity check is required to protect exposed fragile items, otherwise, these must make saving throws vs. crushing blow to escape damage from the character‘s fall.~
@721  = ~Shatter Bones~
@722  = ~Shatter Bones (Necromancy)
Level: 6
Range: 50 yards
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area Effect: 20 yard radius
Saving Throw: None

When cast, shatter bones causes weakness in all creatures with bodies comprising of bones, including undead. This spell has no effect on creatures with incorporeal bodies, as well as creatures with elemental or metallic bodies. The effects of this spell spread outwards to a 20 yard radius. All creatures falling within the area effect of the spell suffer a -3 AC penalty, as well as a -3 penalty to attack rolls. Movement rate is halved, and affected creatures suffer 1D6 points of damage per round for the duration of this spell or until dispelled.~
@723  = ~Dweomer Warp~
@724  = ~Dweomer Warp (Alteration)
Level: 7
Range: 5 yards/2 levels
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This insidious spell is effective against enemy spellcasters, depending on their type and level. A green ray is sent towards the target of the wizard‘s choice, enveloping the spellcaster in a field of ravaging weave-fire. Arcane magic users, wizards, bards, and sorcerers suffer 1D4 points of magic damage for half the number of levels they have. Divine magic users, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers suffer 1D2 points of magic damage for half the number of levels they have. Warriors and other monsters that use magic as innate abilities are unaffected. Multi-/dual-class characters may suffer 1D6 points of magic damage if they are of both wizard and priest class.~

@726  = ~Morgannaver‘s Stinger (Necromancy)
Level: 5
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/until touched
Casting Time: 5
Area Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell enables the caster to drain 3d4 hit points from any single creature and absorb them as healing energy. The caster  has three rounds after casting to touch another creature (a successful attack roll is required), or the spell is lost.

The first creature touched is affected, regardless of the caster‘s intentions. The affected creature must make a saving throw versus spells at a -2 penalty. If successful, the creature loses 1D6+1 hit points, and the caster gains no hit points. If the saving throw fails, the caster gains 3D4 hit points drained from the creature as healing energy. Morgannaver‘s sting does not confer hit points above the caster‘s normal total; excess hit points drained by the caster are lost.

The drained creature, if not killed, is wracked by intense pain for 3 rounds, suffering an Armor Class penalty of -2 and a -2 penalty to attack rolls during this time. The afflicted  creature can not cast spells nor perform other activities that require concentration. Hit points lost to this spell can be regained by the usual means of magical healing, rest, etc.~
@727  = ~Vashon‘s Shadow Bolt (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

By means of this spell, the caster brings into being a semi-real phantasm of an onrushing missile. The large, red globe-shaped illusionary projectile glows with a faerie-like radiance; it appears behind the caster and rushes at any one creature the caster concentrates upon (the caster must be able to see the target as the spell is cast).

A shadow bolt is otherwise affected only by magical barriers, not by spells or physical attacks. It inflicts 1D8 damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster. If disbelieved (the target creature makes a successful saving throw versus spells), a bolt inflicts only 1/2 damage. The strike of a shadow bolt is a considerable blow; the victim must make a strength check to avoid falling, and a successful dexterity check is required to protect exposed fragile items, otherwise, these must make saving throws vs. crushing blow to escape damage from the character‘s fall.~
@728  = ~Summon Wind Dragons (Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 6
Range: 10 yards/level
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area Effect: 1D10 whirlwinds
Saving Throw: None

Despite its name, this spell does not summon dragons; rather 1D10 small whirlwind-like air elementals are conjured. A wind dragon attacks as a 5 Hit Dice creature (with a THAC0 of 16), has a base AC of 0, may attack once per round, and inflicts 4D4 points of damage. Any creature struck by a wind dragon will become disoriented, thus may not cast any spells in the following round.~

Level 5
Range: 20 yards
Duration: 1 round/level of caster
Casting Time: 6
Area of effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

An *Eye Bite* spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:

Fear: The victim flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds, after which the creature will cower or bolt for cower if confronted by the caster for 1 round/level of caster. This effect can be negated by spells that counter fear.

Charm: This effect makes the victim loyal to the caster even to the point of personal damage, otherwise it is the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demi-humans, and humanoid save with a +2 bonus.

Sicken: This effect causes sudden pain and fever to sweep over the victims body. Creatures with ability scores function at one-half effectiveness, others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. All movement rate is halved. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster and can only be negated by a Remove Curse or a Dispel Magic spell. Abilities return at the rate or 1 point/round of complete rest. Creatures save same as the charm effect.

Sleep: This effect causes an individual to fall into a comatose slumber unless a successful save vs. spells is made. Creatures normally subject to a first level Sleep spell save with a -2 penalty. An effected creature must be shaken or shocked back to consciousness. Undead are immune to this effect.

Xan has modified the original Eye Bite spell to enhance it in a way that it becomes available for memorization by his students and lower level enchanters.~

An *Eye Bite* spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. For example, a 12th-level caster who chose fear would have four opportunities to make successful  gaze attacks causing fear, one for each round of the spell’s duration. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:

Fear: The victim flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds, after which the creature will cower or bolt for cower if confronted by the caster for 1 round/level of caster. This effect can be negated by spells that counter fear.

Level: 7

Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negative

A *Mass Charm* spell forces all creatures not allied with the caster in the area of effect to succeed at a saving throw versus spells or be charmed as if affected by the 3th level spell *Dire Charm*. Targeted creatures must be within spell range which is 20 yards + 5 yards per level of castser. Targeted creatures are subject to a negative penalty on their saving throws because of the efficiency of this spell. Any wisdom bonus against charm spells does not apply.

Undead are unaffected by this spell.~
@739  = ~Dominant (Enhanced by Xan)~
@740  = ~Properly a hat, not a helm, the Dominant is a wizardly item of impressive power.  The wizard Bemban of Immersea was known to be quite fond of these pointed hats both for their appearance and their power.  Many wizards sought their own Dominants, but their distinctive appearance soon became the butt of many jokes among adventurers.  Bemban grew senile in his later years, and left most of his fortune to private mages in the hope that they would continue to make his favorite magical hat.

When the wizard casts this spell, a narrow beam of intense heat erupts from his hands which moves towards its target, and as unerring as a Magic Missile spell. The target suffers 1d4+1 points of damage from each thermal charge, plus an additional 1d6 fire damage. The wizard gains an additional set of thermal charges for every three extra levels of experience above 10th. Victims failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from fire, but those rolling successful saving throws manage to dodge for half.~

Mordecai suceeded to modify and adapt the basic fifth level spell Insect Plague cast by priests and druids for mages in a way it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time for 3 rounds + 1 round per level of the caster. This spell summons a horde of insects composed of various small beetles, spiders and other creatures. The swarm is capable of dealing devastating damage in a short period of time but is in turn fragile and easily killed. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible.

Saving Throw: None 

Although being the master of illusions, Vashon has succesfully studied in the school of transmutation, and then experimented with alteration magic for a long time. His combined studies in both fields resulted in enhancing the famous Dimension Door spell in a way that the caster is able to teleport himself to any reachable, arbitrary chosen point within the same area even if it‘s not within the visual range of the caster. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which he immediately steps through. Upon passing through the portal, the caster finds himself at his chosen destination.

Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc.

When Accalia casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground completely covering her. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder her in no way. The effect of this is to protect the caster from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. The skins will remain until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect Accalia from any area attacks such as fireball, however it will protect her from physical magical attacks such as magic missile.~

He may be on an army’s side on one day and against them the next. Such is the nature of war as embodied by Tempus.

The dress of the priest of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered. In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Priests of Tempus may be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know who the war god will favor.

Abilities:

- ‘Spiritual Hammer‘ (thrice per day), the magic weapon without non-proficiency penalties strikes with a bonus of +2 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +6 enchantment level, +6 to the attack roll and +6 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster, the base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is 2d4 + 3 vs. opponents plus the magical bonus.
- ‘Tempus Will‘ (twice per day) imbues the caster with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level, so the priest’s strength is set to 18/00, even if it is normally higher, his THAC0 becomes that of a fighter of the same level, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained.
- ‘Tempus Shield‘ (twice per day) creates an invisible rotating through a 180 degree arc disk that protects the caster in a way that any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction.
- ‘Iron Skin‘ (once a day), the magical outer skin of iron moves up from the ground completely covering Accalia without hindering her in any way, protecting from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. Accalia gains an additional skin for every two levels, and for each skin she possesses, the spell will stop one attack.
- ‘False Dawn‘(thrice per day) calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, affecting all undead creatures within the area of effect so they suffer 6d6 points of damage and act confused on the round with no saving throw against this damage.
-  Can only be of True Neutral, or any Chaotic alignments.~

She tells you of her duties to assist Everard in the armoury and in the performing of rituals. Accalia is happy to tell you of any of these rituals and local battle lore, but when you ask her to tell of the battle of Gerard‘s Stone, she will tell you to ask Everard as he prefers to tell of it himself. Accalia will say that she is content to do the will of Tempus in the temple but would much prefer to be on the front line, protecting the *immigrants*, (a term Accalia uses when she refers to herself and the townsfolk of Easthaven), from the spontaneous attacks from the many barbarian tribes in the area.~

The illegitimate daughter of a mage and a hafling servant girl, Melora’s first years were hapless. Despised by a father that regarded as an “accident” and who treated her like some lesser being, Melora did not even have the comfort of a mother’s love. She too cast Melora aside when she made a wealthy marriage for herself. So perhaps her hatred is justified, or so Melora would have you believe. The young maiden swore to herself that she would ever be on the side of the oppressed. She has become somewhat of a hero to the poorer people on the outskirts of Candlekeep for her generosity with rich men’s money, none of which she keeps for herself.

Finally, he magically enhanced the weapons to serve only their owner, and granted them to his most trusted friend. Adlonn became a normal thief then, away from his guild. No one knew where he‘d gone. Occasional tales in taverns tell that he‘s still doing what he did, steal from the rich and help the poor.

When Tamjuhk was sacked by efreeti, githyanki, salamanders, and other malicious creatures, the efreeti Amir Talmed presented the weapon to the Grand Sultan of the city of Brass. Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

Upon browsing the first part of the book, you reveal that it is essentially a collection of ethical teachings. The teachings are applicable to all conditions of life: to parents and children, to husbands and wives, to the young, to masters, to friends, to the rich, and to the poor.

Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, the wizard brings into being a shimmering, swordlike plane of force that leaps into the wizards hands.  The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects, as well it inflicts 5-20 damage when a successful attack is made in combat.  Once the spell is cast the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster.  Note that this does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell duration.~

Improved Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 4
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character‘s saving throws are made with a +4 bonus. 

Note: after making an attack the caster is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the mage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell allows a mage to store spells in a magical ability (accessed via the special ability button) that is created by the spell.  This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower.

Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the elemental plane of Air.  This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death.  The creature remains under the caster‘s control for 9 hours or until it is killed -- at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.~

Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 2
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

Finger of Death (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 Creature
Saving Throw: Neg

The finger of death spell snuffs out the victim‘s life force.  The caster points his finger at the victim after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of his body unless a save vs. spells is made at -2.  A creature that successfully saves still receives 2d8 +1 points of damage.~

Chromatic Orb 
(Evocation) 
Level: 1
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: special 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster‘s hand.  When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target.  The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the mage who casts the spell.  Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. spells at +6.  At first-level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and blinds the target for one round.  At second-level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and inflicts pain upon the victim.  At third-level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and burns the victim.  At fourth-level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and blinds the target for 1 turn.  At fifth-level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.  At sixth-level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and causes weakness in the victim.  At seventh level, the sphere deals 1-10 damage and paralyzes the victim for 2 turns.  At 10th level, the sphere causes 1-12 acid damage and turns the victim to stone.  At 12th level, the sphere will inflict 2-16 points of acid damage and instantly kill the victim.  
NOTE: The victim saves vs spells at +6 against all the effects and gets no save against the damage.~

@935  = ~Taffic‘s Reckless Dweomer~
@936  = ~Taffic‘s Reckless Dweomer (Invocation/Evocation) 
Level: 1
Range: Special
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the wild mage‘s ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the wild mage tries to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (found in your manual).

Because the release of energy is planned by the mage, his level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result may be beneficial to the mage or it may be completely disastrous; this is the risk the mage takes in casting his reckless dweomer.~
@937  = ~Taffic‘s Chaos Shield~
@938  = ~Taffic‘s Chaos Shield (Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds + 10 rounds / 5 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None

Chaos Shield increases a wild mage‘s chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the dice roll.  When Taffic casts his Reckless Dweomer, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with his mage‘s level bonus.~
@939  = ~Taffic~
@963  = ~Taffic was born into a clan of prolific forest gnomes living in Cloakwood Forest. Your first impression of Taffic is that he is as he seems, a happy-go-lucky forest gnome with small eyes that have a hint of mischief about them. Taffic will tell you of his dream to become a tall hero, not too strange a dream for a gnome you think, but when Taffic speaks of his dream it soon becomes apparent that this dream of his has become an obsession with him and no longer a dream. On looking closer you see a very distraught and unhappy gnome. More frightening is the realisation that Taffic will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Taffic tells you of the past 15 years that he has spent (not many years given the length of a gnome’s lifespan), following every rumour that reaches his large gnomish ears, of the artifacts he has sought and tried, of the potions and spells that he has experimented with, of the prayers he has offered to his god and even of the combinations of all of these things together. “A lot of wasted time and energy” he will say, “ but now, yes now at last I know how to do it” and Taffic’s voice takes on an excitable tone, a glint comes to his eye and the seemingly harmless gnome suddenly makes you afraid of what he has in mind.~
@964  = ~Garp’s Stave of Swarming Insects~
@965  = ~Covered almost entirely with finely carved images of all manner of insects, this stout stave was fashioned for the gnome illusionist Garp Van Vechten... hence it is somewhat shorter in length than the normal stave. Garp adventured for many years with his human druid friend Diederik. Together they fought and won many battles. Garp, although a brilliant illusionist was himself wary when confronting other magic users in battle. He knew only too well the advantage a mage, well stocked with high level destructive magic had over him, but with the help of one particular spell that his friend always kept in reserve for such encounters... the druid spell of *Insect Plague... Garp very quickly lost his fear of  magic users and their spells. Once cast, Garp would watch gleefully as their opponents writhed in agony, their spells lost due to the scratching, biting and stinging of the plague, allowing his own magic to quickly take them down. Unfortunately a human is not blessed with the long lifespan of a gnome so before he died, Diederik enchanted this staff for his friend, giving it the ability to cast the spell he hoped would aid him against magic users when he no longer could. It is thought to be the only one of its kind in existence to date.

	        I am sorry I can not be here for your visit but I have left this letter with Carialie. Regards your question of the possibility of altering a person’s race, I know of only one person wise enough to have the answer that you seek. He and I travelled extensively together in our youth and before that he had seen many wonders that I could only dream of. 
                  I recall a story he once told me that he and another were witness to. A story of a young dwarf who was unfortunate enough to fall in love with an eleven girl. This dwarf  sought far and wide for the knowledge to make himself of the elven race, and it just so happens he happened upon the sorcerer Aldruis at the same time that my friend was visiting the sorcerer himself. If the story is true, and I have no reason to doubt the word of my friend, that young dwarf left Aldruis’s abode a young sprightly elven male. 
                This friend of mine is none other than the conjurer Thalantyr, and he can be found living on the outskirts of Beregost. I can not guarantee that he will impart any of his knowledge to your gnome friend as he has become somewhat of a recluse of late and is very particular with whom he converses... some might even call him arrogant. 
                I hope this is of some use to you and please Deidre, don’t leave it so long next time between visits. Carialie and myself always look forward to and enjoy having you stay with us.

                                             Your affectionate friend
                                                              Leanaro.~

This causes a burning sensation throughout their whole body which never quite abates, but in return, they gain some of the balor's powers. Only the most evil of the creatures would use it.~

I was prepared to search later on this evening, but a group of ettins have encamped in the passage north of where I am now, and I am in no condition to be running past them. Hopefully I will get another opportunity to search the old meeting hall of the dwarves. Earlier I uncovered some writings regarding a room within these walls that leads to the lower segments of this complex, and I can only assume that this room lies behind the door I have yet to find.  To make matters worse, the same writings inferred that this room contained a puzzle that was designed to keep the invaders from discovering and desecrating the Cemetery and Forge. Perhaps Bandoth can provide some more assistance.~

As you know by now, your master and creator is gone.  Malavon, Saablic's associate, will now be handling all magical affairs in the dome north of the Artisan's District.  You are the strongest of your kind, and thus it is to you that I extend Saablic's badge of lieutenancy.  Use it as a symbol of the authority that I have loaned to you.  If ever you and the others need to have audience with me, you must bring your badge with you.  Think of it as a key -- one of six keys to a lock.  Do not lose it.

I am placing you and the other orogs in charge of defending the upper reaches of Dorn's Deep.  It is your new home.  Do with it what you wish, but always submit to my will and to the will of Ilmater.  Your nearest peer is Kreg Frostbeard in Wyrm's Tooth.  If you are in need of assistance, call upon him and his kin for aid.  Defend the stronghold with your lives, for if you survive in failure, your suffering will be monumental.

If you have trouble understanding any portion of this letter, have Adinirahc or one of the other drow mercenaries explain it to you.

In the Blood of Our Father,

@1003 = ~Cairn Blade~
@1004 = ~Named for its ability to lay warriors and warlords low, the Cairn Blade was used by the mercenary Adal Kerrn.  Kerrn was a skilled heavy infantryman.  He and his company, Kerrn's Breakers, hired themselves out to all sorts of warlords, bandits, wizards, and religious leaders.  They were typically placed at the front of the battlefield where they would intercept charging heavy cavalry units and break their formation.  Kerrn died in 1054 DR when he accidentally killed the horse of a heavily armored foe.  The horse fell on top of Kerrn, killing him.  In the madness of the battle that followed, most of his comrades were routed.  Though Kerrn's body was never found, the group that had employed him at the time, the church of Helm, recovered his distinctive sword.

This portion of the Deep has been a pleasant surprise, to say the least.  Not only do the ancient dwarven deterrents provide me much seclusion for my work, I have gained the ability to have their spirits become my unwilling servants in knowledge.  Soon I will begin my final transcendence, and my ascended existence within this region will ensure that my power is without challenge.  My new minions, unable to ever find their peace as long as my thoughts occupy what is left of their minds.


Morning Twenty-Three

A curious experience today.  I finally managed to open the door to Jamoth‘s tomb, and upon entering I was overcome with fatigue.  At first I felt as though I may have unintentionally sprung a trap, but upon revisiting the tomb later I discounted that possibility.  I felt as though life itself was leaving my body, and twisting my coherence.  I will need to investigate this room further in the future, and exercise caution.  I feel as though there may be something within those chambers that would challenge my occupation of these halls.


Morning Twenty-Six

I have given up attempting to open the door to Wyrm‘s Tooth.  I‘d hoped to have visited the area to gather some necessities for my rite of passage, but it appears to be impossible to move the door in any way without its key.  I know from my readings of the lore scattered about here that the key was placed in or around the dwarven monument outside of the cemetery, but its hiding place appears to be impossible to find in the forge‘s current state.  I‘m afraid that without certain resources, the process will render me weaker than I‘d originally intended, but I appear to have no choice but to use what I have.~
@1025 = ~Journal of Evayne~
@1026 = ~ The last few weeks have been a blur but I will recount as best as I can. 


  Arriving at Dorn‘s Deep in the middle of the night did not lead to a warm welcome by the dwarves, especially with what had come to past between both our races.  As expected, the dwarves were very apprehensive to what I had to say.  There were too many fresh and open wounds between both our people.  Situations like this are never easy but I consider myself as good a diplomat as father, perhaps better.   

  Each day spent in council did not end until late evening and always in pure exhaustion.  We argued and bickered over the recent past events.  Although we still continued to spend countless hours in council, the dwarves began to trust that I hid no maliciousness behind my words.  The dwarves agreed to a treaty in the name of the greater good for both our races later that week.  I had been successful in my part.  I saw hope for the first time in many months.  

  The only thing left was to return home and convince my own people that this was our only chance at true salvation.  The hardest part would be to convince father but he will listen.  He must listen; else let our people face death.

  The next morning almost made the last few weeks‘ work in vain.  A dwarven scout arrived and told of the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away.  With little time to prepare, our defenses were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn‘s Deep. 

  We began our retreat into the depths of Dorn‘s Deep.   Key passages were collapsed to cover our movements and buy us time.  Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where we would fight.  Every battle cost the orcs dearly as the dwarves fought on their terms but we were still being driven farther and farther back.  Even now, we make preparations to retreat further into Wyrm‘s Tooth Glacier.

  Even as grim as this sounds, I still hold hope.  Hope that I will tell father of how I fought side by side with our dwarven friends as in days of old.  Hope that he will hear the tales of the dwarves who sacrificed their lives so that I may return home someday to reunite both our people.  Hope to see my father‘s stubborn face once again.


For my people and the Seldarine‘s Hand,

Evayne~
@1027 = ~Mail of Life~
@1028 = ~This armor was crafted from meteoric iron by dwarven and elven smiths during the Time of Cooperation.  A high priest of Moradin and a high priest of Labelas Enoreth enchanted the armor with its powers.  It is so finely wrought and light that it can be worn by thieves and fighter/mages with few restrictions.  Unfortunately, no elven or dwarven warrior ever wore the chain mail.  When troubles arose between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn‘s Deep, the dwarves locked the armor in a vault, refusing to use anything the elves had a hand in creating.

Beldan employed the helm frequently, as Iraeni was often attacked by agents of Myrkul.  After twenty years of serving Lathander, Iraeni decided to step down from her office, as did Beldan.  They were married shortly after.  Beldan gave the helm to an errant paladin of Lathander, who is believed to have died fighting a lich near the Battle of the Bones.

His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them.  Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards.  His robes are his most well known legacy.

@1117 = ~Potion of Negative Plane Protection~
@1118 = ~This dark and viscous elixir imbues the drinker with partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. It acts like the spell Negative Plane Protection when consumed creating a channel to the Positive Energy plane, possibly offsetting the effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. The protected creature suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience. This potion is useless on the Negative Energy plane. The effect will last for 10 rounds or until dispelled.

@1122 = ~Hammer of Comminution

Research reveals that this is a formidable weapon indeed. Far superior to a normal sledgehammer, this warhammer (also called the "Hammer of Comminution") delivers a devastating strike that not only inflicts crushing damage, but also fractures any surface it contacts, whether bone, metal, or wood, inflicting extra damage... and if the victim survives, it also softens him up for the next attack. The Hammer of Comminution was used extensively by Enote, a Doomguard priest, in 14E.U. A philosopher, and a member of the Doomguard faction in Sigil, who was prone to violent mood swings while debating theology, he was known to espouse the virtues of the hammer as a means of furthering the decay of dead matter. Whether of not what he struck with the hammer was dead or alive before the blow is open to debate.

Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness.  Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safe-keeping.  The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear.  Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest.  His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned.  All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched or tried to escape.  In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

@1204 = ~The Salamander's Tongue~
@1205 = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers.  The blade appears to be an exotic looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points.  A small portion of a slimy, bright red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip.  It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner.  

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill.  Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers.  Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound.  Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination.  Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam, and was killed by Deder's agents within the month.  Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it.  He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate.  The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside.  Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar.  Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an Amulet of Non-Detection.  The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen.  Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia.  The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead.  This priest, called "The Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased.  Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across.  He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed.  The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe.  Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights.  He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear.  With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

@1226 = ~This sword was made with one purpose: to destroy evil. Though a powerful weapon, Pale Justice has humble beginnings. The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold. Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade.

As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr. The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar. He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power.

The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it. After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence.

Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr. Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade. It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.

The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses. Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time. He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago. The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword.

The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls. Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso. The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke: "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods. Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison."

Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon. The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon. He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.

"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power. I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility. Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant. It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."

Edan took the blade to a local weapon smith and had him put a wooden, leather wrapped grip on it. He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

Algrash was killed when he provoked a fight with a gang of ogres.  His boots were left at the scene of the battle.

The gnomes of the Dorn's Deep further enhanted these boots to fit the wizards granting additional protection in combat and on the road.

Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by Maiden Ilmadia.

@1267 = ~Alamion~
@1268 = ~This long sword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion.  Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical long sword blade and features a thin fuller down the center.  Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated towards the hilt.  The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two off-white pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow.  The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire.  The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.

The full history of this blade and its brother have been well documented.  Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril.  Obren reluctantly did so, producing Alamion ("Frost Daddy") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five year period.  After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force.  The exact outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful.  Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons in a single strike.  Berdino was found dead on the shore two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.

The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair.  Pellas had acquired Malamion, quite by accident, fourteen years earlier and strongly desired its brother when he learned of its existence.  Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of a paladin named Garijon Renold of Torm.  Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes and the two swords were passed on for generations from paladin to paladin.

Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords.  His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.

It protected its bearers on numerous occasions.  The envoys of the Queen of the Sea rarely abused the powers of the device, but it only took one mischievous priest to lose the item.  Legends say that Herren of Umberlee used the shield's sanctuary to attack and destroy a number of elementals before the water lord Ishtishia shifted the priest to the paraelemental plane of ice, where he froze to death.  From there, it is believed that the shield floated around the planes for many years, only recently resurfacing in Faerun.
