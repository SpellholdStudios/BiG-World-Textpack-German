@0    = ~By Tempos!  The vision speaks true.  You *are* the heroes from my dreams.~ [HJOLL001]
@1    = ~Do I know you?~
@2    = ~What are you talking about?~
@3    = ~You must have us confused with some other heroes.  Farewell.~
@4    = ~Our paths have not crossed until this day.  I am Hjollder[Yole-dare], son to Hrethric[Reth-rick], elder and shaman to the Tribe of the Bear.~ [HJOLL002]
@5    = ~Well met, Hjollder.  What's this business about dreams and visions?~
@6    = ~What's a tribesman doing here in Kuldahar?~
@7    = ~What's a tribesman doing here in Lonelywood?~
@8    = ~Shaman, eh?  That explains all this nonsense about visions.~
@9    = ~The vision is why I have come to this place.  Tempos has guided me to you.~ [HJOLL003]
@10   = ~For what purpose?~
@11   = ~If your god has guided you to us, then your need must be great indeed.~
@12   = ~Well you found us... now Tempos can guide you elsewhere.  Farewell.~
@13   = ~This I cannot say.  I know only that the storm of war darkens the skies of my homeland.  My people are gathering in numbers greater than any have seen for generations.  ~ [HJOLL004]
@14   = ~A king, both new and old, has risen to lead the tribes against the Ten-Towns.  Already the first snows of winter bear the dark stains of spilt blood.~ [HJOLL005]
@15   = ~I don't see what any of this has to do with us.~
@16   = ~Tell me more of this new *and* old king.~
@17   = ~Speak plainly.  What do you want from us?~
@18   = ~You must understand.  I have read the signs.  Tempos will not favor either side in the coming battles.  Both my people and those of the towns shall be haunted by countless deaths without honor.~ [HJOLL006]
@19   = ~I have cast my spirit into the nether realm in search of a way to prevent what must not be.  My vision quest led me here to find you.  *You* are the answer I seek.~ [HJOLL007]
@20   = ~I see.  So what can we do to help?~
@21   = ~Tell me again of this new *and* old king.~
@22   = ~Sorry to disappoint you, but we have other plans.  Farewell.~
@23   = ~You must come to Hengorot[hen-gore-oh]... to the great Mead Hall where the tribes have gathered.  You alone can forestall the war between our peoples.~ [HJOLL008]
@24   = ~Very well.  We shall accompany you.~
@25   = ~Today we arrived at last in the town of Lonelywood.  We had hardly caught sight of the outlying buildings when we were approached by a large man clad in deerskins.  He introduced himself as Hjollder, shaman to the Tribe of the Bear.  He went on to explain that his people were on the brink of war with the Ten-Towns, and that visions had led him to believe that we could somehow prevent the conflict.  In any case, we agreed to accompany the shaman and aid him in any way we can.~
@26   = ~We met some sort of barbarian shaman sheltering in one of the abandoned buildings in Kuldahar.  He introduced himself as Hjollder, shaman to the Tribe of the Bear.  He went on to explain that his people were on the brink of war with the Ten-Towns, and that visions had led him to believe that we could somehow prevent the conflict.  In any case, we agreed to accompany the shaman and aid him in any way we can.~
@27   = ~Maybe some other time.  Farewell.~
@28   = ~Yes.  The storm of war darkens the skies of my homeland.  My people are gathering in numbers greater than any have seen for generations.  ~ [HJOLL009]
@29   = ~Wylfdene[Wilf-dane] is his name.  He was a great warrior from an elder tribe who was slain in battle on the eve of last season.~ [HJOLL010]
@30   = ~Now his body has returned from death's halls to lead my people once more... as king.  ~ [HJOLL011]
@31   = ~He came back from the grave?  What kind of undead monster is this king of yours?~
@32   = ~Interesting... but I don't see what any of this has to do with us.~
@33   = ~I've heard enough.  Go spin your yarns at the tavern if you like... we've got better things to do.~
@34   = ~Wylfdene's flesh is but a vessel, a borrowed tool.  The spirit of the new king is much, much older than the form it now inhabits.~ [HJOLL012]
@35   = ~It is said that the spirit of Jerrod governs his body.  It is this claim that has fueled the fires of vengeance among my people.~ [HJOLL013]
@36   = ~Jerrod?  Isn't he the barbarian hero entombed beneath the temple in Easthaven?~
@37   = ~Jerrod?  Who is he?~
@38   = ~Jerrod?  Isn't he the barbarian hero who was entombed beneath the temple in Easthaven?~
@39   = ~Sounds like a problem... but not *our* problem.~
@40   = ~[surprised]The same.  You know our history well.  ~ [HJOLL014]
@41   = ~Jerrod was our greatest hero.  Centuries ago, he united the tribes and led us to victory against invaders from the south.~ [HJOLL015]
@42   = ~He died on the battlefield in the embrace of infernal magicks, bravely sacrificing his life to save his people.~ [HJOLL016]
@43   = ~Now, after centuries of imprisonment, Jerrod's spirit is free and rallies the tribes once more in a common cause.~ [HJOLL017]
@44   = ~If this Jerrod was such a great hero, surely his cause must be just.  So why are you here?~
@45   = ~The ghost of one of your ancestors is leading your people to war?  Forgive me if I don't believe you.~
@46   = ~Wait... I beg you.  I have risked much to find you.  I am certain the vision spoke true.  Only *you* can help my people.~ [HJOLL018]
@47   = ~You say a vision led you to us?  For what purpose?~
@48   = ~What makes you think we can do anything to help your people?~
@49   = ~We met some sort of barbarian shaman sheltering in one of the abandoned buildings in Kuldahar.  He kept harping on about visions and such, pleading with us to help him and his people.  Perhaps the poor fellow had been out in the snow for too long.  In any case, we gave him the brush off and left him in peace.~
@50   = ~Though we journey towards the same destination, our paths are not one.  My place is at the side of my king.  Already I have been gone too long.~ [HJOLL019]
@51   = ~From here, you must go alone.  The people of this town will know the way to the camp of my people.~ [HJOLL020]
@52   = ~Travel swiftly and safely.  We shall meet again when you stand before the council in the great Mead Hall.~ [HJOLL021]
@53   = ~Before parting company, Hjollder instructed us to travel alone to the Great Mead Hall.  Once there, we must go before the council of his people and sue for peace.  He said the people of Lonelywood should know the way to the barbarian camp.~
@54   = ~I am honored by your choice.  The journey is a long one, and our quest is urgent.  I shall summon the wind to carry us through the mountains and over the tundra.~ [HJOLL022]
@55   = ~Know this... should you wish to return to this place, it is within my power to bring you back.  But walking upon the wind taxes one's spirit greatly.  ~ [HJOLL023]
@56   = ~It may be days before I can make the journey again.  Now... are you prepared to depart?~ [HJOLL024]
@57   = ~Yes.  Let us be off.~
@58   = ~Not yet.  We have some unfinished business to attend to first.~
@59   = ~Very well.  I shall remain here until you return.  Mark well the passage of time.  The storm draws closer with each passing moment.~ [HJOLL025]
@60   = ~Farewell.~
@61   = ~You have returned.  Again it is as the vision foretold.~ [HJOLL026]
@62   = ~What is this vision you keep harping on about?~
@63   = ~What is it with you and this vision?  What do you want from us?~
@64   = ~Right.  We must be going now.  Farewell.~
@65   = ~We are ready to accompany you now.  Let us be off.~
@66   = ~Sorry.  We are still not ready to leave just yet.~
@67   = ~We have arrived outside the settlement your people call Lonelywood.  Of the Ten-Towns, it is the nearest to my people's homeland and will no doubt fall first if my people heed Wylfdene's call to war.~ [HJOLL027]
@68   = ~Now I must leave you, for I am not welcome among the homes of these southerners.~ [HJOLL028]
@69   = ~You're leaving?  I thought you were supposed to take us to this Mead Hall of yours.~
@70   = ~Stay your hand, mighty Wylfdene.  These strangers bear our people no malice - upon my oath.~ [HJOLL029]
@71   = ~I know this, for it was I who bade them to appear before this council.~ [HJOLL030]
@72   = ~Their coming was foretold by a vision.  I have been to the other side, great king.  The spirits have shown me these heroes and other images that speak the will of Tempos.~ [HJOLL031]
@73   = ~If Tempos has called these strangers to us, then surely we cannot dishonor ourselves by slaying them within the hallowed halls of Hengorot.~ [HJOLL032]
@74   = ~I... I do not know.  The vision was unclear as to what purpose they must serve, but it must-~ [HJOLL033]
@75   = ~What's this?  More spirits come to torment my treasonous heart?  Be gone, vengeful ghosts!  Allow me to endure my shame in peace.~ [HJOLL034]
@76   = ~We're no ghosts, Hjollder.  We're flesh and blood like you.~
@77   = ~As you wish.  Farewell.~
@78   = ~How can this be?  Wylfdene expelled you from the camp.  Your quest was over before it began.  Why have you come to this place?~ [HJOLL035]
@79   = ~We've come to rescue you.~
@80   = ~Wylfdene did more than just expel us... he tried to have us killed!~
@81   = ~That's right... our quest is over.  We'd like to return to Kuldahar now.~
@82   = ~Rescue me?  You do not understand.  There shall be no rescue for me... only redemption found in death's embrace.  I belong here and shall remain until my spirit has been cleansed for the crossing.~ [HJOLL036]
@83   = ~Are you saying you've decided to just give up and die here?~
@84   = ~Look, we've come a long way to find you.  We're not about to just give up and go home.~
@85   = ~So be it.  Farewell, Hjollder.~
@86   = ~My fate has been decreed by Wylfdene.  An honest man accepts all judgments of his chosen king.~ [HJOLL037]
@87   = ~What if we were to tell you Wylfdene isn't who he claims to be?~
@88   = ~You are indeed honest, but my faith has allowed me to see into the heart of your king.  The touch of evil is upon him.~
@89   = ~There must be something we can do.~
@90   = ~What?  The king is false?  How is this known to you?~ [HJOLL038]
@91   = ~We have spoken with the spirits of this island.  They have told us that the spirit that inhabits Wylfdene's body is corrupted by evil.~
@92   = ~Yes... I see.  It is this corruption that has placed the spirits in turmoil.  These visions I have had of late are the manifestations of their anguish.~ [HJOLL039]
@93   = ~However, I fear I have risked too much already based upon the word of spirits.  If I am to act against my king, I must have proof.~ [HJOLL040]
@94   = ~Where can we find such proof?~
@95   = ~If the soul that inhabits Wylfdene's body is indeed corrupt, then perhaps it may have left signs of its passing within the tomb of the dead king.~ [HJOLL041]
@96   = ~Seek your proof within the barrows of this island.  Should you discover anything of importance, return it here to me and we shall discuss our quest further.~ [HJOLL042]
@97   = ~We found this amulet within Wylfdene's tomb.  It appears to have been intentionally defaced.~
@98   = ~We gave Hjollder the amulet we found in Wylfdene's tomb.  The defaced insignia coupled with the desecration of the tomb was proof enough to convince the shaman that the spirit inhabiting Wylfdene's body could not possibly be that of the barbarian hero, Jerrod.~
@99   = ~Very well.  Farewell for now, Hjollder.~
@100  = ~We spoke with Hjollder and told him what we had learned from the restless spirits of the Burial Isle.  Although he seemed convinced, he demanded we acquire further proof.  He suggested that we search the barrows for some tangible evidence of Wylfdene's corruption.~
@101  = ~Please... try not to judge my people so harshly.  It was my foolishness that put your lives in danger.  It is only right that I remain exiled here... until death frees me.~ [HJOLL043]
@102  = ~I'm afraid that is not possible.  I have been banished to this place for my treason.  Here I must remain until death's shadow falls upon me.~ [HJOLL044]
@103  = ~I'm afraid not.  I have been banished by law.  No longer am I a shaman of the Tribe of the Bear.  I am even forbidden to commune with the spirits until my own is ready to join them.~ [HJOLL045]
@104  = ~Then we shall speak with the spirits of this island.  Perhaps they will tell us what to do.  Farewell.~
@105  = ~Despite the great lengths we've gone to rescue him from his banishment, Hjollder seems resigned to his fate.  Maybe the spirits of the Isle know something that might change his mind.~
@106  = ~I suspect your vision to be true.  However, I have already risked too much on visions.  If I am to act against my king, I must have proof.~ [HJOLL046]
@107  = ~You should not remain on this island.  The shame of this banishment is mine alone to bear.  So my king has decreed.~ [HJOLL047]
@108  = ~What if we were to tell you that Wylfdene isn't who he claims to be?~
@109  = ~We'd like to return to Kuldahar now.~
@110  = ~You have returned.  Have you found any clues within the barrows?~ [HJOLL048]
@111  = ~Not yet... we're still looking.  Farewell.~
@112  = ~This is Wylfdene's tribal insignia.  Such chains are worn by the kings of my people and are considered the most precious of worldly possessions.~ [HJOLL049]
@113  = ~So?~
@114  = ~No true tribesman would dare to deface so sacred an object.  If Wylfdene is responsible for this desecration, then it is *not* the spirit of Jerrod that now inhabits his body.~ [HJOLL050]
@115  = ~If not Jerrod, then who?~
@116  = ~I see.  What do we do now?~
@117  = ~We have provided you with the proof you needed... now we would like to return to Kuldahar.~
@118  = ~This I do not know.  Even in my visions, the face of the king is obscured... almost as if my vision is opposed.~ [HJOLL051]
@119  = ~There is one who might help us in our quest.  If legend holds true, she may be able to see this soul for what it truly is.~ [HJOLL052]
@120  = ~Who is this person you speak of?~
@121  = ~She is known as the Gloomfrost Seer.  She was once a powerful channeler of spirits that lived among the Tribe of the Elk.~ [HJOLL053]
@122  = ~The legend says that her gift of sight was so great it turned her eyes to dust.  It is said she fled north, to dwell within the darkness of the Gloomfrost.~ [HJOLL054]
@123  = ~You think this woman can help?~
@124  = ~What is the Gloomfrost?~
@125  = ~On second thought... we'd like to return to Kuldahar first.~
@126  = ~On second thought... I think we've done enough for you and your people.  Farewell.~
@127  = ~The Gloomfrost Seer sees many things that are kept from the eyes of mortals.  If she still lives, she may be the *only* help for us now.~ [HJOLL055]
@128  = ~What exactly is the Gloomfrost?~
@129  = ~So where can we find this witch?~
@130  = ~The Gloomfrost lies far to the northeast, beyond the Reghed Glacier.  It is an ancient place, as old as the world itself.~ [HJOLL056]
@131  = ~The tales of my people say that the Gloomfrost marks the place where the sun was expelled from the womb of Toril when she was still a young mother.~ [HJOLL057]
@132  = ~It is said that the heat of the infant sun scarred the glacier as it fled to the sky, turning the ice black as night and casting the surrounding land into darkness.  ~ [HJOLL058]
@133  = ~Sounds like a cheerful place.  How do we find it?~
@134  = ~I shall mark the way upon your map.  Make haste in your journey, but beware... the guardians of the Gloomfrost protect the Seer from the intrusions of man.  Only those who prove themselves worthy shall be granted her wisdom.~ [HJOLL059]
@135  = ~Very well.  We'll make for the Gloomfrost without delay.~
@136  = ~In order to discover the true identity of the spirit inhabiting Wylfdene's body, Hjollder has asked us to seek out a tribal oracle known as the Gloomfrost Seer.  He marked the location of where to search for this seer on our map.  Once we have found her and learned the truth about Wylfdene, we are to return to the barbarian camp and demand an audience with the council.~
@137  = ~I shall defy banishment and return to the camp in secret.  If you are successful, go directly to the Mead Hall and demand an audience with Wylfdene.  Together, we shall expose him and put an end to his evil.~ [HJOLL060]
@138  = ~Hjollder told us he was going to defy banishment and return to the barbarian camp in secret. The camp is well guarded and would be difficult, if not impossible, to enter. Perhaps he means to hide in the forest nearby. We should search for him there.~
@139  = ~Very well.  I shall honor my word and return you to the town under the great tree.  ~ [HJOLL061]
@140  = ~Thank you.~
@141  = ~I have done as you asked.  However, our quest is far from complete.  I shall remain here until you are ready to return to the task of saving my people.~ [HJOLL062]
@142  = ~We are ready to return to the north.  Let us be off.~
@143  = ~We'll be back when we're ready to go back.  Farewell.~
@144  = ~Welcome back, heroes.  Are you ready to resume our quest?~ [HJOLL063]
@145  = ~Yes.  Let us return to the north.~
@146  = ~We are not ready to return just yet.  Farewell.~
@147  = ~We have little time.  We must discover the truth behind Wylfdene's treachery before it is too late.~ [HJOLL064]
@148  = ~Very well.  Tell us what needs to be done.~
@149  = ~Tell us again of this Gloomfrost Seer.~
@150  = ~Don't worry... we'll find this Seer and learn what we can.~
@151  = ~It is good to see you again, friend.  Take care... if we are discovered here together, our heads shall be mounted side by side before the entrance of Hengorot[Hen-gore-oh].~ [HJOLL065]
@152  = ~I assume that your presence here means you have succeeded in your quest to find the Gloomfrost Seer.  What have you learned?~ [HJOLL066]
@153  = ~Actually, we were unable to locate the Seer.~
@154  = ~We found the Seer, but the crazy old hag wasn't very helpful.  All she did was spout riddles.~
@155  = ~We found the Seer and she gave us a mirror crafted of ice.  She told us it would reveal the true form of Wylfdene's spirit.~
@156  = ~This is grave news.  Please... you must journey back to the Gloomfrost and find the Seer.  Her wisdom is the only hope for my people - and those of the Ten-Towns.~ [HJOLL067]
@157  = ~Very well.  We'll return when we've found her.~
@158  = ~You must understand, the Seer lives between two worlds... ours and the realm of the spirits.  Her words contain the knowledge we seek.  You must journey back to the Gloomfrost and give ear to the meaning behind her riddles.~ [HJOLL068]
@159  = ~Very well.  We'll return when we know more.~
@160  = ~Tempos has smiled upon our quest.  You must take this mirror to the Mead Hall and use it to expose Wylfdene before the council.~ [HJOLL069]
@161  = ~Easier said than done.  How are we to get past the guards outside?~
@162  = ~Here... take this chain.  It is the tribal insignia you found in Wylfdene's tomb.  Present it to Angaar[Ain-gar] at the entrance to the camp and demand an audience.  He would not dare refuse the bearer of such a token.~ [HJOLL070]
@163  = ~I hope you're right.  Farewell.~
@164  = ~We returned to the barbarian camp and told Hjollder about the mirror we obtained from the Gloomfrost Seer.  He instructed us to take the mirror to the Mead Hall and use its power to expose Wylfdene before the council.~
@165  = ~Why have you returned?[anxious, worried]  We have little time... you must gain an audience with the council and present the mirror to Wylfdene.~ [HJOLL071]
@166  = ~How do we get past the guards again?~
@167  = ~We'll get right on it.~
@168  = ~Speak with Angaar[Ain-gar].  He commands the guards at the entrance to the camp.  Show him Wylfdene's insignia and he will grant you an audience with the council.~ [HJOLL072]
@169  = ~Right.  Thank you, Hjollder.  Farewell.~
@170  = ~You have succeeded, my friends!  The corrupt spirit has fled Wylfdene's body!  Your heroic deeds shall forever be sung by my people.~ [HJOLL073]
@171  = ~However, I'm afraid our journey is not at an end.  This spirit... this malevolent soul of a great wyrm has fled the field, but it is still free to pursue its mission of terror and vengeance.~ [HJOLL074]
@172  = ~I fear that until it is hunted down and destroyed, the threat of its return will hang over the heads of my people like an evil cloud.~ [HJOLL075]
@173  = ~I would ask you to once again take up arms against this ancient hate, so that my people and yours can finally be at peace.~ [HJOLL076]
@174  = ~We'd like to help, but you said it yourself... the spirit has fled.  How are we to know where?~
@175  = ~Sorry, but we've done our part.  Now we wish to return to Kuldahar.~
@176  = ~I have learned that just two days ago, Wylfdene ordered a score of virgins to be taken by ship to an island upon the Sea of Moving Ice.~ [HJOLL077]
@177  = ~The island was once a sacred site where an elder tribe made sacrifices to their patron spirit, the Great Wyrm.  ~ [HJOLL078]
@178  = ~I believe that the spirit we routed today and the ancient spirit of the Great Wyrm are one and the same.  That is why Wylfdene ordered such a sacrifice.~ [HJOLL079]
@179  = ~So you think the spirit may have fled to this island?~
@180  = ~Yes.  A ship stands ready to take you to the island.  The warriors of the Tribe of the Grey Whale, our sea-faring cousins to the west, are prepared to show you the way.  ~ [HJOLL080]
@181  = ~Very well.  We shall leave at once.~
@182  = ~Actually... we're not up to the task just yet.~
@183  = ~Good luck, my friends.  May Tempos continue to show you favor upon the field of glory!~ [HJOLL081]
@184  = ~Farewell, Hjollder.~
@185  = ~By exposing Wylfdene before the council, we've succeeded in stopping the war between the barbarians and the Ten-Towns.  However, it seems our quest is far from over.  Hjollder believes that the corrupt spirit that fled Wylfdene's body may still pose a threat to his people.  We've agreed to journey by ship to an island on the Sea of Moving Ice.  Once there, we are to hunt down the flown spirit and put an end to its evil once and for all.~
@186  = ~I understand.  Such a task is not to be taken lightly.  Take what time you need to prepare yourselves.  Return to me when you are ready and I shall see you to your ship.~ [HJOLL082]
@187  = ~Thank you.  Farewell.~
@188  = ~Everything is in order.  Your ship stands ready to take you to the Isle of the Great Wyrm.  Are you prepared to depart?~ [HJOLL083]
@189  = ~We are ready.  Let us be off.~
@190  = ~Not just yet.  We still have preparations to make.~
@191  = ~Although I am certain you are the heroes of my vision, I fear you are not yet strong enough for the task at hand.  Go forth and sharpen your skills upon the field of valor.  When you've grown stronger, return here and we shall speak more.~ [HJOLL084]
@192  = ~We agreed to accompany the barbarian shaman, Hjollder on a quest to prevent a war between his people and the Ten-Towns.  However, he seems to feel we are not ready for the task at hand.  He asked us to return when we've grown stronger.~
@193  = ~The ancient tribe died out long ago, and with them died the practice of sacrificing virgins to appease the Great Wyrm.~ [HJOLL085]
