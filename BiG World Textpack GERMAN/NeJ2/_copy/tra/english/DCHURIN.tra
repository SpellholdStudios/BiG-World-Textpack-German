@0    = ~Good day.  I am Churin.  How may I help you?~
@1    = ~Well met.  I am <GABBER>.  What do you do here, Churin?~
@2    = ~Good day to you, Churin. Have you heard about anything interesting happening in Easthaven lately?~
@3    = ~Oh, no need to help. I was just passing by.  Farewell.~
@4    = ~Me?  Ah, nothing much.  I manage this warehouse here for the fishmonger, Gaspar.  I get paid a sum to store scrimshaw and emergency food supplies here through the harsh winters.~
@5    = ~Well, that certainly sounds like it would be important in a place like this.  What does the rest of Easthaven do?~
@6    = ~Harsh winters, eh?  Sounds lovely.  Anything interesting happen around town lately?~
@7    = ~An important job, certainly.  I must be off now, Churin.  Farewell.~
@8    = ~Well, most of them fish for Knucklehead Trout in Lac Dinneshere.  It's not a rich living in terms of wealth, but living up here, a man can still lead a very rich life.~
@9    = ~I see.  Have you heard anything interesting around town lately?~
@10   = ~Interesting.  Thanks for the information.  Farewell.~
@11   = ~Well, spending as much time as I do here in this stuffy ol' warehouse, I don't get to hear much gossip.  If you really want to know what's going on in these parts, I suggest you buy a few rounds over at the Winter's Cradle tavern.  You'll find that drinking and spinning yarns are two of Easthaven's favorite pastimes.~
@12   = ~Interesting.  Tell me, what do you do for a living, Churin?~
@13   = ~The tavern eh?  Alright, I'll try my luck there.  Farewell.~
@14   = ~Hello again.  Can I help you with something?~
@15   = ~Have you heard any interesting news lately, Churin?~
@16   = ~What do you do for a living, Churin?~
@17   = ~No, Churin, but thanks for the offer.  Farewell.~
@18   = ~Amazing.  I didn't think anyone could put down those brutes.  You should speak with Everard.  He'll be wanting to form a plan to save us all.~
@19   = ~I shall speak with him straight away.  Farewell.~
@20   = ~Thank you for saving us.  The last thing I wanted was to die in this miserable town.~
@21   = ~You're welcome.  Farewell.~
