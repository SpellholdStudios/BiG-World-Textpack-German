@0    = ~Journey to Ulcaster.

I have agreed to journey with Hrothgar to Ulcaster ruins... forgive my delay Imoen but when I look into the face of the man Hrothgar, I feel that this is the right thing for me to do... you of all people should know that often the road I must take is not always the one I would choose. Hrothgar says very little but I believe he knows much ... this I am sure or I would not trust and follow him. Nevertheless, I will watch him closely.~
@1    = ~The Second Key Quest.

I have agreed to join Hrothgar on his journey to Ulcaster and aid him in his search for a mysterious key. He has assured me that Imoen will be found in time but will say no more... for some inexplicable reason, I believe him. We make for the ruins of Ulcaster this day.~
