@0    = ~You, Prime Dweller, you have trod the wrong path.  All Primes who attempt to close these portals will die by the elements.~
@1    = ~Hey, we're not trying to close your portals.~
@2    = ~If you try to harm me in any way, I'll knock you back to your home plane so fast you'll wish you were encased in ice.~
@3    = ~Do your worst.  I am not afraid.~
@4    = ~Perhaps not... but I am not in the trusting mood today.  I have no pity for you Primes.  Now, taste the flames you so carelessly abuse.~
@5    = ~We shall see about that, boastful one.  If your kind were more respectful of us purebloods, perhaps you would live longer.~
