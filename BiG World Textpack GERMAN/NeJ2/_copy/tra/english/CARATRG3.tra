@0    = ~Search for the Heartstone Gem.

We penetrated the inner sanctum of the Temple of the Forgotten God only to find that someone had gotten their before us. The pedestal that, presumably, had once held the artifact was empty. Bodies lay strewn about the chamber, indicating that the acolytes and their verbeeg guardians had put up fight in the defense of the gem. Among the bodies was the corpse of man garbed in the vestments of a priest of Talona. It is difficult to say what part he might have played in the battle or the resulting theft. Perhaps we should return to Arundel and see what sense he can make of all this.~
