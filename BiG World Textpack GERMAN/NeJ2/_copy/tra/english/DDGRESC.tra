@0    = ~Don't trust Nym.  That creature has a heart to match the shade of his skin.  Some say that he used to be a member of a noble house.~
@1    = ~It's a good thing most of our women got to safety long ago.  Dirty Llew would... ugh.~
@2    = ~I hear that Malavon hired some drow mercenaries to help the orogs fortify Upper Dorn's.~
@3    = ~I long for the day when my brothers and sisters will be back with us again.~
@4    = ~I hate umber hulks.  Hate 'em.  Put them under the control of a drow like Malavon and they're three times as bad.~
@5    = ~There's a fallen temple to Berronar towards the east in Lower Dorn's.  No slaves are allowed in.  Some say that the corrupted priests there have turned their followers into giant skeletons... and worse.~
@6    = ~People keep on talking about how the fire giants and Maiden Ilmadia are taking apart the Great Forge - but the Great Forge is across the sea of fire.  They already took that apart.  What they're trying to do now is take apart the refinery portals.  They purify the ore and allow elementals to cross into this world.~
@7    = ~The only reason the umber hulks serve Malavon is because he feeds them ore and gems that *we* mine.  He blinded a tribe of minotaurs to help the hulks guard his domes.  The minotaur's sense of smell guides them towards intruders.~
@8    = ~Some say that a failed paladin wanders the halls of Lower Dorn's, eternally searching for those responsible for the war between the elves and the dwarves.~
@9    = ~Nym gets to our village by levitating up through that black hole.  It's rumored that somewhere around here, there's a stash of potions and boots that can allow others to levitate...~
@10   = ~Marketh is guarded by two men - brothers named Fleezum and Flozem.  Fleezum does just about anything Marketh asks him to do.  Flozem doesn't seem to care much about Marketh *or* his brother.~
@11   = ~Malavon wasn't always a lieutenant of the mad priest.  His predecessor was a human wizard in red robes.  He's the one who created the orogs.  Malavon tricked him, though, and transformed him into an umber hulk.~
@12   = ~The priest in the bloody robes doesn't like it when his servants fail in their duties or behave erratically.  That's why Ilmadia was sent to watch over the fire giants.~
@13   = ~Stay away from Shikata, the salamander king.  He might look like all the others, but he's far more powerful.  I know a svirfneblin who tried to hit him with a rock.  He was burned to ash before Shikata even reached him.~
