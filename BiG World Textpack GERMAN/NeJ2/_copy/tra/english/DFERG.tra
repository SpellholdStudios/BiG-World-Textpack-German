@0    = ~Greetings, weary traveler.  Are you in need of aid?  ~
@1    = ~Has anyone ever told you that you look a lot like Brother Gus, the priest inside?~
@2    = ~Yes.  I'm a stranger to this town.  Perhaps you could tell me what services I may find here.~
@3    = ~Out of my way, you pious little toad!~
@4    = ~Just passing through.  Farewell.~
@5    = ~Yes, on numerous occasions.  It is not really much of a coincidence... considering that we are twins.~
@6    = ~Twins eh?  You even dress the same.  How quaint.~
@7    = ~Well, that explains it, then.  I was just curious.~
@8    = ~Great, two identical, sniveling servants of a pathetic God... just what this world needs.~
@9    = ~Of course.  What services in particular do you seek?~
@10   = ~I am in need of a healer.~
@11   = ~I am in need of a place to rest for the night.~
@12   = ~I could use a drink.~
@13   = ~I'm looking to purchase weapons and equipment.~
@14   = ~Never mind.  I'll find them on my own.  Farewell.~
@15   = ~Then the blessings of the Broken God are upon you, for you stand before the House of the Bleeding Rose.  This is a place dedicated to the worship of the Lord on the Rack, Ilmater.  All who are in need of succor are welcome here.  Please, step inside and Revered Sister Calliana shall ease your suffering, friend.~
@16   = ~My thanks.  Could you tell me what other services I might find hereabouts?~
@17   = ~Thank you.  Farewell.~
@18   = ~What travelers we get in this town can find lodging at the Evening Shade.  It is a modest Inn nestled within the trunk of the Great Oak.  It used to be run by a man named Eidan, but I understand it's come under new ownership.  I have not yet met the new owner, however, but I have heard he is a halfling gentleman from the south.~
@19   = ~My friend, those that embrace the Broken God needn't seek comfort at the bottom of a mug.  However, those that wish to indulge in spirits are oft found at the Root Cellar, a small tavern directly to the west of here.~
@20   = ~Spare me your dreary philosophies, priest.  I'd say you and the rest of your horsehair shirt-wearing, self-flagellating brethren could use a stiff drink or two -- or three!~
@21   = ~What weapons we have in Kuldahar are forged by Conlan the Blacksmith.  His smithy can be found on the northern edge of town.  As for general supplies, our local amateur scholar, Gerth, has a shop across town, near the western bridge.~
@22   = ~As a servant of Ilmater, it is my lot to suffer the indignities and persecution of others.  Your intolerance serves only to strengthen my faith.  For that... I thank you.  Farewell.~
@23   = ~Yes... well, is there some way I may be of assistance to you, friend?~
@24   = ~Get it straight, Brother... you are NOT my friend -- and neither is your damn twin.  So stop calling me that or I'll show you some real suffering.~
@25   = ~No thank you.  Farewell.~
@26   = ~Hello again, friend.  How can I be of service to you?~
@27   = ~Greetings, Brother Ferg.  Could you tell me what services I may find about town?~
@28   = ~You'd serve me best by staying out of my way, you miserable wretch!~
@29   = ~Nothing today, Brother.  Farewell.~
@30   = ~That's it!  I've had enough of your barbs!  Prepare yourself!~
