@0    = ~Mallan uss, dis malli usstan tal tanas talthalra.  Usstan zha Nym.~
@1    = ~Excuse me, but I don't understand what you're saying.~
@2    = ~Do not befoul this meeting with your corrupt dark elven speech.~
@3    = ~You must be able to see that I'm a dwarf, so I'm puzzled as to why you would *dare* speak your putrid drow language in my presence.~
@4    = ~Quit the mumbo-jumbo, friend.  Speak Common.~
@5    = ~Die, drow scum!~
@6    = ~I apologize, honored customer.  I will speak in your Common tongue for our mutual convenience.  I am Nym.~
@7    = ~Customer?  Are you a merchant of some kind?~
@8    = ~Great.  Show me your wares.~
@9    = ~How did a dark elf wind up in a village of deep gnomes?  Deep gnomes hate drow, don't they?~
@10   = ~Well, Nym... die, drow scum!~
@11   = ~I have to go.  Farewell, Nym.~
@12   = ~As you wish.  I will continue in the Common tongue of surface dwellers if that makes you feel more at ease.  I am Nym.  Now, shall we get down to business?~
@13   = ~Business?  Are you a merchant of some kind? ~
@14   = ~Certainly.  Show me what you have to offer.~
@15   = ~How did a *drow* like *you* wind up in a community of deep gnomes?  Deep gnomes hate your kind, don't they?~
@16   = ~No, I think not.  I think you'll be dying by my hand, drow.~
@17   = ~I must go now.  Farewell, Nym.~
@18   = ~I am a merchant in these darkened caverns, yes.  Contrary to what some surface-dwellers may think, there is an entire world down here.  People have the same needs here that they would have anywhere.  I satisfy those needs.~
@19   = ~I'd like to see your goods.  Perhaps you have something that might interest me.~
@20   = ~Being an Underdark merchant sounds like it could be a dangerous and short career.~
@21   = ~You're about to satiate my yearly need to kill a manipulative dark elf bastard.~
@22   = ~Interesting.  Farewell, Nym.~
@23   = ~Dire need overcomes simple hatred in periods of duress.  I am a businessman.  Petty racial differences are irrelevant in my dealings.  The deep gnomes have gems.  I have goods.  It's an excellent relationship.  Most profitable.~
@24   = ~Manipulative scum like you should be wiped from the face *and* the bowels of Faerun.  I'll be doing the world a favor when I kill you.~
@25   = ~Hmm.  Farewell, Nym.~
@26   = ~For many, it is.  However, I have been in this trade for over four hundred years.  I have seen my way into and out of places that no other dark elf has even seen.  You'd be surprised how powerful a single merchant can be.~
@27   = ~Interesting.  Show me your goods.~
@28   = ~Really?  Where have you been?~
@29   = ~You're the one that's going to be surprised when I'm standing over your dying corpse.  I'm about to do the world a favor.~
@30   = ~I have to be going, Nym.  Farewell. ~
@31   = ~Ah, well... I have seen many things, been many places.  The gem mines of Thay aren't quite as frightening as some might lead you to believe.  The depths of the Moonsea *aren't* filled with undead.  Oh, and the treasury of Dorn's Deep wasn't very secure even when it was inhabited by the dwarves.  ~
@32   = ~Hmm.  Let me see your goods, Nym.~
@33   = ~Wait.  What are you getting at?~
@34   = ~I hate thieving drow scum.  Die!~
@35   = ~The darthiir and dwarven artifacts produced by the so-called "Time of Cooperation" were too valuable to resist.  Selling the artifacts to the goblinoid armies was the best business decision I ever made.~
@36   = ~Why's that?~
@37   = ~All those cursed elves, these ruined dwarven citadels... Two ancient cultures exterminated because of you, Nym.  That's it.  You're going to pay for what you did.~
@38   = ~I have to go now, Nym.  Farewell.~
@39   = ~It had so many angles to play.  The stupid goblins went bankrupt just to buy artifacts that they couldn't use properly.  The dwarves who were threatening to attack some drow outposts were implicated, and the darthiir slit their own throats when they decided to wage war against the goblins *and* dwarves.  Silly elves.~
@40   = ~You know, I'm not particularly fond of what you did, but you may have something I need.  Let me see what you have.~
@41   = ~Good job, Nym.  I would have made the same decision.  Now, if you would be so kind as to show me your wares...~
@42   = ~You bastard.  You're responsible for thousands upon thousands of deaths.  You may have gone for hundreds of years without getting caught, but you're not getting away from me.~
@43   = ~Farewell, Nym.~
@44   = ~Aluve.~
@45   = ~I welcome you back, honored customer.~
@46   = ~Show me your wares, Nym.~
@47   = ~Nym, isn't it dangerous being an Underdark merchant?~
@48   = ~I was just stopping to greet you.  Farewell.~
@49   = ~I welcome you back, honored customer.  That's an excellent shield you have there.  Rhino beetles are incredibly durable creatures.  You know, for such an honored customer, I might be able to have this enchanted...~
@50   = ~How much would it cost to enchant the shield?~
@51   = ~For the small sum of fifty thousand of your gold pieces, it could easily be done.~
@52   = ~Sounds good, Nym.  Here's the money.~
@53   = ~That's outrageous!  Lower your prices or I'm not interested.~
@54   = ~Maybe some other time.  Show me your wares, Nym.~
@55   = ~A most excellent choice, honored customer.  Come back in one day and your shield will be ready.~
@56   = ~Hmm.  You are not only incredibly powerful, but also a tough bargainer.  I will give you an enchanted shield and this beautiful magical dagger for only fifty three thousand gold coins.~
@57   = ~Okay.  That seems reasonable.~
@58   = ~I don't want the dagger.  I just want the shield.  And I don't want to pay fifty three thousand gold for it.~
@59   = ~Your impeccable taste and shrewd business sense indicate fine breeding and a keen mind.  Here is your dagger, honored customer.  The shield will be ready in one day.~
@60   = ~Of course, of course.  It was insulting of me to imply otherwise.  What would this honored customer want with a trinket, a small jeweled dagger, a nothing?  To apologize for the insult, I will offer you a more powerful enchantment on the shield for a lower price.  Your charisma has swayed me down to the insane price of forty eight thousand gold coins.~
@61   = ~That sounds like a good offer.  Here's the money, Nym.~
@62   = ~Forget it.  I'm not interested.  Farewell, Nym.~
@63   = ~Honored customer, it appears that you do not have the funds necessary for this purchase.  As a token of my appreciation to you, I will not give this opportunity to anyone else.  Should you return with the required funds in the future, the offer will remain open.~
@64   = ~I apologize, honored customer.  Your shield is not yet done being enchanted.  Despite the fact that drow wizards can work incredibly fast, they must work for at least three days to create such a powerful item.~
@65   = ~I welcome you back, honored customer.  Your shield is finished.  I hope that you are pleased with the results.~
@66   = ~Thanks.  Show me your wares, Nym.~
@67   = ~Thanks.  Farewell, Nym.~
