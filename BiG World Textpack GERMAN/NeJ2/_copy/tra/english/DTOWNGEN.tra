@0    = ~Easthaven?  Lived here for quite a span, I have.  Things have been getting worse of late, though.~
@1    = ~Do you mean the weather?~
@2    = ~Worse?  How?~
@3    = ~I've heard some talk of goblins and orcs.~
@4    = ~I've heard talk about goblins, orcs, and even a wolf.  Is that what you mean?~
@5    = ~I've heard some rumors about creatures sighted outside of town.  What have you heard?~
@6    = ~Between the weather and missing caravans, the people seem to be handling the troubles pretty well.~
@7    = ~Any other monster sightings recently?~
@8    = ~I've heard some rumors along those lines.  Can you tell me anything about the townsfolk?~
@9    = ~Do you know where I can find Hrothgar's house?~
@10   = ~Can you tell me a little about the town? ~
@11   = ~I must take my leave.  Farewell.~
@12   = ~Another dwarf in town, I see.  You with Hildreth?  I figure you dwarves might be looking to take back some of your old cities in the Spine of the World.~
@13   = ~Hildreth?~
@14   = ~No, Hildreth and I being in Easthaven is just a coincidence.~
@15   = ~Old cities?~
@16   = ~No, actually I just wanted to ask you about Easthaven.~
@17   = ~Aye, I think that's her name - she came into town a few days ago.  Have to say, I thought she was a man at first, with that beard and all.  Can't see how you dwarves get used to it.  ~
@18   = ~Hildreth... I may go look for her after we speak, then.  I wanted to ask you about Easthaven first, though.~
@19   = ~What was that you said about old cities?~
@20   = ~You realize, of course, *I* am a woman.  And I like my beard VERY much, thank you.~
@21   = ~Well, hell, it's no more disturbing to us than seeing those hatchet-chins your women have.  Makes my stomach churn.~
@22   = ~You don't need to play the innocent with me, friend.  I know you're looking to take back one of those gold-filled dwarven cities from those goblinoid bastards, aren't you?  What - Lower Dorn's Deep, Upper Dorn's Deep?~
@23   = ~I'm not familiar with those places.  What are they?~
@24   = ~Neither -- I just wanted to ask you about Easthaven.~
@25   = ~Hmmmm.  Maybe you *are* fresh to those names.  Here tell, Lower and Upper Dorn's Deep were dwarven citadels that fell to the goblins a few hundred years ago.  The dwarves were supposed to have an alliance with the elves, but it fell apart, and the orcs and goblins ran rampant over the region.  Probably still some great treasures lying around in those halls, too... but I don't need to tell you that.~
@26   = ~Hmmmm.  Well, maybe I *am* looking to take them back.  If you were willing to contribute some to the expedition, I'm sure the dwarves would return your contribution a hundred-fold... but I'm not making any promises, mind you.~
@27   = ~I see.  Look, I have some questions about Easthaven.~
@28   = ~Hells, good enough risk for me... here, I've got a little "nest egg" stored up just for such a chance.  Take it - if you dwarves take back Upper and Lower Dorn's, I'll be waiting for the return.~
@29   = ~Excellent, it's a deal then.  But before I go on my, uh, secret dwarven expedition, I wanted to ask you some things about Easthaven.~
@30   = ~Damn, first one elf, then another.  Thought your kind didn't venture too far north.~
@31   = ~Another elf?  What other elf are you speaking of?~
@32   = ~Is that other elf Erevain at the Snowdrift Inn?~
@33   = ~We do now.  I had some questions about Easthaven that perhaps you could answer.~
@34   = ~Our 'kind'... as you put it... has been everywhere *already.*  Much of what you humans build your shanty towns upon was explored by elves long before you ever came here.~
@35   = ~There's some elf with an enchanted blade up at the Snowdrift Inn.  Didn't catch his name.  Air-vain, or something.  Queer-looking fellow.~
@36   = ~His name is 'Erevain,' and he looks quite normal to me.~
@37   = ~Maybe I'll go see if I can find him.  I had some questions about Easthaven first, however.~
@38   = ~Aye, that's his name.  Queer-looking sort.  Just came in a few days ago.~
@39   = ~He looks *quite* normal to me.~
@40   = ~Yes, we've met.  I had some questions about Easthaven that perhaps you could answer.~
@41   = ~Whoa, now... didn't mean any offense.  Just speaking my mind is all.  Sorry if it came out wrong.~
@42   = ~Apology accepted.  I had some questions about Easthaven that perhaps you could answer.~
@43   = ~In the future, keep the few thoughts you possess to yourself.  Now farewell.~
@44   = ~You Fiddlebender?  I've heard of you - you live in that wrecked airship in Kuldahar, don't you?~
@45   = ~No, no, I don't.  Who's 'Fiddlebender?'~
@46   = ~Er, no... I wanted to ask you about Easthaven.~
@47   = ~"Who's Fiddlebender?"  Huh.  Well, I heard he was a gnome who took up shop in Kuldahar, the town south of here.  You sure you haven't heard of him?  I thought the two of you might be related.~
@48   = ~No - but I'm interested to hear about this wrecked airship.~
@49   = ~No, no, we're not.  Look, I had some questions about Easthaven.~
@50   = ~Yeah, we're *all* related because we're gnomes.  Our kind really doesn't interbreed as much as you humans do.~
@51   = ~It's like a ship that floats on the air, lying wrecked right in the middle of Kuldahar.  I don't know if Fiddlebender crashed it there or not, but it must be something else.  Sure would like to see it.~
@52   = ~I'll have to make sure to see it if I go there.  Look, I had some questions about Easthaven.~
@53   = ~Hey, you're Fiddlebender, aren't you?  From Kuldahar?~
@54   = ~Look.  I am NOT this 'Fiddlebender' person.  That's someone else.  There's more than one gnome in the whole world, you know.~
@55   = ~Well, I'll be twice-damned!  Another halfling - seems the North isn't solely a human's land anymore.   What brings you here, little one? ~
@56   = ~Another halfling?~
@57   = ~Another halfling?  You referring to that halfling that's been seen in the Pass?~
@58   = ~I wanted to ask you about Easthaven.~
@59   = ~Why don't you lean a little closer and say that?  We 'little ones' are notoriously hard of hearing when we're about to teach a hairy ape some manners.~
@60   = ~Ha!  Simmer down there, little one.  No harm meant.  Look... you're new here.  Try some of the local catch - knucklehead trout are our local delicacy.~
@61   = ~All right, then.  Thank you.  Look, I had some questions about Easthaven that you might be able to help me with.~
@62   = ~Keep your jibes and your fish to yourself, Northerner.  Farewell.~
@63   = ~Whoa - my apologies, friend.  Didn't mean any insult.  Just trying to be friendly.~
@64   = ~All right, then.  I had some questions about Easthaven that you might be able to help me with.~
@65   = ~Keep your friendliness to yourself, Northerner, lest you make some enemies.  Farewell.~
@66   = ~Aye, there's a caravan merchant - don't recall his name off hand - who's been making his way back and forth through Kuldahar pass for the last few months.  Thought the two of you might be related.  ~
@67   = ~Where is he now?~
@68   = ~Yeah, we're *all* related because we're halflings.  Our kind really doesn't interbreed as much as you humans do.~
@69   = ~If the snow's any sign, he's probably holed up in Kuldahar, that big tree town to the south.  Not a bad place to be when the snows hit.~
@70   = ~Hmmmm.  I wanted to ask you some things about Easthaven.~
@71   = ~A minstrel!  Ha, now you're a sight for cold eyes.  Hasn't been much in the way of entertainment since Ol' Jed fell out of his boat last month in Dinneshere, and we had to fish him out before he pickled the lake.  So, minstrel, going to regale the Winter's Cradle with a few tales tonight?~
@72   = ~No, I intend to create some new tales during our stay here in the North.  I have one concerning our travel here, if you would hear it.~
@73   = ~Perhaps... but I would hear some tales from you first.  It's only fair, is it not?  Tell me of Easthaven.~
@74   = ~Sure would.  Anything'd be better than hearing the wind whistle across the lake.  Let's hear it, then.~
@75   = ~All right, then...~
@76   = ~That's fine verse, friend.  And quite stirring, too - I look forward to hearing more.  Take this small bit from me in case I don't make it to the Winter's Cradle tonight - it came from my brother in the south; he's a musician, too, and said I should pass it along to the next one I meet.  It's not much, but it should pay for your stay while you're in town.~
@77   = ~Thank you, you are most kind.  But enough of my tales -- tell me of Easthaven.~
@78   = ~Haven't seen you in town before.  You come from the south?~
@79   = ~Yes.  I wanted to ask you some things about this town.~
@80   = ~Of course.  I am a visitor to this town, and there are things I would know.~
@81   = ~Well, since you're new in town, you'll probably want to get a room at the Snowdrift Inn - it's on the eastern side of town.  The innkeeper, Quimby, he's a right enough sort.  He should have plenty of rooms available, but he just got an elf guest from the south, so at least one room is taken.~
@82   = ~Can you tell me any more about the town? ~
@83   = ~I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@84   = ~Aside from Quimby's inn, there's Pomab's Emporium in the northeast part of town.  He can be a right ass, Pomab can, so I hope you don't need to buy anything from that copper-clenching jackal.  Wish that damn Calishite had stayed down south with the rest of his kind.~
@85   = ~Well, there's the Temple of Tempus, that huge blue-glassed structure to the northwest, run by Everard.  Hear tell, Everard's the one who saw that messenger from Kuldahar, if you can believe it.  Fellow died right on his doorstep.~
@86   = ~Messenger?~
@87   = ~Any other places I should see while I'm here?~
@88   = ~Very well.  I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@89   = ~Aye, some fellow from Kuldahar just collapsed on the threshold of the Temple, all bloody.  Surprised he made it as far as he did - no one knows what he wanted, except maybe Hrothgar and Everard.~
@90   = ~Hmmm.  I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@91   = ~You might pay a visit to the scrimshander, Apsel, down to the southwest.  He's got some nice pieces of art, if you like that sort of thing.~
@92   = ~What's a scrimshander?~
@93   = ~A fishbone carver.  Apsel carves the bones of knucklehead trout into little sculptures and such.  Fetch a nice price down south, they do.~
@94   = ~I see.  I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@95   = ~Hrothgar's House is in the center northern part of town - it's the one with the gaps in the overhang.  Hrothgar swears he's going to fix it, but I'll believe *that* when I see it.  He's always running around trying to take care of everyone else.  Why you going to see him, anyway?  Planning to join his expedition?~
@96   = ~Expedition? ~
@97   = ~I was thinking about it.  I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@98   = ~Yeah, word is Hrothgar's been so rattled by that messenger from Kuldahar collapsing dead at the front door of the Temple of Tempus that he wants to put together a band to go see what's going on down south.~
@99   = ~What did this messenger say?~
@100  = ~Maybe I'll ask him about it.  In the meantime, I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@101  = ~Damned if I know.  Only Everard over at the Temple and Hrothgar would know for sure, I suppose.  Still, if it's enough to get the two of them riled up... can't be good.~
@102  = ~Maybe I'll ask them about it.  In the meantime, I wanted to ask you some other things about Easthaven.~
@103  = ~Aye, the weather's been going from bad to worse.  Never seen it get so cold this early in the year, and there's no sign of it letting up.  With all this snow, the passes to the south are going to get snowed in early.~
@104  = ~Well, there's been sighting of some goblins and such in the Pass, if you can believe that.  They usually hole up in the Spine of the World and kill each other.  Some fool claimed he even saw some orcs outside of town, but I'll wait until he sobers up before giving *that* tale any weight.~
@105  = ~Not only that, but there's been sighting of a wolf on the outskirts of town, too.  We've been keeping an eye out for it, but it seems to be coming around just for a whiff of the fishbone carvings in Apsel's workshop.  Damn thing must be starving to risk showing itself around humans, though.~
@106  = ~Well, there's that and more: One of the boys was out playing, and he swore that he saw a footprint in the snow as large as a man.  Assuming he's not telling tales, that would mean giants - but there hasn't been a giant seen in the Pass since... well, damn near since as long as I can remember.~
@107  = ~I'm worried the goblin and orc sightings are tied into the problems we've been having with the caravans of late.  Some of them have gone missing, but mostly only the ones coming from the south.  At first we thought the snows must be burying 'em, but with goblinoids about, it's more likely *they're* the ones that buried the caravans.~
@108  = ~Not all of them - Jhonen, one of the steadiest fellows I know, has been going round with some tune he keeps humming and looks like he hasn't been getting much sleep.  The troubles must be hitting him harder than we thought.~
@109  = ~He's humming a tune?~
@110  = ~Well, Jhonen was actually being spoken to by a sea spirit, if you can believe that.  She wanted to return an ancestral blade to him that was lost at the bottom of the lake.~
@111  = ~Aye, just keeps humming the damn thing over and over.  Boy's gonna get an oar in his chops if he keeps it up.~
@112  = ~Oh, *really?*  Ha!  Good one, stranger, but we Easthaven folks aren't as simple as you might think.  Go tell your tales to a merchant if you're looking for some amusement.~
@113  = ~Well, I don't know how much weight this carries, but one of the girls says she saw some blue-skinned figure down by the shore.  She said whoever it was was singing some song.  Probably just her imaginings.~
@114  = ~No, she was there all right.  She was singing to Jhonen because she loves him and wanted to give him the ancestral blade that belonged to one of his ancestors.~
@115  = ~Most of the folks around here are decent folks, but I'd stay away from Old Jed - he lives in a little shack near the shore of the lake.  Grisella at the Winter's Cradle cut him off, so that drunk fool'll try and get you to spot him a tankard.  Watch your purse, all right?~
@116  = ~Back again?  Forget something last time we spoke? ~
@117  = ~Just wanted to ask you some questions about Easthaven.~
@118  = ~Thank Tempus you're here!  Any longer, and our bodies would have been lining Lac Dinneshere - or the belly of a giant.~
@119  = ~What happened?~
@120  = ~You're free now - I suggest you get as far from Easthaven as possible.  Things may get a lot more violent before we've settled matters here.~
@121  = ~You!  You're part of the expedition that left with Hrothgar, aren't you!  We feared the worst --~
@122  = ~What happened while we were gone?~
@123  = ~Please - you must get us away from here.  Those giants - they'll kill us all if they catch us!~
@124  = ~You're free.  No more giants will block your path.  How did they get here?~
@125  = ~I barely know - it was a day like any other, mayhap more overcast than most.  The winds had been picking up all day, and the howling had finally driven us indoors.  I was drinking at the Winter's Cradle when a huge shaft of ice tore through the floor and into the ceiling!~
@126  = ~We ran from the building, only to see more spears of ice tearing up from the ground - and then the giants came, like great shadows out of the snows.  They killed all who resisted, and the others they snatched up and placed within this camp.~
@127  = ~Anyone manage to escape?~
@128  = ~A few, I think.  Everard's here with us, and despite the torture, he's been able to help us with the wounded - I haven't seen Jhonen, or Old Jed... and Pomab is nowhere to be found.  Maybe they made it to safety.  I can only pray.~
@129  = ~Everard was tortured?  Why?~
@130  = ~I do not know.  They took him to that great tower of ice for almost a half-day, then returned him to us, badly wounded.  Perhaps there was something in the Temple of Tempus they wanted.~
@131  = ~Hmm.  Perhaps I'll speak to Everard.  In any event, you're free now - I suggest you get as far from Easthaven as possible.  Things may get a lot more violent before we've settled matters here.~
@132  = ~May the Gods bless your weapons, friends.  And may they see fit to punish those who have attacked our town.~
@133  = ~I'm off to the tower, then.  And thanks for the blessing - I'll need all the help I can get.~
@134  = ~Farewell.~
@135  = ~Wait - there is one last thing we can do to help you.  We have few supplies left, but we were able to hide some healing items before we were taken by the giants.  If you're going to enter the tower, please take them.  You'll need them more than we will.~
@136  = ~Thank you.~
@137  = ~Hey... I remember you - you're part of that dwarven expedition looking to find those old dwarven citadels, right?  Easthaven's not much to look at now, I'm afraid.~
@138  = ~Expedition?  Oh, yeah, the expedition to reclaim the dwarven citadels... in all the confusion, I'd, uh, forgotten.~
@139  = ~So do I get a return on my investment?  I did lend you that gem a while back, if you recall.  ~
@140  = ~Sorry, we didn't find any old dwarven citadels brimming with treasure - just old dwarven citadels.~
@141  = ~Here's the return on your investment - five hundred gold coins.  You'll need it to help rebuild the town.~
@142  = ~I'd pay you back, but I don't have enough coins on me at the moment.~
@143  = ~I think now is hardly the time to be discussing this - your town has been attacked, and you need to get to safety.~
@144  = ~Just my luck.  You'd think I'd crossed Tymora the way life's been throwing "fortunes" at me lately.  No matter, then.  It was a risk.  At least I still have my life.~
@145  = ~You know, we're thinking about, er... mounting one last expedition into that crystal tower and taking the, uh, treasure within - though we could use a little help, if you have any extra gear you could give us.  We could, uh, pay you back later.  ~
@146  = ~That you do.  You'd best get to safety.~
@147  = ~Really?  Hmm.  Well, I... hmm.  All right, by the hells.  I was saving these for my escape and for making it through the miles of icy passes outside of Kuldahar, but I think I could part with them.  I, uh, found them in Hrothgar's House before the giants attacked.~
@148  = ~Thank you.  You know, of course, this does not mean I'm promising you'll get a return on your investment.~
@149  = ~Excellent.  You'd best get to safety.  ~
@150  = ~That's a risk I'm willing to take.  My motto is, if you're not willing to gamble...~
@151  = ~Indeed.  You'd best get to safety.  ~
@152  = ~Wh - thanks!  Ha!  I can't believe my good fortune!  I mean, well, outside of my home being destroyed by great shafts of ice and the attack by those giants, this is the windfall I've been waiting for!~
@153  = ~Uh, indeed.  Look, what happened here?~
@154  = ~I suppose so... look, you'd best get to safety.  ~
@155  = ~Heh -- first Hildreth, then you.  Maybe there *is* some truth to you dwarves planning an expedition to take back some of your old cities, eh?~
@156  = ~Heh -- just last week, Grisella mentioned some more dwarves might be coming into town.  Something about how the dwarves are looking to recover some of their old cities - you here with Hildreth?  ~
@157  = ~Well, now - been some time since I've seen an elf in this far north.  Now they seem to be coming to Easthaven in force.~
@158  = ~Are there other elves in town?~
@159  = ~Are you talking about that other elf at the Snowdrift Inn, Erevain?~
@160  = ~I had some questions about Easthaven that perhaps you could answer.~
@161  = ~Damn me - an elf.  Thought these climes would be too cold for your kind, yet here you are, two in as many days.~
@162  = ~Two elves?  Is there another elf in town?~
@163  = ~Yes?  Can I help you with something?~
@164  = ~Yes.  I wanted to ask you some things about Easthaven.~
@165  = ~I heard there were new faces in town.  Did you come with the caravan? ~
