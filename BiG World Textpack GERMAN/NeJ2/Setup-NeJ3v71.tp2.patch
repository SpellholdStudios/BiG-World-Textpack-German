Handing over the Heartstone Gem, the party stood back and watched Larrel begin his divination. With the artifact raised before him, clutched tightly in his skeletal hands, the undead sorcerer peered intently into the Gem as he whispered a series of strange chants and incantations. A spark of light briefly flashed within the Gem, as if a ray of sunlight had caught upon its surface. And suddenly, reflected within the mirrored facets of the stone, there appeared an image of a statue.  The statue was clearly a monument of sorts, depicting an elf and a dwarf sitting side by side on a dual throne.~ [scry]

On they traveled, across the windswept tundra of the Dale, through the foothills of the Spine of the World, and upwards on the steep and treacherous trails of the Kuldahar Pass. Eager to seek out the evil that threatened the Pass, they did not expect it to find them first.  High upon the cliffs of the Pass, a band of frost giants had prepared an ambush. Hurling boulders and dislodging massive outcroppings of rock and snow, the giants sparked an avalanche that thundered down the mountainside and crashed down upon the heads of the unsuspecting expedition. Those fortunate enough to survive the avalanche pulled themselves free of the mountain of snow and bodies that now barred the way back to Easthaven. Battered and disheartened by the loss of their comrades, the survivors had little choice but to continue on to Kuldahar... alone.~ [avalanch]

When the light finally died, the party discovered that they were no longer within the dark passages of Dorn's Deep. As they struggled to regain their bearings, they realized that they had been returned to the town of Easthaven. But this was not the sleepy fishing village they had left so long ago. An enchantment had fallen over the town, encasing what remained of the shattered homes and buildings in a prison of solid ice. At the center of the destruction, upon the very spot where the temple of Tempus once stood, rose a massive tower of crystal.~ [RETURN]

Hopefully, the artifact is still in their possession. After a day's journey through the mountains surrounding Kuldahar, the small band of would-be heroes finally stood before the towering crag of rock that marked the entrance to Dragon's Eye. Somewhere within the depths of the volcanic cavern lay the missing Heartstone Gem, and perhaps with it, the answer to who or what was behind the disturbances in Kuldahar.~ [intro4]

It would appear that he and Hrothgar are old friends... something he omitted to mention when I asked him about Tilorn’s mysterious visit to Arundel in Kuldahar. After a brief introduction Tilorn set about explaining his reason for being at Ulcaster... an incredulous story. It would appear there is something amiss in the realms, something upsetting the balance between past and future... Tilorn believes it all began with the untimely fall of Ulcaster after an assault by Halruaa, an academy for specialist magic. He proposes to send us to Halruaa, prior to the event which led to Ulcaster’s downfall... once there we are to find that which sparked the assault and prevent it from happening. Thus preserving all the knowledge contained in Ulcaster’s walls that may be of help in averting the impending chaos in the future. Tilorn’s arrival at Ulcaster before our own only leads me to believe that both he and Hrothgar are keeping much from me and yet they expect me to trust and aid them without question. Tilorn’s fantastic tale of the balance between past and future being upset brings to my mind the conversation between Hrothgar and Gorion that I witnessed whilst travelling the portal from Kuldahar... *I already feel the adverse effects the imbalance between future and past is having on The Realms*... those were the words Hrothgar spoke and now Tilorn speaks of the same imbalance. Was it a dream I now find myself asking, or maybe a glimpse of another time as I fell through the dimensions back to the present, and why was Hrothgar so quick to dismiss it as such? Perhaps by accepting Tilorn’s task I may discover who these two men are who speak of travelling through time as though it were as simple as opening a door. If Hrothgar of Easthaven weren’t standing beside me now I would say Tilorn was insane... as it is who am I to judge what is and what isn’t possible anymore. So I have agreed to help and now stand stripped of all armour and weapons, clothed in wizard robes... ready to depart for Halruaa.~ [intro5]

On another occasion, Bron‘s cowardly companions abandoned him when they were attacked by dire wolves in the wilderness.  Two weeks later, Bron swaggered into their camp wearing wolfskins.  Whether all of the tales surrounding Bron are true or not, it is known that Bron is believed to have met his end in the Spine of the World mountains, fighting polar worms.

Traditional Faerunian card games include Whist, Poker, Talison, Elemental Empires, Old Wizard, and Mac‘s Snake.~ 
-  SAY DESC ~The secret procedure for manufacturing these cards was only recently recovered by the sorceress Haelia.  Blur Decks are thin ivory cards that are typically kept in a strong metal case.  When the owner of the cards wishes to use them, he or she simply needs to shuffle the cards and throw one up in the air.  The value of the card (unknown to the user) determines the duration of the effect.  These cards used to be employed by the warrior minions of Porg the Stout.  Porg‘s reliance on the cards proved to be his downfall when a group of adventurers, using his cards, killed him in his tower in 833 DR.

Many agree that a mythal is alive, and is a huge web of magical forces woven together by magic and the lifeforces of the casters.  The mythal is believed to be sustained by the natural mechanisms within and around it, from the wind to the current of a brook or a temperature shift from the energy of sunlight.  Given the ties to life and Faerun, mythals can hardly be common wizardry, no matter what may have been said in the past.

Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair‘s followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite‘s antics.  Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep.  After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic.  He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit‘s creation.  Following his master‘s instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail.  He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours.  When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate.  Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years.  His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn.  The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious.

-Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva‘s secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar.  With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her.  When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury.  The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge.  Gaedel‘s family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at loss of most of their house.  Mithran‘s cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake.

Most broad swords have a basket hilt or a shell guard.  A favored cavalry weapon, the broad sword is known in different cultures by different names, usually dependant on the hilt configuration.  The heavier blade of the broad sword makes it slightly slower and more damaging than a long sword.~ 
-  SAY DESC ~This sword, an oddity amonst elves who normally prefer lighter blades, the original Greycloak owner passed this owneron after years of service. Kethryllia Amaranthine reforged this sword 1221 DR for Erevain Blacksheaf's initiation to the Evereskan Greycloaks. It has since been significantly enhanced because Erevain requested this sword be heavier, more damaging and grants numerous protections. It was later redecorated to openly display the Blacksheaf family crest.

When the mountain temple where the morning star was contained was sacked by giants in 1190 DR, the history of the weapon ended.

Durlow‘s hammer, like many dwarven weapons, was forged and blessed with power by priests of Moradin.  It earned its name in Durlow‘s service, where he used it to drive back drow wizards and their summoned abyssal allies.  Legends say that Durlow even defeated one of the dreaded Yochlol, the "Handmaidens of Lolth."  Durlow met his end when the drow employed treachery to defeat him.  Under magical disguise, drow assassins visited Durlow‘s fortified city as human ambassadors from Tethyr.  They then poisoned Durlow‘s food, which he ate in front of them.  Durlow eventually realized what was happening and managed to stumble to his room and grab Hellpick.  In the resulting battle, Durlow managed to kill four of the five assassins before he fell victim to the effects of the poison.  The fifth assassin is believed to have escaped.

-  SAY DESC ~These ancient helms were once common among the Reghedmen barbarians who came to what is now known as Icewind Dale.  The design of the armor is relatively simple: a plain iron helm with a hinged faceplate.  Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate.  The name of the warrior and a one word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask.  The helm was then left in the dead warrior‘s funeral pyre.  The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man‘s fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos.  After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests.  Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals.  According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear.  This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe".

-  SAY DESC ~This seemingly threadbare robe had become "dormant" upon Lysan‘s command, so as not to expose herself as a priestess of Auril. When as much as a single snowflake falls upon the robe, it transforms into a scintillating cloak of white that allows the wielder to float above snow drifts and walk through even raging rivers with ease. Most merchants will not wish to purchase this item, or will do so at a very low price, as they see it as a sacred item of Auril the Frost-Maiden and likely to attract her followers... and her displeasure. 
-
-Created during the ceremonies of the Coming Storm (the onset of winter) to Auril, these robes are specially created to resist flames and allow the wearer to resist any attempt to stop or hold them. Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, whether Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells and the like.

The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old.  The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush.  It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, that he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him.  He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerun.  It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

When the nervous defenders tried to form a line of pikes, Kath and other heavily armoured men would wade into the fray, hacking their weapons apart and breaking their formation.  Once the villagers had been sent into disarray, his men would fall in with cavalry and take what they wanted.

The scales are left to soak in a mixture of venom, ground poppies, and a variety of other strange ingredients for a full month. At the end of this time, the scales are burned and rolled in another mixture of oils and powders until it takes on the consistency of thick butter.  A variety of spells are then cast upon the mixture to give the oil its full powers.  When used, the target‘s skin becomes tough, green, and scaly.  While the oil is extremely useful, it takes a full round to adequately smear it over the recipient‘s body.

-A powerful weapon and tool, this staff was created by the powerful archmage Ubath of the Celestial Sign. Originally of Algarond, Ubath commanded great respect for his skills as a summoner of beasts and elementals. Unfortunately, Ubath‘s desire for power drove him to extreme lengths. His conjuring of extremely powerful entities from the lower planes is what eventually did him in. This staff is his most prominent legacy. It was left behind, slightly blackened, when he was dragged away to Acheron.

He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead.  He considered undead to be, in his words, "Unoriginal, tired old jokes."  "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of?  They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time.  I‘m supposed to be scared of that?"  He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way.  Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power.  Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death.  Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead.  He was not as light-hearted about the walking dead after that.

-  An elite group of elven fighter mages, the blade-singers are dedicated to the defense of the elven nation, and many of them journey back to Faerun to help defend those elves who stayed behind or have yet to join the Retreat.  
-  Bladesingers are terrifying weapons experts and spellcasters.  On Evermeet they are organized into small warrior lodges, each specializing in a different weapon.  They are even more dedicated to the ancient ways and styles of dress than other Silver elves.  They often tattoo themselves with old runes and symbols and their armor and weapon are all of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship.~

-  Corellon embodies the highest values of that which is elvenkind.  From the gentle aspects of art and poetry to the hasher aspects of war and magic, he is venerated by all the Fair Folk, except that of the drow.  Vigilant over his creations, it is told that Corellon will wander the elven lands, observing his people and defending what is theirs.~

They are trained in what to eat, various combat routines involving aerial and ground attacks, and to respond to the commands of its rider.  The riders are educated in the ways of grooming and caring for its mount, how to work effectively with his hippogriff, and also in the ways of aerial and ground combat.

-  Labelas Enoreth is the elven god of longevity and time.  At the creation of the Fair Folk, Labelas blessed the elves with long lifespans and decreed that their appearances would not be marked by the passage of time.  The lifegiver cooperates with Sehanine in overseeing the lifespan of elves and their growth away from and beyond the mortal realms.  He measures the lives of the Fair Folk and decrees when they should be ended, allowing passage to Arvandor.  As Lord of the Continuum, Labelas governs the orderly passage of time and guards against those who would alter the path of history.  Labelas confers wisdom and teachings on young and old alike, and although he is rarely invoked, the Lifegiver is often praised.  The Lifegiver knows the future and past of every elf, faerie, or sylvan creature.  Labelas is worshiped by sages, historians, philosophers, librarians, and all those who measure the changes wrought by the passing of years.~

She watches over the dreams of the elves, keeping them from harm while in reverie and sending omens to protect them from future dangers.  Sehanine watches over the passage of the elven spirits from the world, and she is protectress of the dead...

-... Aside from the High Mages, none are certain about the true nature of mythals, no matter how well versed they are in ancient elven lore of old or current debates on magical theory.  Many agree that a mythal is alive, and is a huge web of magical forces woven together by magic and the lifeforces of the casters.  The mythal is believed to be sustained by the natural mechanisms within and around it, from the wind to the current of a brook or a temperature shift from the energy of sunlight.  Given the ties to life and Faerun, mythals can hardly be common wizardry, no matter what may have been said in the past.  The mythals and their magic are tied directly to the Weave, the source of all Torillian magic...~

-  Shevarash, who embodies the hatred as the Fair Folk hold for the drow, is the elven god of vengeance and military crusades.  He is venerated by the elves and half-elves who have suffered the loss of loved ones through violence, particularly those who burn with revenge against the drow, and by those who have sworn to destroy the Spider Queen and the other evil gods of the dark elves.  Some elven theologians speculate that Shevarash serves to gather in the bitterness and hatred that has riven the elven race since the Crown Wars, thus keeping the contagious evil of the Spider Queen from spreading to the elven population at large.~

With the aid of the cittern, he helped the Company of Frozen Trees defeat a young green dragon in 1013 DR.

The wizard Bemban of Immersea was known to be quite fond of these pointed hats both for their appearance and their power.  Many wizards sought their own Dominants, but their distinctive appearance soon became the butt of many jokes among adventurers.  Bemban grew senile in his later years, and left most of his fortune to private mages in the hope that they would continue to make his favorite magical hat.

-  SAY DESC ~Owain‘s Lullabye was created by a disturbed bard named Owain Piper.  Piper was a worshipper of Auril, born in the town of Silverymoon and raised to embrace the frigid environment of his homeland.  He traveled extensively in the Moonsea, where he met a mage named Pelham of the Moor.  Owain and Pelham became good friends and stayed in contact for over a decade.  Pelham eventually enchanted Owain‘s Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money.  Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake.  He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter.  As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain‘s horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

She, however, gave birth to a half-monstrous child, to whom she was so attached to in her madness that none dared to kill the child, as it is customary done. Dar grew in the sanctuary of Ilmater. He was educated and tutored by priests, though he does not exhibit slurry speech and after knowing him for a while you‘d come to a conclusion that he might not be the brightest fellow, but he has a heart of gold, and a gentle and noble soul, and shows no trait of the savagery of his orcish heritage. He displays great loyalty to those that take the time to befriend him. When you ask him about his atypically fluent speech, he tells you that he owes his excellent knowledge and usage of the common tongue, rarely found in his kind, to the patience and tutoring of the priests that raised him. "It is because of them", he says, "that I am what I am today".~

-  SAY BIO ~Dar‘s conception is the usual one for a half-orc: his mother was mercilessly raped by raiding orcs. The woman was in terrifying condition. She was picked up by priests of Ilmater and taken to their Temple, where she was restored to physical health. Unfortunately, her mind was gone. She, however, gave birth to a half-monstrous child, to whom she was so attached to in her madness that none dared to kill the child, as it is customary done. Dar grew in the sanctuary of Ilmater. He was educated and tutored by priests, though he does not exhibit slurry speech and after knowing him for a while you‘d come to a conclusion that he might not be the brightest fellow, but he has a heart of gold, and a gentle and noble soul, and shows no trait of the savagery of his orcish heritage. He displays great loyalty to those that take the time to befriend him. When you ask him about his atypically fluent speech, he tells you that he owes his excellent knowledge and usage of the common tongue, rarely found in his kind, to the patience and tutoring of the priests that raised him. "It is because of them", he says, "that I am what I am today".~

Originally from Hillsfar, he has spent many years adventuring the length and breadth of Faerun and eventually settled in Easthaven, a small town on The Spine Of The World. In his home you see many momentos and trinkets that he has acquired from his days as an adventurer. As a fair and just man Hrothgar, quickly earned  the respect of the townsfolk and was chosen as its mayor, a job that Hrothgar took very seriously, would protect the townsfolk with his own life.

The truth of what actually happened is known only to Hrothgar himself. His re-appearance a hundred years after these events is as mysterious as was his disappearance. When first you speak to Hrothgar you get a sense that you should know this burly man but the feeling passes as quickly as it came. If you ask Hrothgar about what rumour and legend say of him, he will laugh loudly and say, "So that is what the name Hrothgar has come to mean is it."

-  SAY BIO ~Hrothgar has the air about him of a man that has seen a lot but says very little. Originally from Hillsfar, he has spent many years adventuring the length and breadth of Faerun and eventually settled in Easthaven, a small town on The Spine Of The World. In his home you see many momentos and trinkets that he has acquired from his days as an adventurer. As a fair and just man Hrothgar, quickly earned  the respect of the townsfolk and was chosen as its mayor, a job that Hrothgar took very seriously, would protect the townsfolk with his own life. It was whilst fighting a powerful demon, that Hrothgar lost his life, slain by the demon, or so rumour and legend would have you believe. The truth of what actually happened is known only to Hrothgar himself. His re-appearance a hundred years after these events is as mysterious as was his disappearance. When first you speak to Hrothgar you get a sense that you should know this burly man but the feeling passes as quickly as it came. If you ask Hrothgar about what rumour and legend say of him, he will laugh loudly and say, "So that is what the name Hrothgar has come to mean is it." You learn more of the truth as you travel together.~

Originally from Hillsfar, he has spent many years adventuring the length and breadth of Faerun and eventually settled in Easthaven, a small town on The Spine Of The World. In his home you see many momentos and trinkets that he has acquired from his days as an adventurer. As a fair and just man Hrothgar, quickly earned  the respect of the townsfolk and was chosen as its mayor, a job that Hrothgar took very seriously, would protect the townsfolk with his own life. It was whilst fighting a powerful demon, that Hrothgar lost his life, slain by the demon, or so rumour and legend would have you believe. The truth of what actually happened is known only to Hrothgar himself. His re-appearance a hundred years after these events is as mysterious as was his disappearance. When first you speak to Hrothgar you get a sense that you should know this burly man but the feeling passes as quickly as it came. If you ask Hrothgar about what rumour and legend say of him, he will laugh loudly and say, "So that is what the name Hrothgar has come to mean is it." You learn more of the truth as you travel together.~

Trapped creatures can neither move nor speak and will die within 1 turn due to lack of air. Creatures can save vs.spells per round. Each round the save fails any trapped creature suffers a loss of 1 quarter total hit points until death. If save thrown successful creatures are still trapped but do not suffer the hit point loss. Creatures that do not breath air do not suffer the hit point loss but are still rendered immobile.
-
-4.Spontaneous Combustion:
-   When activated all flammable objects within a 10 ft. Cubic area bursts into flame. The effect can be cast out to a range 50 yards. The fire burns for one turn doing 10d6 damage per round to creatures trapped in the blaze. Creatures can save vs. spell each round for half damage until they die or escape the blaze. Creatures immune to fire suffer no damage.~

I didn’t think Halruaa was taking in any new students until this business with Ulcaster and his damn academy had been dealt with... anyway it is imperative that Garron now be given instructions on deployment of the leveller. So Vrielle, could you please contact Brial and ask her to bring him with her.

- Halruaa appears to have visitors who have shown more than a students interest in the academy’s affairs. Having come this far I am not about to leave anything to chance... it shouldn’t take me long to find and deal with these *inquisitive students*.
- In the meantime, I ask that as well as Garron, you also instruct Sebastian in use of the leveller. It would be good to have two persons capable of deploying it in case one or the other becomes incapacitated in any way, and as this is your project, who better than yourself to instruct them. 
- Call me over cautious if you want but I have changed the ward on the door to the room in the sewers, just in case we have been infiltrated by Ulcaster spies. I doubt spies would have cause to go down into the sewers but I still prefer to err on the side of caution. The second letter that he will give to you explains how you may open the door to the leveller. 
- If I don’t see you before you leave for Ulcaster, let me wish you luck and I will see you when you return victorious.

Jhadros lived a contented life among the nomadic tribes of the High Desert in The Land Of Fate... that was until Fate took a hand and his sweetheart Sikayah, caught the eye of the Grand Caliph of the city of Huzuz known as *The City of Delights*. Sikayah was secreted away into the Caliph’s palace, where she was to learn the ways of life in the harem and become the old Caliph’s new wife.
-
-Knowing that he had very little time to save Sikaya from the marriage, Jhadros travelled to the north western city of Quadib, a magical city and home to mages, sorcerers, genies and the like. There he sought out the elemental wind mage Zarad, who after one year service, fashioned this cloak for Jhadros, imbuing it with powerful magical properties.
-
-Jhadros returned to Huzuz armed with his magical cloak and the powerful wind spells that Zarad had taught him, he entered The Great Palace on a magical Wind Carpet and whisked Sikaya away. Knowing that honour would warrant their deaths, Jhadros and his sweetheart fled  Zakhara. It isn’t known to where the lovers fled, nor their manner of escape. Some say Jhadros secured passage for them aboard a merchant ship, whilst others say they escaped aboard one of the spelljammer vessels that had been seen docked at Huzuz.

 Multiple magic incendiary missiles are conjured at the completion of this spell. Only the caster may handle a conjured sunstone. The stone strikes as a +3 weapon, and up to 5 such stones can be discharged per round after the initial casting. When hurled at a target creature, the missile explodes with a globe of fire, causing 6D4 points of fire damage to the target creature. The wizard gains one sunstone for every 3 levels he has attained (e.g. 5 at level 15, 6 at level 18, and 7 at level 21).

-
-An *Eye Bite* spell enables the caster to merely meet the gaze of a creature and speak a single word to cause an effect. This gaze attack is in addition to any other attacks allowed to the wizard. The wizard selects one of four possible gaze attacks at the time the spell is cast, and this attack cannot be changed. Any gaze attack is negated by a successful saving throw vs. spell, with wisdom adjustments. The four effects of the spell are as follows:
-
-Fear: The victim flees in blind terror for 1d4 rounds, after which the creature will cower or bolt for cower if confronted by the caster for 1 round/level of caster. This effect can be negated by spells that counter fear.
-
-Charm: This effect makes the victim loyal to the caster even to the point of personal damage, otherwise it is the same as a charm monster spell. All creatures other than humans, demi-humans, and humanoid save with a +2 bonus.
-
-Sicken: This effect causes sudden pain and fever to sweep over the victims body. Creatures with ability scores function at one-half effectiveness, others inflict only one-half damage with physical attacks. All movement rate is halved. The effect lasts for 1 round/level of the caster and can only be negated by a Remove Curse or a Dispel Magic spell. Abilities return at the rate or 1 point/round of complete rest. Creatures save same as the charm effect.
-
-Sleep: This effect causes an individual to fall into a comatose slumber unless a successful save vs. spells is made. Creatures normally subject to a first level Sleep spell save with a -2 penalty. An effected creature must be shaken or shocked back to consciousness. Undead are immune to this effect.

-  SAY DESC ~Properly a hat, not a helm, the Dominant is a wizardly item of impressive power.  The wizard Bemban of Immersea was known to be quite fond of these pointed hats both for their appearance and their power.  Many wizards sought their own Dominants, but their distinctive appearance soon became the butt of many jokes among adventurers.  Bemban grew senile in his later years, and left most of his fortune to private mages in the hope that they would continue to make his favorite magical hat.

Any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180 degree arc.

The effect of this is to protect the caster from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. The skins will remain until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect Accalia from any area attacks such as fireball, however it will protect her from physical magical attacks such as magic missile.~

-SAY ~This kit was created especially for Accalia. Tempus is the Realms’ God of War, the Lord of Battle, the Foehammer. He is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. He may be on an army’s side on one day and against them the next. Such is the nature of war as embodied by Tempus.
-
-The dress of the priest of Tempus is armor, battle-worn and battered. In more civilized regions this has been replaced by a steel skullcap, but the message is the same--these are warrior priests. Their place is in the trenches with the troops, urging them onwards. Priests of Tempus may be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know who the war god will favor.

-Abilities:
-
-- ‘Spiritual Hammer‘ (thrice per day), the magic weapon without non-proficiency penalties strikes with a bonus of +2 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +6 enchantment level, +6 to the attack roll and +6 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster, the base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is 2d4 + 3 vs. opponents plus the magical bonus.
-- ‘Tempus Will‘ (twice per day) imbues the caster with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level, so the priest’s strength is set to 18/00, even if it is normally higher, his THAC0 becomes that of a fighter of the same level, and he gains 1 temporary hit point for every level he has attained.
-- ‘Tempus Shield‘ (twice per day) creates an invisible rotating through a 180 degree arc disk that protects the caster in a way that any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction.
-- ‘Iron Skin‘ (once a day), the magical outer skin of iron moves up from the ground completely covering Accalia without hindering her in any way, protecting from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. Accalia gains an additional skin for every two levels, and for each skin she possesses, the spell will stop one attack.
-- ‘False Dawn‘(thrice per day) calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, affecting all undead creatures within the area of effect so they suffer 6d6 points of damage and act confused on the round with no saving throw against this damage.
--  Can only be of True Neutral, or any Chaotic alignments.~

Accalia is happy to tell you of any of these rituals and local battle lore, but when you ask her to tell of the battle of Gerard‘s Stone, she will tell you to ask Everard as he prefers to tell of it himself.

-	SAY NAME2 ~Wind of Heaven~
-  SAY DESC ~Shaped by a powerful djinn sorcerer on the Elemental Plane of Air, the Wind of Heaven was a gift for the Caliph of Tamjuhk. The Caliph claimed it was the finest weapon he had ever held. When Tamjuhk was sacked by efreeti, githyanki, salamanders, and other malicious creatures, the efreeti Amir Talmed presented the weapon to the Grand Sultan of the city of Brass. Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

However, a series of six poems about the search for and attainment of wisdom divide the book into something resembling chapters, although the divisions are not thematically based. Upon browsing the first part of the book, you reveal that it is essentially a collection of ethical teachings. The teachings are applicable to all conditions of life: to parents and children, to husbands and wives, to the young, to masters, to friends, to the rich, and to the poor. Many of them are rules of courtesy and politeness; and a still greater number contain advice and instruction as to the duties of man toward himself and others, especially the poor, as well as toward society.~

The standard of good and the reason for good conduct is existing law, custom, and individual eudaemonistics. Modern social philosophies developing concurrently in Faerun, by contrast, encourage good behavior for the health of the state, families, or from fear of reprisal, while the Book of Wisdom notes that punishment may follow from poor choices, the laws should be followed because they are ordained by the gods. Wisdom is represented as the result of human reflection, and thus as the guide in all the affairs of life but predetermination of good and evil remains the gods' prerogative. The wisdom texts emphasize human powers as bestowed directly by the gods.~

It has multiple enchantments that all become activated when the claw is worn as a ring. The image of the wearer become blurred and more difficult to hit with weapons or target with spells.  It has one drawback however, as it seems to fuel its power with the blood of its wearer. Because of this, the wearer of the claw will often be more sickly and therefore more susceptible to poisons.

-
-This spell is similar to the invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character‘s saving throws are made with a +4 bonus.

-Note: after making an attack the caster is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the mage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

-
-When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~

-(Evocation) 
-Level: 1
-Range: 30 yards 
-Duration: special 
-Casting Time: 1 
-Area of Effect: One creature
-Saving Throw: Special

-This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster‘s hand.  When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target.  The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the mage who casts the spell.  Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. spells at +6.  At first-level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and blinds the target for one round.  At second-level, the sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and inflicts pain upon the victim.  At third-level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and burns the victim.  At fourth-level, the sphere deals 1-6 damage and blinds the target for 1 turn.  At fifth-level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.  At sixth-level, the sphere deals 1-8 damage and causes weakness in the victim.  At seventh level, the sphere deals 1-10 damage and paralyzes the victim for 2 turns.  At 10th level, the sphere causes 1-12 acid damage and turns the victim to stone.  At 12th level, the sphere will inflict 2-16 points of acid damage and instantly kill the victim.  
-NOTE: The victim saves vs spells at +6 against all the effects and gets no save against the damage.~

-  SAY BIO ~Taffic was born into a clan of prolific forest gnomes living in Cloakwood Forest. Your first impression of Taffic is that he is as he seems, a happy-go-lucky forest gnome with small eyes that have a hint of mischief about them.

-  SAY DESC ~Covered almost entirely with finely carved images of all manner of insects, this stout stave was fashioned for the gnome illusionist Garp Van Vechten... hence it is somewhat shorter in length than the normal stave. Garp adventured for many years with his human druid friend Diederik. Together they fought and won many battles. Garp, although a brilliant illusionist was himself wary when confronting other magic users in battle. He knew only too well the advantage a mage, well stocked with high level destructive magic had over him, but with the help of one particular spell that his friend always kept in reserve for such encounters... the druid spell of *Insect Plague... Garp very quickly lost his fear of  magic users and their spells. Once cast, Garp would watch gleefully as their opponents writhed in agony, their spells lost due to the scratching, biting and stinging of the plague, allowing his own magic to quickly take them down. Unfortunately a human is not blessed with the long lifespan of a gnome so before he died, Diederik enchanted this staff for his friend, giving it the ability to cast the spell he hoped would aid him against magic users when he no longer could. It is thought to be the only one of its kind in existence to date.

-  SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~My dear Deidre,
-	        I am sorry I can not be here for your visit but I have left this letter with Carialie. Regards your question of the possibility of altering a person’s race, I know of only one person wise enough to have the answer that you seek. He and I travelled extensively together in our youth and before that he had seen many wonders that I could only dream of. 
-                  I recall a story he once told me that he and another were witness to. A story of a young dwarf who was unfortunate enough to fall in love with an eleven girl. This dwarf  sought far and wide for the knowledge to make himself of the elven race, and it just so happens he happened upon the sorcerer Aldruis at the same time that my friend was visiting the sorcerer himself. If the story is true, and I have no reason to doubt the word of my friend, that young dwarf left Aldruis’s abode a young sprightly elven male. 
-                This friend of mine is none other than the conjurer Thalantyr, and he can be found living on the outskirts of Beregost. I can not guarantee that he will impart any of his knowledge to your gnome friend as he has become somewhat of a recluse of late and is very particular with whom he converses... some might even call him arrogant. 
-                I hope this is of some use to you and please Deidre, don’t leave it so long next time between visits. Carialie and myself always look forward to and enjoy having you stay with us.

He and his company, Kerrn's Breakers, hired themselves out to all sorts of warlords, bandits, wizards, and religious leaders.  They were typically placed at the front of the battlefield where they would intercept charging heavy cavalry units and break their formation.  Kerrn died in 1054 DR when he accidentally killed the horse of a heavily armored foe.  The horse fell on top of Kerrn, killing him.  In the madness of the battle that followed, most of his comrades were routed.

-This portion of the Deep has been a pleasant surprise, to say the least.  Not only do the ancient dwarven deterrents provide me much seclusion for my work, I have gained the ability to have their spirits become my unwilling servants in knowledge.  Soon I will begin my final transcendence, and my ascended existence within this region will ensure that my power is without challenge.  My new minions, unable to ever find their peace as long as my thoughts occupy what is left of their minds.

-Morning Twenty-Three
-
-A curious experience today.  I finally managed to open the door to Jamoth‘s tomb, and upon entering I was overcome with fatigue.  At first I felt as though I may have unintentionally sprung a trap, but upon revisiting the tomb later I discounted that possibility.  I felt as though life itself was leaving my body, and twisting my coherence.  I will need to investigate this room further in the future, and exercise caution.  I feel as though there may be something within those chambers that would challenge my occupation of these halls.
-
-
-Morning Twenty-Six
-
-I have given up attempting to open the door to Wyrm‘s Tooth.  I‘d hoped to have visited the area to gather some necessities for my rite of passage, but it appears to be impossible to move the door in any way without its key.  I know from my readings of the lore scattered about here that the key was placed in or around the dwarven monument outside of the cemetery, but its hiding place appears to be impossible to find in the forge‘s current state.  I‘m afraid that without certain resources, the process will render me weaker than I‘d originally intended, but I appear to have no choice but to use what I have.~

-
-
-  Arriving at Dorn‘s Deep in the middle of the night did not lead to a warm welcome by the dwarves, especially with what had come to past between both our races.  As expected, the dwarves were very apprehensive to what I had to say.  There were too many fresh and open wounds between both our people.  Situations like this are never easy but I consider myself as good a diplomat as father, perhaps better.   
-
-  Each day spent in council did not end until late evening and always in pure exhaustion.  We argued and bickered over the recent past events.  Although we still continued to spend countless hours in council, the dwarves began to trust that I hid no maliciousness behind my words.  The dwarves agreed to a treaty in the name of the greater good for both our races later that week.  I had been successful in my part.  I saw hope for the first time in many months.  
-
-  The only thing left was to return home and convince my own people that this was our only chance at true salvation.  The hardest part would be to convince father but he will listen.  He must listen; else let our people face death.
-
-  The next morning almost made the last few weeks‘ work in vain.  A dwarven scout arrived and told of the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away.  With little time to prepare, our defenses were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn‘s Deep. 
-
-  We began our retreat into the depths of Dorn‘s Deep.   Key passages were collapsed to cover our movements and buy us time.  Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where we would fight.  Every battle cost the orcs dearly as the dwarves fought on their terms but we were still being driven farther and farther back.  Even now, we make preparations to retreat further into Wyrm‘s Tooth Glacier.
-
-  Even as grim as this sounds, I still hold hope.  Hope that I will tell father of how I fought side by side with our dwarven friends as in days of old.  Hope that he will hear the tales of the dwarves who sacrificed their lives so that I may return home someday to reunite both our people.  Hope to see my father‘s stubborn face once again.

When troubles arose between the Hand of the Seldarine and Dorn‘s Deep, the dwarves locked the armor in a vault, refusing to use anything the elves had a hand in creating.

The three elves made a pact to avenge their kin in ten years time.  The subsequent adventures of the trio were immortalized in Merador of Waterdeep's epic "Three Avengers" ballads.  The songs, sixteen in number, tell all of the adventures that the group went on.  From the Ballad of the Goblin King to the Ballad of Green Night, every deed is retold.  Unfortunately, the history of Galain's gauntlets end with the final bars of Green Night.  The rest is shrouded in mystery.

When he was a young man, he set off for the city to hire himself out as a mercenary.  After a number of successful endeavors, Kheros became a short-term member of many adventuring companies.  Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.
-
-His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness.  Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safe-keeping.  The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear.  Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest.  His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned.  All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched or tried to escape.  In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

Before Ilban, however, Valiant was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara. According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins. Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

-	SAY NAME2 ~The Salamander's Tongue~
-	SAY DESC ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers.  The blade appears to be an exotic looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points.  A small portion of a slimy, bright red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip.  It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner.  
-
-The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill.  Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers.  Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound.  Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination.  Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam, and was killed by Deder's agents within the month.  Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it.  He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate.  The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside.  Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.
-
-In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar.  Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an Amulet of Non-Detection.  The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen.  Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia.  The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

Matthain's family, Chamberlain, had a long tradition of producing paladins of Tyr.  Matthain's father, Garlan, slew a powerful high priest of Bane who had been posing a threat to the kingdom.  The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead.  This priest, called "The Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased.  Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.
-
-Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across.  He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed.  The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe.  Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights.  He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse.  The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.
-
-Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear.  With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

-  SAY NAME2 ~Pale Justice~
-  SAY DESC ~This sword was made with one purpose: to destroy evil. Though a powerful weapon, Pale Justice has humble beginnings. The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold. Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade.
-
-As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr. The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar. He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power.
-
-The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it. After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence.
-
-Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr. Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade. It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.
-
-The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses. Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time. He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago. The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword.
-
-The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls. Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso. The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke: "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods. Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison."
-
-Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon. The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon. He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.
-
-"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power. I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility. Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant. It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."
-
-Edan took the blade to a local weapon smith and had him put a wooden, leather wrapped grip on it. He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

Thirty years later, mind flayers destroyed the hook horrors and took the dagger back to their community. The merchant Nym traded deep gnome slaves to the mind flayers in exchange for the dagger, which was eventually sold to Malavon.

Exceptionally light and beautiful, the armor was originally worn by a female elven marshal in the Severed Hand, which is why the orcs didn't take it when they sacked the towers. The armor was later stolen from the Hand by Maiden Ilmadia.

-  SAY DESC ~This long sword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion.  Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical long sword blade and features a thin fuller down the center.  Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated towards the hilt.  The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two off-white pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow.  The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire.  The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.
-
-The full history of this blade and its brother have been well documented.  Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril.  Obren reluctantly did so, producing Alamion ("Frost Daddy") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five year period.  After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force.  The exact outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful.  Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons in a single strike.  Berdino was found dead on the shore two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.
-
-The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair.  Pellas had acquired Malamion, quite by accident, fourteen years earlier and strongly desired its brother when he learned of its existence.  Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of a paladin named Garijon Renold of Torm.  Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes and the two swords were passed on for generations from paladin to paladin.
-
-Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords.  His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.

Legends say that Herren of Umberlee used the shield's sanctuary to attack and destroy a number of elementals before the water lord Ishtishia shifted the priest to the paraelemental plane of ice, where he froze to death.  From there, it is believed that the shield floated around the planes for many years, only recently resurfacing in Faerun.

-  SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~The broad sword is a heavy military sword with a double-edged blade.  Overall sword length is about three and one-half feet, and the sword is designed mostly for cutting.  Most broad swords have a basket hilt or a shell guard.  A favored cavalry weapon, the broad sword is known in different cultures by different names, usually dependant on the hilt configuration.  The heavier blade of the broad sword makes it slightly slower and more damaging than a long sword.~ 
-  SAY DESC ~This sword, an oddity amonst elves who normally prefer lighter blades, the original Greycloak owner passed this owneron after years of service. Kethryllia Amaranthine reforged this sword 1221 DR for Erevain Blacksheaf's initiation to the Evereskan Greycloaks. It has since been significantly enhanced because Erevain requested this sword be heavier, more damaging and grants numerous protections. It was later redecorated to openly display the Blacksheaf family crest.
