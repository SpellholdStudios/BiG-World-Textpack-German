@2    = ~What kind of answer are you expecting from me?~
@3    = ~There is no need to talk. Die!~
@4    = ~My death has nothing to do with you, child of Bhaal.~
@5    = ~Because, whether I die or not, when I get to gauge your power, we won't have any reason to meet any more.~
@6    = ~If this is the answer you expected, I expect information that you have hidden power.~
@7    = ~I am still looking for ways to improve my skills, and if you are more powerful than I expected, there will be more opportunities to improve myself.~
@8    = ~How did you appear again? That thing before was not you?~
@9    = ~Well, that thing before could be me, or not.~
@10   = ~However, in my opinion, that is not important. What is important is that I think you are stronger than expected and now the battle will be a little different.~
@11   = ~This body is my avatar. A superior avatar to show part of my abilities.~
@12   = ~This will be different from the previous trials. Now, we will have a more interesting conversation.~
