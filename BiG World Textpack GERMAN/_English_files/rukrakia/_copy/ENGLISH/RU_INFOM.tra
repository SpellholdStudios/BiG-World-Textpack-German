@0   = ~Oh, Oh, you are the famous Bhaalspawn! I found you! Finally found you!~
@1   = ~What, what is this?~
@2   = ~What is all the fuss? Do you have any business with me?~
@3   = ~Now that you found out who I am, you realize you have to die, too.~
@4   = ~You don't know how lucky I am to meet you! Please help me. My story will change your mind.~
@5   = ~I am being hunted down. I used to track down legendary ruins hidden in the southern desert with my friends.~
@6   = ~Have you heard of Raigen, the legendary knight, and his tomb? That's disappointing. You don't seem to recognize the name.~
@7   = ~He lived a thousand years ago! He was a great hero! A great knight who fought the enemy with the Sword of Thunder, producing thunders!~
@8   = ~Keep talking.~
@9   = ~That's boring. I am leaving.~
@10  = ~Good! Raigen, the Thunder Bringer, defeated numerous evil forces, but disappeared on his last journey.~
@11  = ~Don't be surprised. The destination of the last journey was the southern desert. That's why my friends and I went to find Raigen's tomb there...~
@12  = ~After a thousand years, we found the ruins of his grave, That was indescribable! We were half crazed with joy.~
@13  = ~It took us more than a month to dig around the tomb. Around the time we could see the outlines of the tomb, one of my friends betrayed us. That bastard!!~
@14  = ~It was Elber. He sold the information to a local baron. The baron started killing us to silence us. Realizing this, we got away, far from each other.~
@15  = ~I thought I should tell everyone about the tomb since I might lose my dream and get killed by the baron. I am sure others who survived are doing the same thing, giving away the information about the tomb.~
@16  = ~So, you want me to protect you?~
@17  = ~I am not interested in the tomb. I am leaving.~
@18  = ~Sure! I would be forever grateful if s strong guy like you protects me. But I don't think you would do that for nothing.~
@19  = ~I just want you to be interested in this case and ruin the baron's plan. Exploring the ruins is my lifelong dream, I am not going back to the tomb, now that it is a battle ground for greedy people.~
@20  = ~Elber has the map to the tomb. He is in Amkethran. Please I beg you. Kill that bastard. I am sure you will have to anyway to take away the map. That is all I ask you.~
@21  = ~And... eh.. eh?~
@22  = ~Damn! If you want to leave, I won't stop you. I will find someone interested in this.~
@23  = ~Oh, no. If I had known you were such an ass, I wouldn't have looked for you. Why do you think I want to fight you??~
