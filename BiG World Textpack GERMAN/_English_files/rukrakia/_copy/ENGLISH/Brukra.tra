@0    = ~Thank you so much for saving me, <CHARNAME>. I don't know how to repay you...~ [RukraM1]
@1    = ~Be my slave!~
@2    = ~Stop fooling around. I have a long way to go.~
@3    = ~We should not turn our backs to those in need. Don't worry about it.~
@4    = ~Wha, what? How...~
@5    = ~Of course I am kidding! Ha-ha! I am just joking because you looked depressed!~
@6    = ~I will forgive you if you become mine for one night.~
@7    = ~I am shocked! You are being absurd!~
@8    = ~Sorry if I shocked you. I didn't mean to.~
@9    = ~Yours...?! Oh no, I can't believe my saviour is a sex maniac...!!~ 
@10   = ~Ha! You are not in a position to negotiate!~
@11   = ~I will protect you. Hehehe. Shall we go?~
@12   = ~Of course. I know how important a promise is.~
@13   = ~You devil! You disappoint me and make me lose hope!~
@14   = ~(She faltered, her eyes shining with tears, as if her heart was breaking. To her, it seems like the best strategy to trust <CHARNAME> to protect herself.)~
@15   = ~It will be a good choice. For both of us.~
@16   = ~I am sorry. I said something silly. I will keep my mouth shut.~
@17   = ~(She lets out a big sigh as if relieved. To <CHARNAME>, she seems to be worried about something, but he says nothing)~
@18   = ~I have to rescue Imoen. She was kidnapped by Cowled Wizards. We don't know what kind of danger she might be facing.~
@19   = ~My debt to you is much bigger than this. If you can protect me from them, I will always help you.~
@20   = ~(She changed her bloody underwear from the violent encounter with <CHARNAME>. She frowns. Her eyes show conflicting emotions.)~
@21   = ~I am leaving. Don't forget your promise that you will protect me.~
@22   = ~Sure. By the way, I didn't tell you this. I am trying to rescue Imoen who was kidnapped by Cowled Wizards.~
@23   = ~Imoen? Who is she?~
@24   = ~She is my step sister. She and I grew up together in Candlekeep. Saving her might be dangerous.~
@25   = ~Your job is to try to save me from them. I don't care about anything else. Let's hurry.~ 
@26   = ~I am afraid these days that they might come. I am indebted to you already, and I am afraid I am becoming a burden to you...~ [RukraM1]
@27   = ~Stop bothering me. I am busy.~
@28   = ~Like you said before, stay here. I will protect you.~
@29   = ~Don't worry, Miss Ruke. I am sure this is confusing. I am protecting you only out of good will. You don't have to worry about repaying me.~
@30   = ~I am sorry. Maybe I am being silly. I should be responsible for myself...~
@31   = ~You are being a big comfort to me. Thank you so much...~
@32   = ~How can you be... so good? I... was not so good to you...~
@33   = ~I am sorry if I scared you. I won't next time.~
@34   = ~(Sighing quietly.) Oh... no...~
@35   = ~Sorry about lying about my name. What I told you before is true. I didn't want them to find us right away...~ [RukraM1]
@36   = ~Of course. I understand.~
@37   = ~This is about trust. We should not lie to each other, if you want my help.~
@38   = ~(She smiles a little and looks more comfortable, as if she was relieved.)~
@39   = ~Sure! Tell me. I am always open to our party members.~
@40   = ~Let's talk about it later. It is a virtue to talk less.~
@41   = ~Thank you. The name Sezar, they used to call me before, is not my real name. I got the name from the organization after I started living there.~
@42   = ~Right. The woman I know is not Saint Akira, but Rukrakia. It won't change.~
@43   = ~Huh, aren't you being too serious? (She laughs)~
@44   = ~I am sorry, but I don't think it is necessary. Let's go then.~
@45   = ~I am really sorry... I will never lie to you. Please forgive me this time...~
@46   = ~No, no, don't take this too seriously. What's important is the future, not your mistakes in the past.~
@47   = ~Stop it. I don't want to talk to you anymore. You will have to earn forgiveness yourself.~
@48   = ~Thank you. I will not lie again.~
@49   = ~What do you mean? It's not your real name?~
@50   = ~Sorry. I am really sorry...~
@51   = ~(Asking with bright eyes.) Don't you want to know about my abilities?~ [RukraM3]
@52   = ~No, I am not that interested.~
@53   = ~Of course I am interested. I was waiting for you to tell me.~
@54   = ~Oh, I understand. Sorry for the delay.~
@55   = ~You don't have to be formal with me. You are the leader of the party. You should talk to me like you would to other party members.~
@56   = ~Hmm, OK, Ruke... I thought you might be more comfortable with a formal tone, but if you feel that way.~ 
@57   = ~You know that I trained in magical craft of Kara-Tur? One of the trainings I got as a kid was to reach the ultimate state of The indestructible Super Meta structure. That was to soak my body in a mixture of various strange materials.~
@58   = ~The process took 30 days. As my skin absorbed all the materials, my body became hard and this spot under my belly button became very hot. Then my body can store the heat inside my body and it becomes invincible against outer impacts.~
@59   = ~Wow, that's amazing! Then your senses are?~
@60   = ~No! I still feel pain. It is very important for my body to be sensitive to the outer stimulations.~ 
@61   = ~Hmm sensitive... Mm-mm~
@62   = ~(Red in the face.) Ewe! Are you having dirty thoughts again?~
@63   = ~Never! I have Brother Keeper!~
@64   = ~Brother keeper? Who is it?~
@65   = ~This is a secret between you and me. Listen carefully. He is bigger and more beautiful than you can ever imagine.~
@66   = ~What!!! Are you kidding me? Perv!~
@67   = ~Tell me about yourself. I want to know.~ [RukraM3]
@68   = ~I don't want to talk. Stop asking. You are bothering me.~
@69   = ~This might surprise you, but actually I am a descendant of Bhaal.~
@70   = ~Bhaal? Who is it?~
@71   = ~Wow, amazing! You don't know Bhaal? God in charge of death, god of death and murder.~
@72   = ~What? You are teasing me? I only trained in martial arts when I was young. You can ask me about the mystic arts of Kara-Tur. I am going to cry, if you keep making fun of my ignorance in other subjects.~
@73   = ~I am sorry that I keep bothering you. I won't from now on.~
@74   = ~Right princess. I will be careful from now on. Bah-hah-hah.~
@75   = ~Ewe! (Pinching <CHARNAME>'s side.) Then you descended from the god of murder. That sounds like a big story... How can a mortal be a god's descendant? Isn't god immortal?~
@76   = ~In this world, god is never immortal, except AO, the absolute god. Bhaal became mortal after the historical incident called the Time of Troubles, and started spreading his offspring. He died but his descendants remain.~
@77   = ~OK, no matter what, you are you, right? I hope the burden of being a god's descendant was easy enough for you.~
@78   = ~Did I tell you about my organization?~ [RukraM1]
@79   = ~No, you didn't. Tell me.~
@80   = ~Your old organization? Isn't it history?~ 
@81   = ~You should stop talking. Let's have a quiet journey.~
@82   = ~I am sorry. I will be quiet.~
@83   = ~I hope so, but I don't think so. Only some of the storm guards came and even though Sezar, one of the top priests, died, there are others, still strong.~
@84   = ~I am not sure if they have given up on me. They haven't come yet, but I won't let my guard down.~
@85   = ~The one who Sezar called Master is the head of the organization. The name of the cult is Harmonic Shadow. They are a religious cult that worships shadows.~
@86   = ~That is great. It will be tough if those people keep attacking us.~
@87   = ~That is no problem. I am a celebrity. I took care of iron deficiency in Baldur's Gate. I am quite famous, really.~
@88   = ~Right. It will be difficult. I know you are strong but it still makes me nervous when I think of their power.~
@89   = ~(She tries to smile but she looks disturbed.) I don't know what iron deficiency is, but I am aware of your power. I hope there are no problems...~
@90   = ~I am not sure if they have given up on me. Only part of the storm guards came and even though Sezar, one of the top priests, died, others are still strong.~
@91   = ~Don't you want to know how to open Dimension Door?~ [RukraM3]
@92   = ~Of course I do! Is it part of Kara-Tur's martial art?~
@93   = ~No, not at all. I hope you would stop talking to me.~
@94   = ~Really? Are you going to tell me? Can you tell me?~
@95   = ~(Pouting.) Huh! Do you think Kara-Tur's mystic arts are omnipotent? It can't be! This is also something I learned from Harmonic Shadow, but not part of Kara-Tur's magic.~
@96   = ~If it is not part of the mystic arts, is it a wizard spell??~
@97   = ~Yes, it is a shortcut. Do you see the letter circling my wrists. They are the answer. When I concentrate to put the warm energy in my navel to my arms, the letters respond to the energy and open the Dimension Door.~
@98   = ~This does not work by just writing the letters. You have to have enough energy in your navel and you should have a strong mental power to concentrate the energy on your arms even in emergencies.~
@99   = ~The problem is that all the storm guards and crusaders have this ability. This ability is very dangerous and very effective, when they are following someone in the shadow or tracking someone.~
@100  = ~OK. But since they haven't come yet, maybe they have given up on you?~
@101  = ~Oh, I hope so. Maybe I am worried for nothing?~
@102  = ~(She turns her head as if mad.) OK, I will stop making conversation.~
@103  = ~Are you jealous? Even if I wanted to tell you, I couldn't.~
@104  = ~Really? Not that you don't want to tell me?~
@105  = ~What? Is that what you think of our relationship? I put you in charge of my safety. If I could have taught you this ability, I would have a long time ago. I am disappointed towards you. Humph (pouting as if mad.)~
@106  = ~I am kidding! Of course we are much closer than that! Hahaha!~
@107  = ~What? I can't win this game! Now, look! (She shows her wrists to <CHARNAME>.)~
@108  = ~What! You want to go holding hands so that the whole world can see how close we are?~ 
@109  = ~It's a rune. So you are using this?~ 
@110  = ~What! If you keep making fun of me, I will cry. Be prepared!~
@111  = ~No, no. I am sorry. Ha-ha. So you open the Dimension Door with these runes?~
@112  = ~(She gives a big sigh and nods.) Yes, it is kind of. Do you see the letters drawn on my bracers? They are the answer. When I concentrate to put the warm energy in my navel to my arms, the letters respond to the energy and open the Dimension Door.~
@113  = ~Have you thought of the future ahead?~ [RukraM1]
@114  = ~Your future? My future? Or our future?~
@115  = ~I haven't. The further the future moves away, the more we try to get to know it...~
@116  = ~That is a useless idea. Let's just continue with the journey and stop bothering me.~
@117  = ~Oh please... I want to know your future. If you tell me, I will tell you later.~
@118  = ~My future... frankly, I haven't thought about my future. When I was growing up in Candlekeep, I always had to face many adventures, since my step father, Gorion, died. I couldn't afford to think, or look ahead.~
@119  = ~(<CHARNAME> keeps talking, looking into her dark eyes, wondering if he has ever told anyone about himself.)~
@120  = ~After my work in Baldur's Gate was finished, I came to Amn through the Sword Coast. Coming to Amn had nothing to do with my will or intention. I was dragged here, according to Irenicus' plan. I still don't know why. I still feel that I am under his will. My future is... still very unclear.~
@121  = ~(She shakes her head, as if she wanted to deny what <CHARNAME> says.)~
@122  = ~Thank you Ruke. You don't seem to realize this, but I am very lucky to have you.~
@123  = ~Right. I am a powerful man. Hahaha!~
@124  = ~(She answers, blushing a little.) Are you telling me you like me? You are kidding, Right? You scared me.~
@125  = ~(She yells as if she were disappointed.) What! You pretended to be serious and make fun of me! Huh! I am an idiot!~
@126  = ~Hmmm, the further it gets away from you, the more you try to find out about it... What does it mean? It sounds philosophical.~
@127  = ~Philosophical? Philosophy gives you a headache. This is not such a heavy subject. I just wanted to say that we accept reality, not truth. Therefore, we predict the future, only based on reality, and since reality is not truth, the more we try to predict our future, the further we get away from truth.~
@128  = ~What! You are beating around the bushes. So, when you predict the future based on false facts, it only results in lies? Therefore it is meaningless to think about the future?~
@129  = ~No, it does have a meaning. We live our reality. In fact, I just made it up because I didn't know what to say. Hahaha.~
@130  = ~What? I wanted to tell you about my future plans, if you tell me about yours. Is there a reason why you don't want to share your plans?~
@131  = ~Ummm... Frankly, I haven't thought about my future, so I had nothing to say. When I was growing up in Candlekeep, I always had to face many adventures, since my step father, Gorion, died. I couldn't afford to look ahead.~
@132  = ~I am sorry to bother you. I will be careful next time. Huh!~
@133  = ~I told you before that I will tell you about my future plans if you tell me about yours? It's my turn, now.~ [RukraM3]
@134  = ~I don't want to hear it! Shut up!~
@135  = ~Right. I forgot. Now I remember.~
@136  = ~I was waiting for you.~
@137  = ~(She falters as if she were shocked.)~
@138  = ~Oh, you don't care for me any more... OK, I will stop...~
@139  = ~Eh, you forgot or you don't have a lot of expectations for my story? Do you even want to hear it?~
@140  = ~Sure. Go ahead.~
@141  = ~No, I don't want to hear it.~
@142  = ~Why?~
@143  = ~I don't want to listen to your stories anymore.~
@144  = ~(She falters as if she were shocked. Then she turns around and says to herself.)~
@145  = ~*Huh* I want to break something...~
@146  = ~What you told me last time... I thought about it... when our journey is over, I want to visit Baldur's Gate.~
@147  = ~Baldur's Gate?~
@148  = ~Yes. I want to see Candlekeep where you grew up, what The Sword Coast looks like... How is Baldur's Gate, I want to look at the place and get a feel of the place. I want to see your footsteps.~ 
@149  = ~(Suddenly blushing.) Don't, don't misunderstand me... I am just curious how the places made you powerful... Ummm... I want to know about your past, too...~
@150  = ~And... I hope you will come with me. And we can be famous there together! What do you think?~
@151  = ~That is not a bad idea!~
@152  = ~Hmm! You are telling me you like me?~
@153  = ~Right? He-he, I actually put some thought into this idea!~
@154  = ~Wha... what...! You are teasing me! (She turns away, blushing.)~
@155  = ~Have I told you about when I lived in Calimshan?~ [RukraM3]
@156  = ~No, you haven't.~
@157  = ~Well, you know where Calimshan is, right? I was born in the north part. Meer Forest stretches along the huge plains under the mountain.~
@158  = ~I grew up there with my sister Milte. I was young, so I don't remember my parents.~
@159  = ~My family was poor so, my parents were working all the time and Milte and I ran around the mountain, playing.~
@160  = ~Huh, as you probably know, Milte was a strange child. She surprised people all the time with her intelligence.~
@161  = ~Besides, she tried to act like my big sister. She was so cute. I thought she was going to be a wizard. She was too talented to spend her life in the small village.~
@162  = ~When I was seven and she was six, I was kidnapped. She was hiding, but watching me. I thought I would never see her.~
@163  = ~But no. She came to kidnap me and I recognized her. That's why I was taken by surprise.~
@164  = ~She was all grown up. I thought she was older than me. She looked like an elf.~
@165  = ~Huh! She didn't change. The authoritative tone of voice, that confidence, the same Milte I knew before.~
@166  = ~Milte explained to me what happened, before she took me to Harmonic Shadow. Ah, she was so smart. She gave me the potion to protect my spirit and that protected me against Amildar's potion.~
@167  = ~Milte prepared some traps in case you don't come, but I trusted you and told her we should wait..~
@168  = ~Milte didn't agree with me, but eventually she gave in, as she always did when we were young. That made me almost cry.~
@169  = ~She was the nice girl I knew from our childhood. She wanted to be cool and calculating, so she got riled up if I called her nice. But I knew that it was good will that made up her personality. She was so enduring when she blushed.~
@170  = ~I wanted to see her blushing, hahaha, but she was too proud.~
@171  = ~Huh! She could not tell you she liked you. I think she liked you. She was very formal and awkward around others.~
@172  = ~Still, I didn't want to lose you to her! Huh you are very lucky. She liked you.~
@173  = ~No! You are the only one! Mmmm!~
@174  = ~Are you just saying it? Convince me.~
@175  = ~(She comes to <CHARNAME> and closes her eyes.)~
@176  = ~(He kisses her passionately.)~
@177  = ~(He kisses her on the cheek.)~
@178  = ~(He grabs her cheek and stretches it.)~
@179  = ~Hmmm, you are quite skilled at this!~
@180  = ~What! You think I am a kid?~
@181  = ~(She comes to <CHARNAME> and steals a kiss and laughs.)~
@182  = ~Eeckk! Stop it!~
@183  = ~Hehehe!~
@184  = ~I miss her... (Her eyes get red.)~ [RukraM1]
@185  = ~Don't cry. It wasn't your fault.~
@186  = ~It was all my fault. I killed her.~
@187  = ~No, I was the one who let her die. *Crying*~
@188  = ~I was so helpless, I let her die.~
@189  = ~Maybe, you are right. Harmonic shadow killed her. I was there. She was there herself. We are all responsible, not just you.~
@190  = ~Bu... but...~
@191  = ~What but? It wasn't just your fault. It was everybody's fault. Don't take all the responsibility. Stop blaming yourself. Blame others.~
@192  = ~(She barely nods under <CHARNAME> pressure.)~
@193  = ~(But her heart is empty, and the question keeps coming back.....)~
@194  = ~I am sure your heart breaks the most and that is why you feel more responsible. But I think you need someone to comfort you. Stop hurting, Ruke.~
@195  = ~(She cries and lets <CHARNAME> hold her.)~
@196  = ~I am sorry I made you worry. I think I just needed someone to feel sorry for me.~
@197  = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@198  = ~It still worries me. Harmonic Shadow is not destroyed yet. We didn't even come close to destroying it at all. They only lost a bit of their main force~ [RukraM1]
@199  = ~From what you said about their military power, I am sure you are right.~
@200  = ~Don't worry. I won't let my guard down.~
@201  = ~I am still scared. Harmonic Shadow was created by one person, Master. Master is so powerful and that is why he is revered by his cult.~
@202  = ~Master never controlled the cult. The cult moved on its own will, the will of the senior priest Eldifus.~
@203  = ~Master is so powerful that he can take them all in. I have never seen him but I grew up thinking he was god. I cannot even imagine meeting him in person.~
@204  = ~Maybe Master is more like a demigod. I told you god is not omnipotent?~
@205  = ~As you told me, if god gets its power from the people who believe in him, Master could have gotten the power of god from the countless followers.~
@206  = ~You said you are the son of the god of death, but I can't help being worried.~
@207  = ~(She smiles a little at <CHARNAME>, but her smile seems sad.)~
@208  = ~We should not let our guards down, as you said, but....~
@209  = ~I will protect you, even if he is stronger than Irenicus.~
@210  = ~I long for power. If I become invincible, he will be nothing to me.~
@211  = ~He-he, it's too serious. You are a ladies' man, saying things like that without shame!~
@212  = ~Wanting power is good.~
@213  = ~It doesn't even have to be physical power. Even spiritual power helps. Power affords you to look at others' needs and help them.~
@214  = ~But you have to protect yourself. If you are overwhelmed by your power, you lose yourself.~
@215  = ~Right. Those who lose themselves and are controlled by power get swallowed by the power. I won't lose myself.~
@216  = ~You are a really considerate person, <CHARNAME>.~
@217  = ~That's an excuse of those without power, Ruke. Those with real power become the symbol of power.~
@218  = ~Symbol of power? What do you mean?~
@219  = ~That he becomes power itself. Power is the key to eliminate violence and oppression, the invincible spirit. Therefore, unlike the polluted power that is limited by physicality, unadulterated transcendental power does not destroy itself.~
@220  = ~Hmmm are you saying you have that kind of power? That unadulterated power?~
@221  = ~No... no... not really, but I will strive for that kind of power!~
@222  = ~Of course. I have that power.~
@223  = ~That is too vague. Don't trust power too much. There is always something more powerful to defeat you.~
@224  = ~(She looks as if she couldn't believe him.)~
@225  = ~(That's too dangerous, <CHARNAME>. No hero in the world denied his power, but those who trusted power too much always failed.)~
@226  = ~(However her ideas do not reach her beautiful lips.)~
@227  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am worried about something.~ [RukraM3]
@228  = ~What? Is it important?~
@229  = ~Ah, it could be. Umm... about babies.~
@230  = ~Babies? You got a baby?~
@231  = ~Not yet. You and I can, every night... *Umm* Anyway, we can't be responsible for a baby yet.~
@232  = ~We haven't finished Irenicus yet, we are on a journey... so we should not have babies, so...~
@233  = ~I just wonder why you thought about this. I have been using contraceptives to avoid getting pregnant. Do you agree?~
@234  = ~Ummm yes... I.. do... Having a kid can be dangerous.~
@235  = ~Yes, as a matter of fact, I was trying not to get you pregnant.~
@236  = ~Right? That's good then.~
@237  = ~I am curious... What is Yingyang Harmony??~
@238  = ~*Ummm* I am embarrassed to tell you, but Yingyang Harmony is Kara-Tur's magic that stemmed from Taoist sexual practice.~
@239  = ~(She hesitates as if she couldn't say magic out loud.)~
@240  = ~I learned it from Harmonic shadow's library, I wasn't required to.~
@241  = ~Only when I was a young girl... *umm* I was so curious and I had to.~
@242  = ~It was so powerful that I learned it out of curiosity at first, but then later, I was determined to master it.~
@243  = ~Even if I explained the principle, you wouldn't understand, since you don't know the principles of inner chi... I will just tell you the properties.~
@244  = ~It can turn natural energy into your inner chi through Yingyang interaction. It also makes you stronger, thanks to Taegeuk (Grand Ultimate)'s ability to create the world.~
@245  = ~In this process, most of illnesses or injuries can be cured. It also increases our potential power. For people like me, with a lot of inner chi already, it also increases our inner chi even more. Still, my inner chi is under 1000...~
@246  = ~That is awesome! Then superpower intensifies our orgasms?~
@247  = ~What? Do you want ME to tell you that? Idiot! <CHARNAME>!~
@248  = ~(She pinches <CHARNAME>'s lips.)~
@249  = ~Ouch!~
@250  = ~Arrrggghhh! I don't know if I should cry or laugh at this.~
@251  = ~Then, we have agreed not to have kids, right now anyway.~
@252  = ~Something like a vortex dragged me in. This place is crawling with negative evil.~
@253  = ~Why are you looking at me like that, <CHARNAME>? Don't worry. I trust you, wherever we are.~
@254  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>. Don't lose yourself.~
@255  = ~Trust your strength. Don't lose yourself, because of Bhaal's blood.~
@256  = ~*Yawn* <CHARNAME>? What is it? I can sense a strange energy.~ [rukra7]
@257  = ~Wait... Get away from me! I can't control myself! Hurry!~
@258  = ~Run away...! The power of Bhaal...!~
@259  = ~Ruke! Kill me if I turn!~
@260  = ~I can't hear you, <CHARNAME>. Still... I think I understand what's going on.~
@261  = ~What is it? You look ill.~
@262  = ~Just... I got dizzy for a moment.~
@263  = ~That's not it. Honestly... I don't know what's happening to me.~
@264  = ~The nature of Bhaal... It's changing me.~
@265  = ~Really? I was worried. I will help you not to collapse.~
@266  = ~I don't understand what is going on with you... I hope it is nothing.~
@267  = ~Oh, no! I was worried about this! Stay strong and never lose yourself.~
@268  = ~Don't be shaken just because of a dead god.~
@269  = ~All I can give you is useless advice, but remember I am really worried about you.~
@270  = ~Ahhh, what I feared came true.~
@271  = ~Your soul is escaping you and your body is taking charge <CHARNAME>.~
@272  = ~In order to avoid being Bhaal's host, you have to find your soul, quickly.~
@273  = ~Wait! Who are you?~
@274  = ~Didn't I tell you? I am Drizzt, and these are my friends.~
@275  = ~Drizzt? Do you use the Scimitar?~
@276  = ~Hmmm, I've never thought my scimitar is inferior to others. You use dual blades! Is that why?~
@277  = ~I don't think my dual blades are inferior to anyone else's, either. I am getting curious.~
@278  = ~Ha! I have never seen someone as beautiful as you starting a fight with Drizzt. You think you are quite a fighter, despite your beauty?~
@279  = ~An ordinary woman would be naturally attracted to Drizzt, just by hearing about him.~
@280  = ~(Halts.)~
@281  = ~I would love a duel with you, but this is not the time. First, you over there <PRO_RACE>! You need to answer my questions.~
@282  = ~This is not the end, <CHARNAME>. I am not sure what is going on, but there is a strange power...~
@283  = ~You look around Rukrakia and think deeply of the past. As you survived various threats from her cult, you and she fell in love and came to plan your future together. But Irenicus is powerful and you might die or lose her during fighting. You know her loveliness and thinks it is useless to ask, but you still ask her, smiling awkwardly.~
@284  = ~Ruke... I---~ [RukraM1]
@285  = ~<CHARNAME>... don't look at me like that. We don't need to reassure our trust in each other.~
@286  = ~I love you and I trust your power.~
@287  = ~Even if everyone leaves you, I will stand by you. Don't look at me like you are worried about my loyalty.~
@288  = ~Ummm... I thought it was just awkward?~
@289  = ~What! You are still trying to be funny at a moment like this?~
@290  = ~Well, you still have your sense of humour. I need not worry then. Let's go. Let's find Irenicus.~
@291  = ~Rukrakia.... a beautiful but lethal killer in a battle. You joined her journey by saving her from danger. Looking back, you ask her.~ [RukraM1]
@292  = ~Ruke, now it can get really dangerous. You don't have to be part of this fight, if you see no reason to risk your life.~
@293  = ~Ruke, you don't have to insist on accompanying me. This is my fight to regain my soul, not yours.~
@294  = ~Are you ready? This really is going to be the last battle with Irenicus.~
@295  = ~<CHARNAME>... I almost lost myself and you rescued me then.~
@296  = ~Even if this is not my fight, I won't betray my saviour easily.~
@297  = ~I am always ready. Let's hurry, <CHARNAME>. We have to defeat Irenicus and save your soul.~
@298  = ~You are confident, Irenicus. However, it is just arrogance, not competence, because you will let my sword bury your bones.~
@299  = ~Go to hell and stay there forever.~
@300  = ~I am just tired these days, physically and spiritually. My dual blades are not getting better either. It feels like I am facing a huge wall.~ [RukraM3]
@301  = ~If you feel like you are facing a wall, let me help you.~
@302  = ~Wow, your advice. This is exciting?~
@303  = ~Don't expect too much... What I want to tell you is...~
@304  = ~What you want to tell me is?~
@305  = ~A wall is a word people use when they reach their limitation. That means you reached a certain limitation... probably on your use of dual blades. It could mean that your skills will stay at that level forever.~
@306  = ~A wall is an opportunity. That you are staying at your level means that there is no better level from there. Maybe this is a stage of transformation, like from the pupa to a butterfly. And this is the time to start flying.~
@307  = ~What! That is mean! Please tell me you are joking, <CHARNAME>?~
@308  = ~No, I have faced many walls in dire circumstances, and I had to give up every time.~
@309  = ~No, I am finished. A wall is an opportunity. That you are staying at your level means that there is no better level from there. Maybe this is a stage of transformation, like from the pupa to a butterfly. And this is the time to start flying.~
@310  = ~Oh no, <CHARNAME>! That is not helpful advice. That is not like you. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@311  = ~Your advice empowers me, My love. I think what you said is true.~
@312  = ~To be able to fly, I should be lighter, and I should let go of something.~
@313  = ~In Kara-Tur, they say that you have to lose your obsession to be strong in order to be complete. It means, if you have something you want to get, you should lose something else.~
@314  = ~They say gain-lose-exchange. It means what you gain and what you lose is identical. I am sure it is not exactly true.~
@315  = ~What you gain is not exactly the same as what you lose. Anyway, it is true that if you gain something, you will lose something else. The ratio between your gain and loss is a matter of efficiency.~
@316  = ~Boo! Do you understand what she says? Minsc can't! It's giving me a headache. Ouch!~
@317  = ~I have been too obsessed with getting strong. But how can I lose my desire to be strong in order to be strong? Ahh, I don't understand this.~
@318  = ~My love, <CHARNAME>. I have been thinking about what we talked about before, and I think I kind of understand it.~ [RukraM3]
@319  = ~Like burning books to get knowledge, to gain true swordsmanship, I have to break my ideas about my ability. I have to break what I believe to be my ability and gain true skills... so...~
@320  = ~In the end, it means to cut open myself, my desire to be strong. My ego that limits myself. Rip open the pupa and fly.~
@321  = ~Ah, now I think I completely understand it.~
@322  = ~(Her obsidian like eyes shine and you think something has changed.)~
@323  = ~What is going on, Ruk?~
@324  = ~Your eyes flashed light just now. What is going on?~
@325  = ~My love, <CHARNAME>. Thank you. I reached enlightenment.~
@326  = ~Enlightenment? Really!~
@327  = ~Congratulations! I am not sure what is going on, though.~
@328  = ~Why? <CHARNAME>? Is there a problem?~
@329  = ~No, it's nothing. It's really surprising, that's all. What happened?~
@330  = ~You reached enlightenment alone? You will get beyond me one day?~
@331  = ~Oh, what is it, <CHARNAME>? What did I do wrong?~
@332  = ~You don't love me anymore! Oh, your love left me.~
@333  = ~I shouldn't have believed in love...~
@334  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>! Are you being jealous? That's not like you. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@335  = ~(She turns away as if she wanted to hide her tears.)~
@336  = ~My dual blade skills improved! I didn't see any improvement for so long. This is all thanks to you.~
@337  = ~I really should congratulate you! But it's not all thanks to me. You reached enlightenment because you were close to that level. I just gave you a little push.~
@338  = ~That is great. You will be extraordinary in the battle with your dual sword.~
@339  = ~Oh, my modest prince. I am sure now I can help you more.~
@340  = ~Right. I still have a long way to go in my training, but I am sure I can be enough help with my skills now.~
@341  = ~What is Irenicus saying? <CHARNAME>' soul has been fake?~
@342  = ~Anyway, I just need to shut the confident mouth of Irenicus forever? That's easy!~
@343  = ~Right. There is no doubt in the result.~
@344  = ~Irenicus! You will end up lying on this cold ground!~
@345  = ~Stop the bullshit. Come on! Now I can break your idiotic head, you stupid wizard, always on the run.~
@346  = ~You are really kind. Anyone would be mad to be attacked by a stranger out of the blue. You showed me good will.~
@347  = ~I have learned that people should keep their loyalty to their saviours. I am on the run, but I will help you if you promise to protect me from them.~
@348  = ~OK, then let's begin our journey.~
@349  = ~Again, thank you so much. I will try my best not to burden your party.~
@350  = ~(She seemed to be emotionally disturbed. For a moment, <CHARNAME> was tense, thinking she might attack him.)~
@351  = ~(That everlasting short moment passed, she stopped trembling her shoulders, and said, slowly but clearly.)~
@352  = ~Can you keep me safe after that? I've never trusted a promise, but I want to be able to believe your word. Answer me.~
@353  = ~I don't believe you! I'd rather leave. I won't try to fight you since you are my saviour, so don't stop me!~
@354  = ~(She was disturbed by her own emotional weakness, but telling herself that this is for the best, she calmed herself. She wiped the tears with her sleeve and said coldly.)~
@355  = ~ ... OK, Let's go. You will regret it, if you don't keep your word.~
@356  = ~(<CHARNAME> read several emotions in those eyes. The mixed feelings of guilt, despair, and blame seemed to exist there. She started talking, as if she were empty.)~
@357  = ~I remember. Now we should begin our journey.~
@358  = ~I thought about this a lot myself, but can't find answers by myself. If they come, you will be an innocent victim.~
@359  = ~Perhaps I should leave. That is the best act of gratitude to my saviour. I... What should I do? What... would satisfy you?~
@360  = ~It's so nice... to have you with me.~
@361  = ~I thought I might have more time, with my changed name and different appearance. I just didn't think they would find me so soon. I am really sorry.~
@362  = ~I just didn't want to harm the party... Can you understand me?~
@363  = ~Thank you. Maybe I am out of line here, but I think you are really considerate.~
@364  = ~(She was about to finish her talk, and then hesitates, and looks at <CHARNAME>'s eyes. Then she begins again very carefully.)~
@365  = ~And... I want to tell you something. Please listen to me.~
@366  = ~(She doesn't seem offended. Rather relieved, she relaxes her shoulders and answers with a cheerful voice.)~
@367  = ~My name is Rukrakia. I was raised as a priestess at the temple, but I have always dreamt of living with my real name.~
@368  = ~I didn't realize that my dream will come true this way, but I will live as Rukrakia now. That will prove that I am free...~
@369  = ~Oh, OK... Hmmm... yeah, I guess.~
@370  = ~Well, you don't sound too enthusiastic, but... let's go anyway. We should continue our journey.~
@371  = ~Also, this might sound like an excuse, but I wanted to be Rukrakia. Akira is not my real name.~
@372  = ~I got that name while I was raised by the organization. My real name is Rukrakia and I have always dreamt of getting my name back.~
@373  = ~So, I will stay as Rukrakia. Although I didn't expect my dream to come true this way, my name will prove to me that I am free...~
@374  = ~Sure. You are Rukrakia. If I hurt you, please disregard what I said.~
@375  = ~Thank you. I understand you. I won't burden you from now on.~
@376  = ~The sensitivity can reach the level of Shadow Sword through training, like I did. When I feel the other's movement and strike the empty spot, it is always fatal to the other person.~
@377  = ~How can you not know Bhaal? That organization is really isolated from the outside world.~
@378  = ~There are still tens of storm guards, Dark Shadow crusaders, one top priest, tens of priests, and many, many brain-washed shadow members under his control.~
@379  = ~What I am worried about is that they can ambush us any time using this ability.~
@380  = ~You can beat Master. I believe you.~
@381  = ~No. it's different. I know you and you are strong enough. I realized that when you saved me twice.~
@382  = ~Even if Irenicus is a Bhaal's descendant like you, you are strong enough. The future might look pessimistic, but when you actually deal with it, it will be nothing.~
@383  = ~He pretended to be very friendly, but still kept his distance. That felt very awkward, like I am wearing someone else's clothes.~
@384  = ~Then I will have to let her down easy. You are my only love.~
@385  = ~Rukrakia? I have never seen anyone so beautiful as you... You look like you shine through the dark.~
@386  = ~You... I can't believe you grew up in such a scary place. Your face seems so pure.~
@387  = ~Umm, Aerie? I did go through rigorous training and that is true... but after I entered puberty, the training was voluntary, not forced.~
@388  = ~Maybe, though, I guess... that they exempted me from training since they appointed me as the priestess.~
@389  = ~Exempt from training? Then how can you... use your sword like that? When you use your sword, I can't even see the sword!~
@390  = ~*Ha* My naive elf... If others can see the sword, it already fails to be a shadow sword. Besides, you are a wizard, right?~
@391  = ~Anyway, after I was appointed priestess, I studied everything from religious doctrine to physical and spiritual aesthetics, but I never stopped training in mystic arts.~
@392  = ~But your hands are so clean, Rukrakia. It's hard to believe they trained with swords...~
@393  = ~My hands... Ummm, that's a secret. Just think of it as a special beauty treatment, Aerie.~
@394  = ~Th... That is... too bad! You could share beauty secrets...~
@395  = ~I am interested in the beliefs of your old organization, Rukrakia. I serve the Queen of Night and know many gods, but I have never heard of that cult.~
@396  = ~Dark elf, Viconia. I cannot think of the reason why I should satisfy your curiosity, but, OK, I will tell you.~
@397  = ~As the name of the organization, Harmonic Shadow, means, the followers believe in the power of Shadow. Here, the Shadow does not refer to the simple concrete or the whole abstract.~
@398  = ~I am not sure what you mean. What is it if it is not concrete or abstract?~
@399  = ~The shadow signifies the only one. It refers to Master, the revered god in the cult. Beyond being a symbolic existence, he actually has a close relationship to the Shadow.~
@400  = ~That sounds like a knock-off of the powerful Queen of darkness, Shar. Darkness is part of Shar's omnipotent power. I don't want to belittle your Shadow followers, but the range of its power is too limited.~
@401  = ~Well, I can argue with that in many ways, but I don't want to, Viconia. I am not interested in Shar. Let's just continue our journey.~
@402  = ~Hey. I am impressed with your power. You are so beautiful that even Shar could be jealous. When you fight, you remind me of Shar.~
@403  = ~So, what do you want to say, Viconia?~
@404  = ~You are a strong woman, Rukrakia. You don't need to be accompanied by a perverse man.~
@405  = ~If you want, I would like to recruit you as a follower of Shar, but I don't think you will. Here is my advice. Never trust a man.~
@406  = ~You... give me both offence and advice. If you think I look so lame, prove it.~
@407  = ~Not the most pathetic induction such as 'just because other men are like that'. Explain it and prove it using an intelligent method of arriving at truth.~
@408  = ~I don't want to hurt your feelings. I also know that you would not take offence lightly.~
@409  = ~Maybe we should stop this talk.~
@410  = ~Rukrakia. You are very powerful, but I don't think your fight is well balanced.~
@411  = ~*Eh* Jaheira? What does that mean?~
@412  = ~You are an expert in mystic arts and this might not help. But from a balance-oriented point of view, your centre is a little off in the air.~
@413  = ~It could help your reflex, but is bad for the ultimate balance, since you lose complete control of your body.~
@414  = ~Hmmm, maybe that is right. So you are saying I should lower the centre of my weight, right?~
@415  = ~Right. For all living creatures, the ground is very important. If you lower the centre of gravity, you do not lose balance, and make it safe.~
@416  = ~Thank you for your advice, Jaheira. I will try to lower the centre of gravity and improve my reflex.~
@417  = ~Anomen, I don't want to offend you, but I don't understand people like you, trying to be just. How can you live like that?~
@418  = ~*Hmm* Lady Rukrakia, I don't understand you either. Everyone has good will.~
@419  = ~We only awakened the good will. I am sure you have desire for goodness deep in your heart.~
@420  = ~Um, sure, Anomen, maybe it is so. However, I cannot fight for justice all the time.~
@421  = ~Well, Even knights of justice like us cannot act just all the time. We only try, but we also confess our sins and pray for forgiveness to purify our sins because they destroy us.~
@422  = ~Right, but I think we differ in how just we try to be. Do we have different perspectives?~
@423  = ~Oh, I do not want to continue our conversation. I am not naive enough to believe everyone is good. I just want to punish evil in the name of justice.~
@424  = ~Miss Rukrakia, whenever I see you, I feel your swordsmanship is too brutal.~
@425  = ~Sir Keldorn? My swordsmanship is too brutal?~
@426  = ~Yes, it might have the same result of killing someone, and this can be an excuse, but I think we should treat our enemy with respect.~
@427  = ~However, your blade only focuses on killing your enemy, very cruel, oblivious to where it strikes and where it cuts, ruthless.~
@428  = ~*Hmm* I have never thought of this. I only concentrated on finding the fastest and most effective way of killing my enemy.~
@429  = ~I am sure I never had any respect for my enemy, but why do I need any respect for my enemy?~
@430  = ~You are not a knight, so I don't need to force this on you. I am only concerned that your soul is not influenced by cruelty.~
@431  = ~I hope so. I am not in a position to overlook evil.~
@432  = ~Lady Rukrakia? Whenever I see you, I am reminded of my childhood friend Jeff.~
@433  = ~Jeff? Who is she?~
@434  = ~Not she, lady, he. Jeff always liked to make fun of others.~
@435  = ~So he used to cover his face with rags and socks and scare off passing dragons, roaming around my great grandfather's turnip field.~
@436  = ~The problem was that my grandmother had bad strabismus and could only see her own nose. He stole my grandmother's prism lensed glasses my great grandfather made especially for her.~
@437  = ~I saw a halfling in pain, with flaming socks and rags and the prism lenses on his head, burning through the turnip field. I reported this to my great grandfather right away.~
@438  = ~He was my friend, but he did not know that the glasses did not work, and that was his ultimate mistake. He was sleeping in the turnip field and burned his head because of the glasses. Luckily, he managed to keep his sight.~
@439  = ~How do I remind you of him? How are we similar?~
@440  = ~Well, I am curious about that, too.~
@441  = ~Rukrakia, although I am a dwarf, I am not repelled by you. I usually hate creatures with long arms and no hair.~
@442  = ~I have nothing to say to you, Korgan.~
@443  = ~Huh, whatever! I just feel some dwarf energy around you. Maybe something you ate as a child?~
@444  = ~...~
@445  = ~Damn, I will be watching you.~
@446  = ~Hah! I can't take this anymore. I am not going to stand here and take your insult!~
@447  = ~Well, I don't understand why you want to pick fights with me, but bring it on!~
@448  = ~I tried to keep peace! All my old adventures ended in blood! I don't think this will be an exception!~
@449  = ~I am sure I tried harder not to cause trouble with you!~
@450  = ~Let's see how well you fight!~
@451  = ~Minsc? What kind of person was your witch?~
@452  = ~Dynaheir? She was my witch. I lost her during Dajemma, a test to prove my manhood....~
@453  = ~She was such a wise witch, even Boo recognized it, but I failed to protect her.~
@454  = ~Well, Minsc, sometimes things are unavoidable and we cannot do anything about them. Don't blame yourself too much.~
@455  = ~Minsc does not blame himself... it's just that Boo is sad. I didn't get to finish Dajemma and won't be respected in Rashemen.~
@456  = ~I don't regret it, though. I have good friends and I am in the process of becoming an invincible warrior. Right Boo?~
@457  = ~Minsc, how old is Boo?~
@458  = ~Uh, well? Minsc never thought about Boo's age! Now that you mention it, Boo seemed a bit weak lately!~
@459  = ~I heard hamsters do not live as long... maybe you should take a better care of Boo, Minsc.~
@460  = ~Oh, ri, right! It's been a long time since I got Boo! Maybe you are right! What should I do? Tell me Boo!~
@461  = ~Boo! Are you OK? Right? You don't move much these days! Are you sick? Tell me, Boo!~
@462  = ~Ah, I didn't know you will take this so seriously. I am sorry, Minsc.~
@463  = ~No, that is not true. Minsc is going to take better care of Boo! I will buy some fruit seeds!~
@464  = ~Nalia, you are an amazing woman.~
@465  = ~What do you mean, Rukrakia?~
@466  = ~It's just... I am amazed that someone could have such conviction... and be brave enough to abandon the privileges as an aristocrat.~
@467  = ~I have never thought I was out of ordinary... This is right. Those aristocrats with endless desires are wrong.~
@468  = ~Right, but not many people follow their ideas. That is what I mean.~
@469  = ~Um, thank you? I guess? Rukrakia, it is not difficult for you either, to follow your heart.~
@470  = ~(Oh, Thay is losing face as a wizard.) Oh, excuse me, Lady Rukrakia, are you aware that you have a flaw?~
@471  = ~A flaw? Tell me Edwin.~
@472  = ~(Damn. This might piss her off.) Lady Rukrakia, you ran out on your world to pursue freedom. Do you think you are free?~
@473  = ~What do you mean? I think I ... umm...~
@474  = ~(That is what I thought.) Well, this clever wizard does not believe so... (Yes, that is right!)~
@475  = ~You did not know the meaning of freedom when you ran away to be free. I am sure. You are still not quite free.~
@476  = ~(She really looks confused.) The degrees of freedom belong to the environment. Not just the degrees. Anyway, you only grew up in one society.~
@477  = ~I think you were absolutely influenced by your society. The sense of freedom in your mind is shaped by the society.~
@478  = ~It is even more so because you were supposed to be a saint. So, when we start on the premise that humans are mortal and it is impossible to be absolutely free from restraints...~
@479  = ~Oh, I get it, Edwin. You want to say that my idea of freedom is restrained and it is impossible to be free from it, my old society is better than here?~
@480  = ~(Why would she cut me off? What an ape!) Hmm, yes. Besides, even apart from the principle, even in a general sense, you are limited in your freedom because <CHARNAME>, the leader here, saved you?~
@481  = ~Hmm, certainly, well maybe you are right... But...~
@482  = ~Right. Really my search for freedom might be just an excuse. I did not run away with a great aim for freedom.~
@483  = ~(And I am not mentioning this to increase your animosity against me, you scary bitch) Oh, alright. So?~
@484  = ~But, why are we so poor? There is no money for seeds! Oh, no! Argggh!~
@485  = ~I... I just wanted to avoid pain. To run away from conflicts... Just... just for me.~
@486  = ~(Hmm, it is surprising this scary woman seems vulnerable.)~
@487  = ~Well, we are the most important things to ourselves. Anywhere, any time. *Hum* Let's stop being pedantic.~
@488  = ~Do you have a kind heart that sees the beauty of nature, Rukrakia?~
@489  = ~Um, Cernd? Well, I think... I am quite ordinary. What is beautiful looks beautiful, ugly looks ugly...~
@490  = ~Certainly. People have a sense of beauty, but nature lacks that sense of beauty.~
@491  = ~Are you talking about essence of nature?~
@492  = ~It is a part, rather than essence. A property. It is slave to nature, if it resembles nature... no it was always nature. It becomes nature when it returns to nature.~
@493  = ~That's far-fetched... If it is nature no matter what, it needs to just continue living, right?~
@494  = ~It is so, but oh, Rukrakia. I need to keep the natural balance since I am a slave to nature.~
@495  = ~Nature has no sense of beauty. It is just what it is. We return to the state by accepting nature, seeing, smelling, touching nature.~
@496  = ~Nature is even more beautiful, because there is no sense of beauty.~
@497  = ~*Ho-hum* That sounds very lyrical...~
@498  = ~You... Oh, my inferior imagination fails me, right! My beautiful Black Hawk!~
@499  = ~Eeckk? Black Hawk? A black hawk? I do like to wear black... anyway, what do you want to say, Haer'Dalis?~
@500  = ~A beautiful creature like you needs no reason, my Black Hawk.~
@501  = ~*Tsk tsk* Your flattery will get you nowhere, playboy? Don't look at me with the same eyes that admired passing woman number 1, 2, 3.~
@502  = ~Aw, your claws are too long and sharp to be my Black Hawk!~
@503  = ~But I only appreciated their looks. It doesn't mean anything.~
@504  = ~This is, just, oh, I am entranced by your black feathers. Don't get me wrong, Black Hawk.~
@505  = ~Rukrakia, your bracelet. Do you use it during battle?~
@506  = ~Yes, Valygar. It is a trigger that opens Dimension Door.~
@507  = ~The civilization in this world is so dependent on magic. It might be better to be free of magic. Not just you, but for everyone...~
@508  = ~Why do you feel that way? Magic comes from desire, but desire makes it possible for humans to exist. If we oppress desire, it will escape the control in any way possible. That might be even more dangerous.~
@509  = ~Well, magic is a very dangerous realm. I don't believe magic can be controlled by human laws. Remember magic has evil as its premise.~
@510  = ~Um, I think there exist ambiguous fields. There are things that don't fit binary or trichotomy classification. Magic can change depending on the users' intentions.~
@511  = ~What do you mean? I didn't get it.~
@512  = ~Simply put, we cannot judge magic to be good or bad.~
@513  = ~Even if we try to say this is right and the others are wrong, there exists a crack that falls between the two values, or outside of the two values... anyway, the crack is an open, broken, space.~
@514  = ~Of course this differs depending on the degrees, but magic is just a tool and subject to fulfil human desire and can be controlled by the user.~
@515  = ~I think it is very different from drugs or gambling, at least. Don't you think?~
@516  = ~Hmm, it is hard to understand you, but quite impressive. I should think about this further.~
@517  = ~You dwell in confusion. Rukrakia, a quiet desperation.~
@518  = ~Mazzy, I... am not sure what you mean. I dwell in confusion?~
@519  = ~I am a halfling, but I think humans have goodness at heart, everyone. We just have to wait for it to come out.~
@520  = ~In that sense, you have goodness in your heart, but it is surrounded by darkness. It looks quiet and stable, but underneath the surface, it is very different.~
@521  = ~May be so... Mazzy, but doesn't everyone with a heart face confusion?~
@522  = ~Of course, our heart is like water, a disturbance causes many water rings...~
@523  = ~But in your case, a disturbance might cause storms, typhoons, earthquakes, and tsunami.~
