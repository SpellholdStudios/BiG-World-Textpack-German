@0    = ~Don't you need me anymore?~
@1    = ~Oh, shit. This is my fault. Please come back to my party.~
@2    = ~Yeah, I think it is better if we go our separate ways.~
@3    = ~Yes... I should repay you for saving my life...~
@4    = ~(She sighs and nods.) I will be leaving now.~
@5   = ~I knew you would come and save me, <CHARNAME>.~
@6   = ~What happened? Ruke? What is going on here?~
@7   = ~Right, <CHARNAME>. Milte and I are sisters. I am older and Milte is...~
@8   = ~Oh, you saved me again! I knew I could trust you!~ [RukraM2]
@9   = ~Right. I had a sister when I lived in Calimshan, and now we are reunited.~
@10  = ~*Haha* She has her own mind, doesn't she? Even when I was living in Calimshan, she acted like she was my older sister.~
@11  = ~She was so smart even then, and now she is all grown up and a great wizard. Oh, I am so proud.~
@12  = ~Also... I am really moved. I almost had tears in my eyes when I saw you coming to save me...~
@13  = ~Now I... can trust you. I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@14  = ~I love you too, Ruke.~
@15  = ~Well, wait, Ruke. I like you as a friend, but just as a friend. Nothing more!~
@16  = ~I just came to rescue you as a member of the party, nothing more.~
@17  = ~Uncle Gerhadt once told me. Love needs turnips. Long time ago, when uncle Gerhadt met his first love, Rosé, he had his own turnip farm. He was in love with Rosé, and she loved turnip pies.~
@18  = ~Then, one day, a Cambion from an Outer Plane bought uncle Gerhadt's turnip farm. Therefore, Rosé had no more turnip pies to eat. Uncle Gerhadt tried to buy back the turnip farm from the Cambion, but he would not sell it. Rosé left my uncle and he started his turnip farm again, and cried over his lost opportunity. That was really sad.~
@19  = ~Umm... Yes, it is sad. Jan.~
@20  = ~Really... Do you love me, too?~
@21  = ~Of course. How can I not love a lady this beautiful!~
@22  = ~He he! Thank you, my love. Now you should do your work. You should continue the journey. It was delayed because of me...~
@23  = ~Oh, no...! I thought you love me as well...!~
@24  = ~Was it my delusion? Was it really?~
@25  = ~I am sorry. I want you as one of the party members.~
@26  = ~... Yes, go, my love. Even if you don't love me, I don't deny my feelings for you. I am sure, one day, these feelings will disappear, too.~
@27  = ~Oh! Milte is dead! She was trying to save me, and then she... *Waaaa*~
@28  = ~Who is Milte? Do you know her?~
@29  = ~She is my sister! She is my only sister who lived in Calimshan with me.~
@30  = ~We got separated when I was captured by Harmonic Shadow, but she came to rescue me, because I was in danger. Finally I got to see her again...~
@31  = ~But now she is dead. Oh that poor thing... *Sniff*~
@32  = ~Calm down, Ruke. I am really sorry for your loss, and I am sure she was happy to have saved you, even in death.~
@33  = ~Do you really think so? *Sniff*~
@34  = ~Of course. Now just calm down. (He gives her a hug.)~
@35  = ~I am sure. We have to keep ahead, leaving the dead behind.~
@36  = ~*Sniff* Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Now I have only you to comfort me when things get difficult.~
@37  = ~I don't want to lose my loved ones anymore. I... I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@38  = ~Yes, It's sad... but we should keep going and look at the future, not the past. But...~
@39  = ~... No. Let's go, <CHARNAME>. I am leaving my heart here.~
@40  = ~You... You are not abandoning me here? Right?~
@41  = ~I was really scared, <CHARNAME>! Don't joke about those things.~
@42  = ~Oh, you are not joking! I thought you loved me...~
@43  = ~I won't regret what happened... It's just... No, I am leaving. *Sniff* I am leaving...~
@44   = ~Good day, everyone.~
@45   = ~Hey, darling. Don't look so surprised.~
@46   = ~What, what are you? What happened?~
@47   = ~You... you kidnapped her, now?~
@48   = ~I can't believe you are pulling this stunt. Return her to me if you don't want to die.~
@49   = ~What is what? What darling is thinking is right.~ 
@50   = ~I am just employed by Harmonic Shadow. This is not personal. No hard feelings, OK? I regret meeting you like this, because I have been paying attention to your work.~
@51   = ~What darling suspected is right.~
@52   = ~Whoa, Whoa... Don't look at me like that.~
@53   = ~Me too, I regret meeting you like this.~
@54   = ~Harmonic Shadow... It's really driving me mad.~
@55   = ~I will kill you and get her back. Wait a little here. You will meet death.~
@56   = ~Well, darling. Are you serious? Darling is so hot and makes my heart skip a beat.~
@57   = ~Don't go crazy here, darling. I have something to give to you.~
@58   = ~Well, I can't play around anymore. Darling, do you know this? If you kill me, you can't find her.~
@59   = ~I told you Harmonic Shadow hired me, right? They told me to give this to you.~
@60   = ~What is it?~
@61   = ~It is an invitation. Important thing is, it was my job to give this to you, and now my job is done.~
@62   = ~Well, I am sure I will run into you again. Goodbye then, darling!~
@63   = ~Darling, don't you see me? Anyway, I can't believe you really came here. Brave, or idiotic?~
@64   = ~You looked so miserable, so I made sure she was safe.~
@65   = ~Anyway, I want to say that her mind, not her body, is in trouble.~
@66   = ~Her mind? What did you do to her mind?~
@67   = ~In order to kill you, darling. She disclosed too much information about Harmonic Shadow to you, and now they can't let her live.~
@68   = ~Therefore, this is a trap. Oh, sweet, miserable darling.~
@69   = ~Well, yes. I hear you, Master Amildar.~
@70   = ~It's nothing, darling. Let's just say that I played a little trick.~
@71   = ~Hmm, don't get mad, Mr. Adel. My assignment was just kidnapping Akira and giving you the invitation. Everything else was my own creative work.~
@72   = ~So, you never suspected that I was left there after the work?~
@73   = ~*Hem* Pretending to be fragile, you have changed, sis.~
@74   = ~Sis? Then you are Rukrakia's sister?~
@75   = ~Don't look so surprised, darling. Anyway, I was a little surprised when you came all the way to rescue her. Really, a child of Bhaal is something.~
@76   = ~Anyway, have an emotional reunion. I have saved my sister and destroyed some Harmonic Shadow idiots, so I should get going.~
@77   = ~You are not a paid assassin?~
@78   = ~You think I would do something that low? *Hmm* My darling is really ruining the moment in the end.~
@79   = ~Well, then keep the spirit and always take good care of my sister. Also...~
@80   = ~That was quite moving. Now I am leaving, darling. Hope to see you again!~
@81   = ~Good day, <CHARNAME>. I wasn't sure whether or not you will show up, but you showed up. I want to pay respect to your stupidity.~
@82   = ~Shut up. Where is she?~
@83   = ~Is she safe?~
@84   = ~I can explain that, <CHARNAME>.~
@85   = ~We are only interested in her Pure Negative Essence within her virgin body, and have nothing to do with her intelligence.~
@86   = ~However, do you know why we waited for you here without returning to our temple?~
@87   = ~Why was that?~
@88   = ~Stop interrupting, Milte. Remember you are only a hired assassin working for us.~
@89   = ~To see you are being so witty, I guess you have something up your sleeves. I don't know what it is, but you'd better be careful. Otherwise, you will end up with a knife deep in your throat. Better watch your step, Milte.~
@90   = ~Anyway, I will have to show the power of Controlling Ego Tablet. Keep your expectations high, <CHARNAME>.~
@91   = ~Now, kill him, Holy Lady!~
@92   = ~Playing tricks? This is all your doing, Milte!~
@93   = ~You dare kill priest Amildar and disrupt a big Harmonic Shadow function!~
@94   = ~I shouldn't have trusted you. Thanks to your personal interference, you will lay your bones here.~
@95   = ~Wait, what is going on? Milte, are you helping us?~
@96   = ~Everyone, shut up! I have no time for your little bickering. In the glory of Harmonic shadow.~
@97   = ~We will kill you all.~
@98   = ~Now, we should stop. We should just do what we are supposed to do as colleagues.~
@99   = ~I can't say I love you when I don't. To me, you are just one of the party members.~
@100  = ~We don't know that. We just have to look to the future, and what's ahead of us.~
@101  = ~I am not sure, really. However, it is obvious truth that she wanted your happiness. Therefore, you should not be sad.~
@102  = ~Of course, if darling didn't come, she would have lost her essence to that Master. The effect of essence drinking decreases greatly if the essence comes from a non-virgin, so I am sure Harmonic Shadow wouldn't have done anything to her body, even without my interference.~
@103  = ~I suppressed her mind, using Harmonic shadow's Controlling Ego Tablet. We are sacrificing the holy lady to Master.~
@104  = ~You suppressed her mind? That is despicable! I will kill you!~
@105  = ~Damaging her mind, you are despicable!~
@106  = ~I heard you are a hired assassin, do you belong anywhere?~
@107  = ~I am not interested in being a hired killer. Many places want my ability and skills.~
@108  = ~So, Ruke and Milte know each other? Is that why Milte betrayed them?~
@109  = ~Thank you, my love... Now you should do your work. We should continue our journey that was delayed because of me.~
@110  = ~~
