@0    = ~It's them! They are here!! Oh, that man is...!~
@1    = ~I am sorry. I was just trying to hide from their eyes.~
@2    = ~Oh, the situation is getting worse. I would have never guessed Sezar would bring storm guards with him!~
@3    = ~I am never going back, Sezar! You haven't forgotten why I left the church? Don't you know I know? I would have died even if I stayed in the church!~
@4    = ~You saved me! Oh... to kill Sezar...~
@5    = ~This was no problem. Keeping you safe will be easier than I expected.~
@6    = ~I thought I was dead! Phew... (She sighs thinking about her future)~
@7    = ~This was a joke. I am sure I can protect you with no problem, he he.~
@8    = ~Today could have been my last. Oh no... (She is sad)~
@9    = ~(She brightens) Wow! I am so happy! That you are so strong and that you are protecting me!~
@10   = ~But you shouldn't be so full of yourself. I don't want to see you fall.~
@11   = ~Sorry. You have saved me twice. All I can say is thank you. Thank you.~
@12   = ~To think that you are the warrior to kill Sezar... It makes me trust you more? (She blushes)~
@13   = ~Hohum! Hmm... Thank you for your kindness.~
@14   = ~Yes. Thank you anyway. I trust that you will help me in the future, too.~
@15   = ~You tried to abandon me! You are like a chameleon, changing sides whenever it is dangerous!~
@16   = ~Whoa Whoa, calm down. I just.... umm... (He stops realizing he has nothing to say)~
@17   = ~I protected you, anyway? No matter how it was done...~
@18   = ~I am sorry. I was just scared. I didn't mean it!~
@19   = ~Save your breath! I don't trust you. I am leaving.~
@20   = ~Right.~
@21   = ~But if Sezar hadn't intended to attack you, it would have been different. Stop your lame excuses.~
@22   = ~I don't trust you. I am leaving.~
@23   = ~Yes, you are a coward. And a traitor. I won't forget.~
@24   = ~Yes, how are you, Saint Akira.~
@25   = ~Akira? What do you mean? Miss Ruke, did you give me a fake name?~
@26   = ~That was useless. You'd better not think about leaving the church. You are mistaken if you think you could trust that idiot next to you. As long as my storm guards are here with me, Sezar!~
@27   = ~Holy lady! Give yourself up now. Don't you know your actions are against God's will, no matter how holy you are?~ 
@28   = ~You stupid person! Don't you know that it is more glorious to come back to God than to die in a deserted place like this! How can you not see the difference!~
@29   = ~Stop! I am not going to be in the middle of this. Just take her.~
@30   = ~Anyone trying to take her will die. Come if you don't fear death!~
@31   = ~Storm guards. Kill everything!~
@32   = ~You stupid child. Those with our secrets will only end up dead...~
@33   = ~(She blushes when she sees <CHARNAME>. Then she smiles shyly)~
@34   = ~(She says nothing, just taking in how <CHARNAME> looks at her. <CHARNAME> does not read anything in her dark eyes. She welcomes him as if nothing happened)~
@35   = ~Welcome. We will continue with our journey.~
@36   = ~Umm... Do you have something to say to me, <CHARNAME>?~ [rukra26]
@37   = ~Please do not use Dimension Door during the battle.~
@38   = ~OK.~ [rukra32]
@39   = ~Please use Dimension Door during the battle.~
@40   = ~Please do not attack recklessly during the battle.~
@41   = ~Please attack as you will during the battle.~
@42   = ~(She stares at him without saying anything)~
@43   = ~What is it? We should continue our journey.~
@44   = ~(She blushes and looks away from <CHARNAME>)~
@45   = ~Why, why? You want to kiss me!~
@46   = ~(He hugs her from behind)~
@47   = ~(She whispers without refusing <CHARNAME>)~
@48   = ~Hmm... we should just get a room.~
@49   = ~Should we... now?~
@50   = ~(She blushes, but replies with a smile, playfully)~
@51   = ~(She gets startled and blushes)~
@52   = ~Eww! This is a dungeon. We can't, no matter how much we want to.~
@53   = ~Hehe. You are crazy about me, <CHARNAME>. You will never be able to leave me now.~
@54   = ~I was getting restless. This is excellent. Shut up and bring it on.~
@55   = ~As a servant to god, I can't tolerate a cult like you! You, slaves of evil!~
@56   = ~Stupid cleric! Don't you know that your God lived in darkness! Shadow is the ancient God!~
@57   = ~(Huh! The apes are playing well together I can't get out of this boring play)~
@58   = ~Oh, no...! You are most beautiful, more than any other woman in the world. Meeting you like this is the biggest challenge for me, Salvanas.~
@59   = ~You are Salvanas? What challenge? What are you talking about?~
@60   = ~Oh, my angel. I am Salvanas, a lone wolf roaming around  Faerun for beautiful ladies like you.~
@61   = ~My burning love has covered Faerun in flames, lighting all the ladies hot desires.~
@62   = ~But now you are here, with your beauty that will put all the others to shame. I can see that my soul will belong to you, my beautiful master. Ah, heavy, heavy burden!~
@63   = ~But my angel, do not worry. I will bear this heavy burden and run to you always!~
@64   = ~Eww! Don't come near me! I will strike you if you come any nearer!~
@65   = ~(Rukrakia moves like lightning and blocks his advance with Hupjeonggum (Soul absorbing sword)~
@66   = ~Oh! My angel, beautiful as a rose! You have a sharp thorn. But thorns can't separate you and me.~
@67   = ~Nothing will stop true love! (Salvanas recklessly runs towards Rukrakia)~
@68   = ~Aw! B... Blood!~
@69   = ~So... sorry! I was too startled... and I hurt you...~
@70   = ~First aid! We need first aid for bleeding! I hear the captain calling for me! Yes! I am coming, captain, coming!~
@71   = ~Well, Adalon? Your wings are beautiful, all glittering in silver.... Can I touch them?~
@72   = ~Female human child. You also look quite beautiful to me, but.... hummm.... I can not abandon my racial pride just to satisfy your curiosity.~
@73   = ~Eh... it's not allowed. Well, I would be angry, too, if someone thinks I am beautiful and wants to touch me.~
@74   = ~You learn fast, although... this is a bit different.~
@75   = ~Your arrogance will bring about your fall, Black Lizard.~
@76   = ~Shut up, you arrogant female! An intruder who bothers a dragon will have a taste of death.~
@77   = ~Huh! You are only a fat lizard who cannot fly. Are you curious about hell?~
@78   = ~I will show you soon. Then, you will know.~
@79   = ~This is unexpected, right? That man, Jierdan Firkragg, I sensed a powerful fiery energy from him.~
@80   = ~I don't want to hazard a hasty guess, but I smell conspiracy. Anyone who does not identify himself clearly has a reason to do so.~
@81   = ~Hmmm... you are really.... a proper dragon. You deserve the name, in many ways.~
@82   = ~Hmm, lady. I have lived a long life, but I have never seen a human as beautiful as you. Very interesting.~
@83   = ~Ha, His eyes are good, huh? <CHARNAME>?~
@84   = ~Hahaha, it is impressive that you can be so relaxed in front of Jierdan Firkragg, brave human.~
@85   = ~A vampire and a wizard... I understand, now, <CHARNAME>. I am sure it's Bodhi and Irenicus.~
@86   = ~I can't believe they reached out to the Underdark. What a busy life.~
@87   = ~Huh... <CHARNAME>. Life with you is an interesting adventure.~
@88   = ~Stupid ogre, but I guess, this is a place where stupid ones survive.~
@89   = ~But we are different. You can use Dimension Door to find a way out.~
@90   = ~It's up to you. I can use Dimension Door, but you cannot...~
@91   = ~Wow! Baldur's Gate? You told me about the place, right?~
@92   = ~It will be interesting to fight this orc, the one you beat?~
@93   = ~Hehe! Is this your lover? <CHARNAME>?~
@94   = ~Boo says he doesn't like you. Boo! Pull out that nose hair, now!~
@95   = ~Oh! *Blush* You recognize me well! Your eyes, intelligence, and judgment seem normal here.~
@96   = ~Stop messing with me, female human! I still have to talk to <CHARNAME>.~
@97   = ~I guess you know each other? Hmmm, I don't know why, but that orc seems to be full of grudge.~
@98   = ~I can't forgive the trashy mind flayers.~
@99   = ~They remind me of my past, to oppress someone and make them obey.~
@100  = ~Besides they think these life and death battles are a play. They make me so mad.~
@101  = ~If their existence is only about this play-off conquer and oppression, I really want to get rid of them from this world.~
@102  = ~Drows just say what they want to say and then disappear. I hate them...~
@103  = ~If it hadn't been for your work, I wouldn't have left this sadistic pervert alone.~
@104  = ~If we pour these tadpoles into a clean aquarium, the fish stink from Kuo-Toa will be better.~
@105  = ~Bodhi, are you threatening us?~
@106  = ~Hmmm, who are... you? We have no information about you.~
@107  = ~My name is Rukrakia. I have no grudge against you, but I think I will have no problems creating one.~
@108  = ~Are you provoking me? According to my vampire senses, Miss Rukrakia, you are not an easy foe.~
@109  = ~That doesn't matter. We haven't lost to chuck yet, and we are here to cooperate.~
@110  = ~I want to avoid threats, just for that bold girl, but well, I am not going to take back what I said... follow me, <CHARNAME>.~
@111  = ~I am not against your decision, <CHARNAME>. But I don't like that vampire, looking like a black spider.~
@112  = ~Huh! I learned assassination skills for Murder Sword, too, but I can't overlook a vampire putting down a true rogue. Next time I see you, your head will be separated from your body.~
@113  = ~Wow, foul mouth. You can see that I am a vampire. We don't have information about you. Who are you?~
@114  = ~Well? I don't have to give you my name, especially to a vampire I will end up killing later?~
@115  = ~Hmm, you seem quite strong, but I will see if your prophecy comes true. Anyhow, <CHARNAME>?~
@116  = ~The vampire seems to be tripping us, hmmm, anyway, let's see.~
@117  = ~Even for you, I don't like humans being sacrificed to vampires. I am sure there is a way to solve this problem without killing them.~
@118  = ~I don't feel sorry for the dirty harlot, but I feel weird thinking that the people there will be destroyed by vampires.~
@119  = ~This dirty deal is coming to an end. But I think I will fight that vampire one day.~
@120  = ~I knew I will fight that secretive vampire one day. I just didn't like him the first moment I saw him!~
@121  = ~Miss Rukrakia, we did a little research on the organization you used to belong to.~
@122  = ~It operates in the dark underground. It is a powerful organization.~
@123  = ~That organization had no reason to interrupt our work, but you are a little different. Are you a traitor?~
@124  = ~Huh! Why is that so important? Don't even think about getting information from me. You want information, go out in the daylight and collect it.~
@125  = ~I can't communicate with you. Ummm.... anyway, <CHARNAME>...~
@126  = ~Huh! For a guy who has to run away every time, you sure talk a lot. Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@127  = ~Well, you do not disappoint, Bodhi. Bring it on if you want to.~
@128  = ~Is your life a game? A game addict with lots of bluff.~
@129  = ~You bother me every time, Rukrakia. Don't worry. You are also a kill in this game.~
@130  = ~I can see that you are ready to run away, again, lowly vampire.~
@131  = ~Huh! The way you are getting mad, I am sure I can put you down this time.~
@132  = ~Hmm, Irenicus is strong, but I don't think he is stronger than the master of Harmonic Shadow.~
@133  = ~Well, anyway, we only have the final attack left. <CHARNAME>? Don't get hurt??????~
@134  = ~Oh, it is sad. That cursed vampire is playing dirty.~
@135  = ~This is a trap. That weird faced wizard set us up.~
@136  = ~Hmm, your company? You are bold, talking about my face... Anyway...~
@137  = ~Oh, this is not good. To lose your soul to that weird looking wizard.~
@138  = ~I am getting so mad at Irenicus, that he would set us up with a trap, not a battle. Now he is discussing our lives.~
@139  = ~Hmm, only the ones with a lot of preparation win the battle, bold woman.~
@140  = ~You just weren't prepared enough.~
@141  = ~Huh! You arrogant wizard. You weren't prepared enough for this kind of attack.~
@142  = ~A blow on an unguarded spot would always be fatal. Same to you.~
@143  = ~Just as Bodhi said. Rukrakia, I don't like you. Your threatening disposition, hazardous bluffing, there is nothing inoffensive about you.~
@144  = ~And <CHARNAME>? I heard something interesting from Bodhi.~
@145  = ~Wow! Do you know this arrogant, crude idiot, <CHARNAME>?~
@146  = ~Ha! To insult me, Xzar! I should have kept Montaron with his scary face all the time!~
@147  = ~Who insulted who first? I do not condone anyone who is rude to my saviour!~
@148  = ~I have no time for a woman like you! I hate talking to idiots.~
@149  = ~You'd better take that back? If you don't want to die!~
@150  = ~How do you take it back from garbage? I don't have time for this. Get away!~
@151  = ~You are ready to die?~
@152  = ~Eh! <CHARNAME>? Didn't we come here to save Imoen?~
@153  = ~Was chasing Irenicus more important than saving her?~
@154  = ~Well, I would not oppose you in your decision, but I think you should be more considerate.~
@155  = ~Hello, Imoen. I am Rukrakia.~
@156  = ~Oh, hello, Rukrakia. I am Imoen.~
@157  = ~I have heard about you from <CHARNAME>. I hope you are not too sad about being child of Bhaal...~
@158  = ~Even if you have to face some danger, I am sure you will survive it.~
@159  = ~How? How can I survive this crazy fate. <CHARNAME> and I...~
@160  = ~Well, I am not an optimist, but I am sure there are ways. Even very narrow ones.~
@161  = ~No one wants to be in danger, but everyone has to face danger for sure, and they don't always have fatal consequences.~
@162  = ~I am sure it is painful, but what goes down will come up again, and after the harshness, there will be reward. That's what I believe.~
@163  = ~Wow! Now we are taking the ship to Spellhold, finally. In fact, this is my first time on a boat, hehe.~
@164  = ~In a word, Saemon, you are notorious in this area, too.~
@165  = ~Hehe! That pretty girl is right, <CHARNAME>.~
@166  = ~Hehe! If you want crazy, there is a good one in my party.~
@167  = ~Huh? Why are they looking at me? Boo! Do you know?~
@168  = ~Well, this is enough. Great party members, <CHARNAME>.~
@169  = ~Now, we just have to find a way to Spellhold. Let's go, <CHARNAME>.~
@170  = ~If that notorious pirate shows perfect loyalty, that would be weird, too.~
@171  = ~That insincere smirk makes me sick. Yuck! Next time I see him, I will surely bury him underground.~
@172  = ~It will help us well to make use of them.~
@173  = ~Boo, we should not trust the pirate. I am sure he has something to gain by helping us.~
@174  = ~Hmm, that is up to you, however you want to interpret it...~
@175  = ~A help from a pirate... This is a scary help. Huh! Maybe he feels he is in danger and wants to hide behind us.~
@176  = ~Stronger than God, God is immortal at least. I don't know what that weird wizard is hiding.~
@177  = ~A pirate has no concept of loyalty, so what else can we expect other than saving his life?~
@178  = ~It's nice to see you, too. I missed you as much as your nasty talk.~
@179  = ~I can't believe we have to steal to get a boat.~
@180  = ~I guess a horn is good for the pirate king in return for his evil acts. If someone has to pay him reward.~
@181  = ~A weak one has to be conspicuous. A cunning pirate...~
@182  = ~Hello Ellesime. Sorry to interrupt. I heard you share the legendary beauty of elves. It's an honour to meet you.~
@183  = ~Well, but the legendary beauty is... umm... Hmmm, I can only say ummm...~
@184  = ~If you are talking about me, I have to comment on this, no matter how much hurry I am in. You are rude.~
@185  = ~Inner beauty is better than outer beauty and your rudeness tells me that your interior is not that beautiful.~
@186  = ~Inner beauty? I heard from Irenicus that you betrayed him. You are the one to talk about inner beauty?~
@187  = ~Don't be hasty in judging others if you don't know the whole story. We had our differences.~
@188  = ~Oh, I don't know why I have to waste my time bickering with you. I need to talk to <CHARNAME>.~
@189  = ~Did I tell you that Joneleth has let loose parasites to the Tree of Life?~
@190  = ~Oh, don't worry too much.~
@191  = ~Miss Rukrakia, I would like to, too... but just give me some time.~
@192  = ~I hope this works out without too many problems. If lady Maria and Sir Keldorn break up, this would also affect their children..~
@193  = ~Huh, you behave as you look, crude and violent, dwarf.~
@194  = ~He! Du, pretty lady there! You talk like a sailor. You behave differently from your looks.~
@195  = ~However, if you are not the leader of the party, you should not get involved.~
@196  = ~Dwarf! I have been watching you. I think you should shut your mouth.~
@197  = ~Huh! What? I will cut your pubic hair with my axe until you come.~
@198  = ~Bring it on. Your beard will be chopped off at my sword, first!~
@199  = ~I will show you how worthless you are, dwarf!~
@200  = ~Cursed, do trolls have that kind of power?~
@201  = ~I think she is under some kind of power, ummm, I am not sure, <CHARNAME>.~
@202  = ~We have to punish him for wanting to kill us at first sight.~
@203  = ~<CHARNAME>... Maybe you can take that, but I can't.~
@204  = ~Attack. What makes you think you can take up space here with that kind of power? Are you paying rent here??~
@205  = ~Mazzy, we can take care of a violent dragon.~
@206  = ~Is it just me, <CHARNAME>?~
@207  = ~Hmm, beautiful human female! You seem very confident?~
@208  = ~Well, maybe it is better because we can kill the evil dragon, if you are as competent as you are confident.~
@209  = ~Anyway, what is important is...~
@210  = ~We can finally kill that arrogant wizard. It really took all my patience to put up with him.~
@211  = ~Boo and Minsc seem really happy, although I don't care about fame.~
@212  = ~Huh, I feel that I learned something important.~
@213  = ~I do want to help out people in trouble sometimes, but I don't understand people like you with so much good will.~
@214  = ~Nalia, that was great. You are so different from me. You are so passionate, like a volunteer worker.~
@215  = ~Hum, I think taking care of a troll would be a light warm up...~
@216  = ~Since there are a lot, maybe it would be a bit hard on my shoulders.~
@217  = ~Huh, it doesn't look too good for the keep.~
@218  = ~An empty looking keep... I wonder what the servants did and why their lives are threatened.~
@219  = ~Of course, in this dog-eat-dog world, there is no sin...~
@220  = ~Watch your mouth. You call your helper rude, old lady?~
@221  = ~I can't stand arrogant aristocrats.~
@222  = ~Um...mmm! Old lady... I have my reasons. You should think before you talk.~
@223  = ~Oh, I hate that Mazzy. What makes her so arrogant?~
@224  = ~Oh, you know this insolent Mazzy, <CHARNAME>?~
@225  = ~No matter what, I will stop talking. It's your business.~
@226  = ~*Sigh* Are you saying we have to be in the same party as Mazzy, the snake?~
@227  = ~Ha! (Dirty ape!) What about me? I am superior even among Thay wizards. I am different from other worthless wizards.~
@228  = ~*Sigh* Really how can he do that to his lover, at least one-time lover.~
@229  = ~I don't know if he ever loved her.~
@230  = ~ha! That slave trader loved me? Never! (Cough)...~
@231  = ~Oh no, calm down. Jaheira. It was out of my place. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@232  = ~Anyway, we should find a way to break Baron Ployer's curse.~
@233  = ~I wouldn't get involved in your decision, but this is wrong.~
@234  = ~We need to focus more on each member, to strengthen the bond between members.~
@235  = ~It breaks my heart to abandon a member just because he is in trouble...~
@236  = ~Huh! You think you can represent nature?~
@237  = ~Who decides what is enemy of nature? Nature? Or you? Obviously you think you are so high and mighty?~
@238  = ~You are just a tyrant, exploiting nature just because it does not complain. Shadow Druid.~
@239  = ~Your nature that you so wanted to protect, it is dying along with other animals that lost intelligence because of you.~
@240  = ~The food chain is broken, balance has been ruined, and nature is howling. Don't your rotten ears convey the pain?~
@241  = ~You have no right to judge, woman. You are not Druid and you don't even know Druid. You should be quiet.~
@242  = ~I think it was right that the leadership changed, Cernd. I can't overlook people who destroy nature. I didn't learn my skills for nothing.~
@243  = ~I don't know who this Druid is at the top level. I really want to see his insolent face.~
@244  = ~Contrary to your fragile beauty, you have such a strong will, woman.~
@245  = ~The one who believes himself to be Druid must know the duty and behaviour of Druid and follow them.~
@246  = ~Wow! Are we going to be on the same team? I am so glad, Cernd. I am Rukrakia...~
@247  = ~Pleasure is all mine, Rukrakia. You seem to understand nature very well.~
@248  = ~Since I am a woman, I understand women. A woman ages right away when she is not loved by someone. The attention is crucial.~
@249  = ~From a girl to a woman, a woman to a middle-aged woman, a middle-aged woman to an old lady... like that. She becomes cold without passion, and turns tawdry.~
@250  = ~But, I want to wait for my lover, and cherish the love for ever... If I really love the person.~
@251  = ~well, <CHARNAME>? If you are curious, you can go upstairs. I can hear people talking upstairs.~
@252  = ~Whoa! There is drama everywhere. That's another drama here, although the setting is too mundane...~
@253  = ~*Sigh* There are too many crazy people in this world. Maybe because it is so hard to make a living nowadays.~
@254  = ~I never liked you from the beginning. Attack.~
@255  = ~Damn vampire! Are you ready to run away? Now get away.~
@256  = ~I would love to shut your mouth, too, Rukrakia. We will meet again soon.~
@257  = ~How could anyone be so perfectly insane? I am sure there is a reason.~
@258  = ~Please rest in peace, and forget about this pain...~
@259  = ~Phew, finally we can cut the fins off this stupid, rude Black dragon.~
@260  = ~Wow! Edwin! That is so great! Now, you are a big sister?~
@261  = ~(Huh, What is going on?) Who, who is a big sister? I am Edwin!~
@262  = ~I don't know what kind of power nether scroll has, but I am very excited that your power will increase a lot.~
@263  = ~(Ha, you have been so cheeky with me, but now you will have to kiss my mighty power!)~
@264  = ~Now Edwina disappeared. Oh, it is sad.~
@265  = ~Nether scroll? Is this a treasure hunt? Of course, <CHARNAME> has the final word on this.~
@266  = ~Huh, he is in charge here, huh? Like a director in a mental hospital.~
@267  = ~Oh, that is how a life disappears, leaving a trace behind.~
@268  = ~It was good that we didn't kill for no reason. You did something good, <CHARNAME>.~
@269  = ~This is a trap, <CHARNAME>. This is not human smell. This... is like... the one who we ran into before...~
@270  = ~Huh! Ambush my ass. I will stay alert, and you should just fight, Werewolf!~
@271  = ~We are trying to have a conversation with a crazy person with no reason. A typical religious fanatic.~
@272  = ~This frail fanatic lost his mind. After all, he had no logical mind to begin with.~
@273  = ~There is omnipotence, but not in your power, idiot!~
@274  = ~I smell conspiracy. This is very fishy.~
@275  = ~I smell conspiracy. I hope that Garren can help us solve this problem.~
@276  = ~I am sure this is that Jierdan Firkragg's doing. I think this is not going to be simple and easy.~
@277  = ~Just attack before I mash up your mouth, and stop with the babble.~
@278  = ~Sure. We will just wait and see. Just how worthless your skills are.~
@279  = ~You will see. Just be prepared to die.~
@280  = ~You are still talking, idiot! You are playing king among the worthless trash.~
@281  = ~Huh, you surely can talk. I can see you are an experienced actor. I am sure you got a lot of women that way, right, <CHARNAME>?~
@282  = ~This is... some mind control. I think the wizard, Mekrath, did it. I should go and see his face.~
@283  = ~Right, Mr. Hendak. If we keep working with faith, we will be able to make a safe place.~
@284  = ~I have seen enough injustice, oppressing people with force and imprisoning them.~
@285  = ~I will destroy all the evil in this place, if what you said is true.~
@286  = ~Sewer... well, it smells horrible, but we can't help it, if we want to see those bastards.~
@287  = ~Huh! You are not going to inns to see cowmen? Hohum. I hope it is not true.~
@288  = ~See what? I don't want to look at your disgusting face?~
@289  = ~Bring it on! I would love to see how you reigned over the slaves!~
@290  = ~You, who are you to interrupt me?! Hendak, did you employ this bitch?~
@291  = ~Huh! You dared reign over slaves with your puny power.~
@292  = ~Is this our first quest? Stealing a gold god statue from the Temple of Lathander? Humm.~
@293  = ~Anyway, it is so difficult to find a decent person among these thieves. Including that bandit, Mae'Var.~
@294  = ~Stealing the amulet from the Temple of Talos, that's our first quest?~
@295  = ~Finally, we can bury this bandit. Oh, it's been so hard to put up with him...~
@296  = ~*Sigh* Holy slaves... men, women, whoever has less power gets exploited. It is everyone for himself.~
@297  = ~No one listens to the powerless, except for good people like <CHARNAME>.~
@298  = ~This guy, Chremy... I am sure he has a lowly life. This is just depressing.~
@299  = ~There is no excuse for stealing, but I feel like we should at least listen to this kid.~
@300  = ~It is a pity... he is so young...~
@301  = ~Therefore... You are sentenced to death, Galvena.~
@302  = ~Who is it! Huh... did I hear it wrong?~
@303  = ~No need to wonder, idiot. Your guild has been ruined, your guards have disappeared, and you don't have those slaves to order around any more.~
@304  = ~You, you! How did you get in here?~
@305  = ~Is that important now? Just give me Claire, the one you were torturing, old lady.~
@306  = ~Wrong person! No way, I could see that right away.~
@307  = ~Ha! Galvena is caught red-handed. Let's fight, Galvena's dog!~
@308  = ~Ha! You are fooling around with another man, behind your husband's back.~
@309  = ~An assassin without heart! You really like to watch those scarecrows play!~
@310  = ~Shall we see how well your scarecrows fight!~
@311  = ~Ha, they want to get evidence using us. How easy and convenient.~
@312  = ~I don't know who Mae'Var is, but I don't expect much from him. His servant...~
@313  = ~I have never felt so free, being ordered by a thief. Now we can go kill that dirty bandit?~
@314  = ~(Huh, a powerful nickname for a puny thief... Is the world of thieves really so weak?)~
@315  = ~(I have improved so much just using their beginners assassin skills... This is disappointing)~
@316  = ~Are we playing a riddle? Hmmm, this is difficult. A bridge that ends in death must be life. For a mortal.~
@317  = ~A journey might be an awkward expression for this, but if they go together, it must be time. What passes time is future, and if it leaves you behind, it is past.~
@318  = ~The present involves many different choices, crossing one bridge out of many in order to reach the future. Therefore, it is always unstable. And ends in many different places.~
@319  = ~Ha! The mission is cleared! I am very smart, aren't I, <CHARNAME>?~
@320  = ~I don't understand the question. I don't get it.~
@321  = ~We are talking to the director of a mental hospital, remember, <CHARNAME>. They use questions like these to check the patient's mental status.~
@322  = ~Don't worry about logic and just say whatever that is sensitive and pleasing to the ear.~
@323  = ~Don't worry about logic and just say whatever that is long-sighted and progressive.~
@324  = ~This petulant hospital director wants to see your good will. Your answer should be enough.~
@325  = ~He keeps giving you psychoanalytic questionnaire for mental patients. This is bleak, so just say something sympathetic. I am sure if you say anything aggressive, he will give you a horrible diagnosis.~
@326  = ~Now a riddle? This is vague, but if there are many different views on it according to people's perspectives, what the rich need, and what the poor have in abundance, that must be nothing.~
@327  = ~However, what controls the problem is always a generalization representing the majority.~
@328  = ~I think this is personification of objects, oh, I am not sure. Is this about the permanence of river and properties of nature?~
@329  = ~This is easy! Fear weakens people in the worst case, but without fear, people would lack the ability to avoid danger.~
@330  = ~What makes people to sweat, even in the cold, what accompanies the weak, what the brave lack, what divides the weak and the brave, it is fear.~
@331  = ~What reminisces the lost, what smiles at joy, what cries at sadness, it is memory.~
@332  = ~What brightens your life and what you lose when you die. Well, that depends.~
@333  = ~Ice is lighter than water, what shows above water in an iceberg is nothing compared to what is hidden underneath the water, it also breaks ships occasionally.~
@334  = ~Burning fire resembles a dancing soul. With fire gone, night becomes darker, but when we feed it fire revives and it dies with water.~
@335  = ~The answer is a coffin. Isn't it too predictable? Those who want to die are exceptions, so not included in this general theory.~
@336  = ~A candle burns itself, and burns out in an hour. A thin candle will melt away faster, and a thick one will take longer time. A wind blows them.~
@337  = ~The more we have it, the less we can see. I think it is darkness, but to wish upon it? Ha, this is ridiculous?~
@338  = ~Evidence of night must be the moon or stars, and sailors navigate their way using stars, so it is solved.~
@339  = ~What follows you, black, runs away from the light, but disappears when there is no light, that is a shadow! Ha!~
@340  = ~Phylum Porifera and porous, don't you see? What can hold a lot of water must be sponge.~
@341  = ~What frees us from life, we only get once when we first draw breath, and weighs when we need it, that sounds like when we are about to die.~
@342  = ~The questions are written in the figurative language and only hint at things. They are not very articulate. Huh!~
@343  = ~What always drink water and wear scales, must be fish. However, fish can breathe, and be warm and cold, since they are cold-blooded animals. The makers of these questions are prejudiced.~
@344  = ~Maybe the premise is that there is no secret in the world, I don't know what to say. I can say though, that it is not good to have biased ideas.~
@345  = ~What holds darkness, is weightless, and does not own anything... I think it is air or a hole.~
@346  = ~Air is a necessary prerequisite for darkness, and it makes it lighter in a box, so it must be a hole. But isn't it a very special case with a box?~
@347  = ~Stop bluffing, you big headed skeleton! Ha! The only thing you have is a hard head, without a brain!~
@348  = ~Fight, skeleton!~
@349  = ~Don't you know you are making a scene with your one-man show? Are you calling for your comrades because you see you are going to be crushed?~
@350  = ~Your crude talk is killing me, woman. Shut up and just watch.~
@351  = ~Huh! If you think we know too much, you can always disappear!~
@352  = ~Slaves? You are very pleased with yourself, casting this arcane barrier that doesn't even look like a barrier, idiot wizard!~
@353  = ~An honest merchant who sells high quality illegal flasher? I think it is a bit oxymoron... Don't you think?~
@354  = ~Umm, <CHARNAME>? What are you going to do? It wouldn't hurt to have a joker like Jan Jensen in the party.~
@355  = ~Stone Golem... his sword skills are crude.~
@356  = ~To end like this... this is like a soap drama.~
@357  = ~I have no right to say anything, but I am a woman. May I offer my opinion, Colette?~
@358  = ~Huh? Yes, of course... I can't make up my mind anyway.~
@359  = ~Actually I don't remember my parents that well, so I don't understand why you are so obsessed with your father.~
@360  = ~If you really love Daar, no, if you love him enough to go against your father's will, then you should choose him.~
@361  = ~But if you want to respect your father's wishes, you should give him up.~
@362  = ~This is not that easy to decide. Either choice will bring about a tragic result.~
@363  = ~When you are at a crossroad, there are two things you can do.~
@364  = ~One is to choose, the other is delay. It depends on the situation which is better, but at least, you should choose one of them.~
@365  = ~What I would like to recommend is to choose, but maybe delay might suit you better. You are tender-hearted.~
@366  = ~Don't be dragged around by the situation and delay. Just choose delay. As long as you are aware that you are delaying your decision, you can humbly accept the result of the delay.~
@367  = ~Thank you for your advice. I guess I need some time to think about this.~
@368  = ~Are we arresting a fallen paladin? That sounds like a glorious achievement.~
@369  = ~It is a dead... god. The essence has disappeared and only the remains are left... It reminds me of Bhaal.~
@370  = ~It shows a god's destiny... surviving if only there is a worshipper, even one worshipper. Is this tragic?~
@371  = ~This... is something very holy. Huh, something this holy does not suit me.~
@372  = ~Erosion of eternity has ended... It's not sad, but still I want to cry...~
@373  = ~I think there is a story here. He just starts babbling strange stories. Maybe he is heading north.~
@374  = ~She sacrificed herself to avenge her friend. She just trusted us, blindly. She would have been so resentful... What a pity...~
@375  = ~Ho! The three scoundrels are here! You know this is not a place for your trashy talk?~
@376  = ~Be ready to rot in hell forever, lowly hooligans!~
@377  = ~Huh! Where do you think you are going! Idiots!~
@378  = ~You are leaving us after all your spotty talk?~
@379  = ~Did you have problems with our talk, beautiful? Don't hang out with that geek. I will give you one gold, how about it?~
@380  = ~Ha! Ha! That's a good idea, one gold for three!~
@381  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I just can't take their insult... *Sigh* I just can't.~
@382  = ~I might interrupt your work, but I can't take this humiliation. I can't sleep at night after this kind of insult.~
@383  = ~To this disposable carcass...! I am reaching the end of my patience.~
@384  = ~I am going to kill all the idiots that strut and be rude around me.~
@385  = ~Huh! What is it? An earthly creature is insulting the divine Baron Thelokassyil?~
@386  = ~(He! He!) My food is talking. I can't let something like this alive, just to believe King Ixilthetocal's prophecy.~
@387  = ~(Her panting calms down and only her sharp killer's instinct remains)~
@388  = ~<CHARNAME>... I am sorry. I will kill them all, even if you don't help me.~
@389  = ~Next time... I will try to control myself, no matter how bad the insult is. But right now...~
@390  = ~(You can sense that her eyes are full of killing aura)~
@391  = ~Did the imps like the game? I was a bit under the weather, but a game might excite me.~
@392  = ~There are booby traps all around us, so we should take care of them first.~
@393  = ~This is not a difficult game... We will try again, <CHARNAME>. There might be a lot of treasure, who knows?~
@394  = ~It is so cute that these tiny winged creatures are protecting us? He he!~
@395  = ~But, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't open it, does it, Spectre?~
@396  = ~Ha! It was just a conspiracy to include us in the plan, or to just kill us.~
@397  = ~Such an idiot, just like a moth flying into the fire, not knowing it is death!~
@398  = ~Oh, the selfishness of humans! It creates these idiots!~
@399  = ~The weak die and the strong survive. Since that was your life, you have no regrets, right? Even if you died!~
@400  = ~I have bad feelings about this, <CHARNAME>. That Samia, with her innocent smile, is very fishy. We should be careful..~
@401  = ~How come my feelings about the idiots are always right? I think I will be biased against bounty hunters...~
@402  = ~I think I will be prejudiced after all these disappointing losers.~
@403  = ~Fight, loser 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6!~
@404  = ~I didn't expect him to be in such a crummy place, what a hermit. I thought a hermit would stay in a place with great scenery.~
@405  = ~Hmm, maybe I am getting dry, but this has no sentimental impact. I understand art, but I don't appreciate it.~
@406  = ~Shut up before I cut off all your beard, Dwarf. I don't know how you survived with that trash mouth of yours.~
@407  = ~Be ready to die!~
@408  = ~Be quiet before I cut off all your beard, Dwarf! Be prepared to die!~
@409  = ~I don't know how long you stood here, but you got cursed by someone else's trick.~
@410  = ~He looks even dirtier than the previous dragon. Where does that arrogance come from? Huh, this is a mystery.~
@411  = ~A shrine showing animosity towards the living, what is this? This is not rage of nature? Huh!~
@412  = ~(You could have gotten your beloved Joneleth, but you couldn't. That's because your love was not strong enough.)~
@413  = ~(I am not sure if my love is the right way for me, but I don't want to end up like you. I am going to try, at least.)~
@414  = ~Irenicus is dead? Is this over, now? *Phew*~
@415  = ~A power struggle among the aristocrats is common. I see that two common aristocrats have been to visit us.~
@416  = ~I can't believe that they suddenly became interested in us, just because we became famous. Us, the *common people* they usually look down on.~
@417  = ~Hmm! An athletic competition. Then you will die playing sports, Genie!~
@418  = ~Rakshasa... I don't know what it looks like, but I would like to see it. Isn't it a monster in Kara-Tur? Khan Zahraa.~
@419  = ~We found that vicious and sly human here. I can't believe that he made it this far.~
@420  = ~He is in such a rush. I am sure he has an important reason.~
@421  = ~Huh! He denied his charges, and then runs away when he can't back up his innocence. We have to follow him, <CHARNAME>.~
@422  = ~Huh! I really want to clean up this base of the monstrous creatures.~
@423  = ~A proposal, <CHARNAME>. We'd better think about this carefully before we make any decisions. I think this can be a breakthrough for us.~
@424  = ~Of course, there was an ulterior motive. They didn't attack our ship for nothing.~
@425  = ~Huh! Being an explorer is not the best job in the world. They are cute. I wonder if <CHARNAME> was also so innocent?~
@426  = ~Hmmm, we should first meet the ogre. That would be the fastest way to get closer to truth.~
@427  = ~Oh this is getting more complicated? I don't think this would have a simple ending.~
@428  = ~We have to find a clue... There might be a hint.~
@429  = ~Anyway, it is time to act, <CHARNAME>. I feel like we stepped into the thick of the adventure.~
@430  = ~Something is wrong here, <CHARNAME>. This is not right and I feel sick.~
@431  = ~This is no different from villains actions, this is inexcusable.~
@432  = ~This really does not look like Madulf's work. We should find another clue.~
@433  = ~People are scared of ogres, but even ogres know who helps them and try to repay the debt. There are so many humans who are less than ogres.~
@434  = ~Still, Merella's hut is the only place for clues. We will have to check it out there...~
@435  = ~Oh! Wait, Who is that beautiful woman next to you?~
@436  = ~Eh? Me? (Oh no! I acknowledged that I am the beautiful woman?)~
@437  = ~Your beauty draws out admiration from us, dryads. It is a pity you are mortal.~
@438  = ~To help the beautiful lady, I will give you another piece of information, <CHARNAME>. A dragon lives in that northern dungeon.~
@439  = ~A red dragon. Be careful, if you want to keep the beauty in her for a long time.~
@440  = ~I didn't know there exists such a curious hemisphere. I would love to explore it.~
@441  = ~I am sure there is a better way. At least it won't be late to listen to Valygar' story and then decide.~
@442  = ~This is disheartening. We would be no different from villains.~
@443  = ~Huh, have you seen her before, <CHARNAME>? Her life depended on Shar and then on you.~
@444  = ~A curious vampire. He reeks of blood. He doesn't feel right.~
@445  = ~Hehe! (Why is he so funny? He says all kinds of silly things. So cute.)~
@446  = ~It's a kind of riddle. There are stone statues around a box, and we have to arrange things as is written on the statues.~
@447  = ~Something that appears silently at night, and sets during day. Then we can put star medallion, meaning stars.~
@448  = ~Hehe, should I keep helping you, <CHARNAME>? If you are not sure, don't be shy and ask.~
@449  = ~Yes, help me with the Golden circle.~
@450  = ~Yes, help me with Worn out boots.~
@451  = ~Yes, help me with the Jar of water.~
@452  = ~Yes, help me with the Sundial.~
@453  = ~Yes, help me with the Sun medallion.~
@454  = ~Yes, help me with Sword medallion.~
@455  = ~Yes, help me with the Statue of gagged head.~
@456  = ~Yes, help me with the Mirror.~
@457  = ~Yes, help me with the Hourglass.~
@458  = ~Yes, help me with the Grinning skull.~
@459  = ~Should I keep helping you?~
@460  = ~Yes, continue helping me.~
@461  = ~No, it is enough now.~
@462  = ~If you don't know, or can't remember, you should talk to me.~
@463  = ~Remember a golden circle is a round circle. A circle is endless and it symbolizes the seasons in the world.~
@464  = ~Worn out boots. Boots come in pairs, and they support our weight. We work in worn out boots and take them off when we rest. That is enough, right?~
@465  = ~A water jug is easy when you think about water. Little water in a jug can help you by quenching our thirst, but we can drown in a lot of water like lake and sea.~
@466  = ~We have to remember two things about a sundial, the sun and the clock. The sun symbolizes eternity, and eternity makes many things possible, like making flat land into a mountain, or destroying ancient Netheril. Without endless time close to eternity, these things wouldn't happen.~
@467  = ~We should think about the sun with the sun medallion. To a man wandering in a dungeon, the sun is a sign of a way out and therefore, hope. The stare of the sun would easily be the glaring sun in the deadly desert.~
@468  = ~The sword medallion is easy, right? A sword is a symbol of violence, and although it save someone's life sometimes, other times it could kill you. A debateless argument, I think.~
@469  = ~A gagged head? That, I don't know either. I am sorry.~
@470  = ~Except that, I can help you with everything else. There is only one left. Say my name and you can destroy me.~
@471  = ~Mirrors are easy, too. Symbolically, mirrors always show us the reflections of ourselves, as we are. This is connected to truth. Of course, mirrors do not talk.~
@472  = ~An hourglass makes sense when we think about the shape of it. It has one body, but two heads. It is not true that sands move faster as time goes by, but it just feels that way.~
@473  = ~A skull reminds us of death. Mortals want to defeat death, but the moment they defeat death, they are no longer mortal. A smiling skeleton laughs at the mortals' desire. And when death wins, all the pain disappears.~
@474  = ~Please wait just in case. If I have a question, I will ask you.~
@475  = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>.~
@476  = ~Why are you staring at me? Are you hungry?~
@477  = ~(She widens her eyes, as if it were strange?)~
@478  = ~Did I do something wrong? Please say so if I did.~
@479  = ~*Hum* Why are you looking at me like that?~
@480  = ~Oh, it is hot. I am going to walk ahead.~
@481  = ~(She touches her hair and pretends not to notice <GABBER>'s stare)~
@482  = ~Hehe! Am I too beautiful to look at? Should I strike a pose?~
@483  = ~Stop staring at me like that. I am getting shy. Hehe, those sly eyes...~
@484  = ~Stop looking at me like that. You might wear my beauty huh. Try to keep moderation.~
@485  = ~(She holds <GABBER>'s hands and says)~
@486  = ~Oh no. Stop it. Don't you see others can see us?~
@487  = ~(She allows <GABBER> to touch her and then stops him in a hurry)~
@488  = ~Your hands are moving upwards. Not out here.~
@489  = ~(She is alarmed and turns around)~
@490  = ~Not in a place like this. If you want me, tell me when we are in bed.~
@491  = ~We will see.~
@492  = ~Storm guard. It is time for slaughter!~
@493  = ~Now it will get easier to get rid of you.~
@494  = ~What the hell is this?~
@495  = ~You are struggling in vain!~
@496  = ~Die, you!~
@497  = ~If the holy lady dies, you die, too. That is the best curse for people connected to each other.~
@498  = ~You'd better protect the holy lady, if you want to live.~
@499  = ~I want to talk to you about something else.~
@500  = ~Whore... To think a person can possess another person... It is definitely wrong when we try to respect others' free will.~
@501  = ~We all want to protect ourselves, but to protect others who can't protect themselves... This is a way to protect all of us, we are all special to someone.~
@502  = ~Everyone cannot be me, but I can be a part of 'we'. This is an issue beyond contractual conditions. Galvena might think we are all objects without our own will...~
@503  = ~Anyway, we lost our middle man and we have to find someone to replace him.~
@504  = ~This is going to be difficult.~
@505  = ~Yes, tell me about Star Medallion.~
@506  = ~~
@507  = ~~
@508  = ~~
@509  = ~~
