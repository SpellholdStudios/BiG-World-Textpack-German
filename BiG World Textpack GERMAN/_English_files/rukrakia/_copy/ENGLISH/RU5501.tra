@0    = ~Raigen's Tomb?

I met a guy called Jenkins in Saradush. He asked me to kill a guy named Elber somewhere in Amkethran. Jenkins was killed soon after by an assassin who followed him, The assassin warned me to look away, but the choice was always mine.~

Elber was by Amkethran Inn. Whether or not I asked him questions, he just looked reluctant. He had the map to Raigen's tomb and I had to take a choice.~
