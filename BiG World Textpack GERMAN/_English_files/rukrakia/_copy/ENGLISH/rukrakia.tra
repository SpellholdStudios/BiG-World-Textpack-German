@3    = ~Trashy bitch!~
@4    = ~(No response.)~
@5    = ~Every... one.... run... away....!!! Kawkkkk!~
@6    = ~You.... me......~
@7    = ~Die, bitch!~
@8    = ~What happened?~
@9    = ~(They look at each other in silence.)~
@10   = ~I am sorry. I didn't mean to... I was under attack. Would you like some help?~
@11   = ~(The blood flows dark and she vomits blood clots.) Retch!~
@12   = ~*Phew* ...you saved me from falling under black spell. Thank you.~ [RukraM1]
@13   = ~Failing under a spell? What do you mean?~
@14   = ~Black spell... (In deep thought.)~
@15   = ~Are you sure you are OK? You vomited blood...~
@16   = ~It is a long story. I was raised by a cult and the cult put me under a spell to keep me from running away or betraying them. I didn't know that when I was young...~
@17   = ~I wanted to be free. I didn't want to be raised for a purpose and be abandoned when they were done with me. I stole their Hupjeonggum (Soul stealing sword) and ran away... and...~
@18   = ~(She smiles at him.) That you are worried about me. You are a nice person. I am OK now.~
@19   = ~Ummm.... so.... you ran away... and was under a spell?~
@20   = ~(He nods.) ...Why did you run away?~
@21   = ~Oh, OK. That is an interesting story.~
@22   = ~They might come anytime... *Sniff *  save me... Please... I am begging you.~
@23   = ~Thank you.... with all my heart.... really... thank you.~
@24   = ~Well, that can be a bit difficult. You might want to go back there.~
@25   = ~Sure. Of course. We welcome you to our party. We will protect you...~
@26   = ~I understand... and... thank you...~
@27   = ~I was possessed by evil force and could not escape it, but thanks to you, I could calm it down. I am really sorry and grateful. I... *Sniff*~
@28   = ~Aaaarrrrrrgggggggg!!!!!~
@29   = ~(She does not respond to <CHARNAME>, but she seems to have regained consciousness and starts speaking a bit.)~
@30   = ~(After the blood clots, she looks pale, but otherwise seems fine. She seems to recover right away.)~
@31   = ~That is good that you are OK, but what happened? What is going on?~
@32   = ~(Right then, her eyes tremble in fear. She begins quietly as if she were scared of something.)~
@33   = ~I found out about the spell today, when I ran away from the cult. When they realized I ran away, they activated the spell, and then I lost my mind. That is why I tried to harm you.~
@34   = ~But why did you want to betray your cult. They raised and protected you, right?~
@35   = ~I... had a severe training since I was young. I only learned later that the training was to learn mystic arts from Kara-Tur. The training was so brutal that I almost lost all my human qualities, but with pain, I completed most of the secret skills.~
@36   = ~But then I found out that I would become a scapegoat for the cult. I was supposed to sacrifice myself so that Master of the cult could drain and take my life. Oh, I was so scared and sad when I learned it!~
@37   = ~(She got upset and her dark eyes become wet and then tears.)~
@38   = ~yes, right, although running away from home is not exactly correct...~
@39   = ~But you forgot to tell me one thing. Why did you run away from home?~
@40   = ~Boo is angry! That they tried to keep this beautiful woman as prisoner!~
@41   = ~I hope you take a wise decision, <CHARNAME>. Harpers do not abandon those who ask for help.~
@42   = ~(It is already almost uncontrollable, and they want a new ape in the party? No!)~
@43   = ~It is saintly to help someone in trouble, <CHARNAME>. It is doubly so when it comes to such a beautiful lady as this.~
@44   = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>! I am for helping this lady. She is just too beautiful to leave in the wood. Ho hum...~
@45   = ~Ugh! How did you? Oh... <GABBER>?~ [RukraM1]
@46   = ~Hello, Ruke, I called for you again.~
@47   = ~(She throws herself to <GABBER> with tears in her eyes.)~
@48   = ~Wwwaaaaa! You came back to me, <GABBER>!~
@49   = ~*Sniff* I was alone... *Sniff* And it was so lonely...~
@50   = ~Calm down, Ruke.~
@51   = ~*Sniff* Now you won't leave me alone, right?~
@52   = ~Of course. Let's forget about the past and begin again.~
@53   = ~I was waiting... for you to say that.~
@54   = ~I will never disappoint you again.~
@55   = ~No, not yet.~
@56   = ~I, I... what am I supposed to do...? You called for me... I...~
@57   = ~Calm down, Ruke. This is my Pocket Plane, and it is safe here. Wait for me here. I will come for you.~
@58   = ~Oh, OK, <GABBER>... I...~
@59   = ~I will wait here... for you...~
@60   = ~Did you come for me, <GABBER>? Are we leaving now?~
@61   = ~Of course. Let's go.~
@62   = ~No, I just stopped by. Sorry, just wait a bit longer.~
@63   = ~Oh, OK... I will wait.~
@64   = ~(Dark blood flows from her pale lips. She seems to be in a lot of pain.)~
@65   = ~You can blame me that I am selfish to want to save myself... All these people I killed... innocent people... and their bodies rotting around me... and yet I want to survive this...~
@66   = ~So, you were the monster in this forest.~
@67   = ~I do not believe people like you. You just want to save yourself.~
@68   = ~I... couldn't stop. I knew I was killing people, but I couldn't stop...~
@69   = ~Forgiveness... I know it is impossible... all the people are already dead and they cannot forgive me...~
@70   = ~But I can't just sit here and wait for death... *Sniff* the cult I ran away from might come... to kill me. Help me. Please...~
@71   = ~(She turns away and walks away from the party, covering her shaking shoulders.)~
@72   = ~Monster in Black Forest?

Now we know about the monster in Black Forest. The monster that slaughtered the woodcutters was a young woman, and she asked me for help, but I did not want to help the woman who still wanted to live after what she did to others.~
@73   = ~Monster in Black Forest?

Now we know about the monster in Black Forest. The monster that slaughtered the woodcutters was a young woman, and she asked me for help. She committed a bloody crime, but she was an honest person without guile, and I wanted to help her since she was in danger because of what someone else wanted.~

I had a conversation with a half-crazed woodcutter. I guess he lost his mind from shock after losing his friends to the monster in Black Forest. He told me where Black Forest is, but I think this will be pretty difficult to find.~
