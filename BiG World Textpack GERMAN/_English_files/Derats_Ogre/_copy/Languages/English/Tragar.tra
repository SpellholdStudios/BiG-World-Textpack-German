The return to the clan will be lively, that's for sure. Thank you again, my friends. Maybe we'll meet again one of these days.~ // FIN S_JOURNAL 407

@303 = ~Hmm.... it's surprising that you'd take it like that after you have spent so much time helping me. But I understand. Maybe it was too long. It's your decision to make; I thank you for what you have already done for me, and I will solve this new problem by myself. Thank you again, my friends. Farewell.~ // FIN S_JOURNAL 407

@304 = ~If possible, yes, and I thank you. But this time I will not let you go alone. I may be blue, but I'm again a dwarf. So I can walk around the town without too much trouble (except for the strange looks and the mocking laughter, of course).~

I came to Athkatla to complete a special commission, and I intent to fulfill it if there is still time. Thank you for what you have done for me, and about the rest... Well, I'll manage. Thank you again.~ // FIN S_ JOURNAL 405

I'll finish what I have to do even if I'm blue, and I will solve the case of my color when I return to the clan. The clan will welcome me with a smile, that's for sure.~ //QUIT S_JOURNAL 408
