@0    = ~Greetings my friend, I hope you are well. I am sorry you cannot buy anything here, if that is what you came for. I think Master Lian will tell you the same. I have received orders from him to stop.~
@1    = ~Are you sure you cannot sell me anything?~
@2    = ~Very well, see you later.~
@3    = ~Greetings! You can speak to Master Lian if you need anything.~
@4    = ~I think I will.~
@5    = ~Good. We are not merchants and we are not proud to work as such... especially now when we have enough gold to go home.~
@6    = ~Very well, maybe I will speak to Master Lian.~
@7    = ~See you later.~
