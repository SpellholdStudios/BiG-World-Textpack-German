-  After Saemon Havarian had finished his incantations you stood for a few minutes in expectation. The ship, ready to sail was still in Athkatla’s docks... You were about to sigh and pronounce your thanks that at least it was not frog-turning, and request refund from the sly sailor. Suddenly the crew became agitated, everyone pointing to the east. You turned and saw a gray cloud speeding across the sky straight for the "Gallante". A few of the crewmen leaped overboard. Someone behind your back whispered: "that’s how the fate looks?" and spat heartily on the deck. Then the world became one great gray fog and all you could sense is the movement of tremendous speed... But you could not distinguish the direction or count the time... Slowly you had lost your consciousness... and regained it in what seemed a short instant. The ship is riding shallow waters in a sheltered bay by a stony beach. Captain Havarian approaches you hesitantly...~ [theme3]

Your seasoned captain looks nervous as the ship enters the time gate.   "Athkatla" says he steadily... and the familiar harbor appears in view... You do not stop in the port however, but lay your course straight for Brinnlaw.

-  Bodhi was as good as her word. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliff side.~ [intro8]

Because of that, Aran Linvail was eventually forced to retire. He went with Sime to a small village in Northern Amn where Sime was offered the position of ranger-protector, despite her background.

Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the mace, saving the matching ring for a special time.

Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

-	SAY NAME2 ~The Black Bow~
-	SAY DESC ~A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faerun.  A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart.  Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings.  He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle.  In the lands north of Baldur’s Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm.  Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan’s.  Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan’s home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead.  His farm was burned to the ground.  Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood.  He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with.  Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan’s death, it was blessed by a god.  Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal.  Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan’s actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

He wanted the ability to summon allies at a moment’s notice without giving away his intention.  For that reason, he created a wide variety of chess sets of different colors that would summon constructed, golem-like automatons to aid him in battle.  Almost all of Niri Alud’s chess sets were lost when he was attacked by desert raiders in Calimshan.  The raiders, ignorant of the ways of magic, let most of the chess sets sink into the desert sands.  The chess sets that were taken were soon separated, pieces traveling through trade and theft over hundreds of miles.  Treasure hunters search for the pieces still.

-
-It was a rumor that once upon a time when Aran Linvail was a young adventurer, he fell in love with an elven girl. She was the most beautiful creature he had ever seen in his life. In order to protect his lover in their travels, he asked one of the famous Calimshite merchants to bring him the most invulnerable leather armour he would find. In two months the merchant brought this excellent set of studded leather armour to Aran, but it was too later. His lover was shot dead by a goblin archer in a forest of Tethyr. Aran has kept this armour for a long time in remembrance of his short and passionate love, and eventually bestowed this armour to his favourite guild master.

-	SAY NAME2 ~Selune’s Promise~
-	SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune’s Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora’s luck could not stay with them forever, though.
-
-In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa’s allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa’s former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.
-
-Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.
-
-Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime’s mother.

-	SAY DESC ~An extremely unusual mace, Three White Doves was created by an Ilmaterian priest named Alledec in 850 DR. Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away. This ivory-headed mace was the result. The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory. Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place. The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace. It is carved from pure ivory and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon. The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.
-
-Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace. It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater. The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold. Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest. Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.
