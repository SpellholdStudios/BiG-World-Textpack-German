@0    = ~It’s no concern of yours, Kachiko~
@1    = ~Kachiko, I was never interested in romances. Women are vain, their tears are lies, and their words are poison for a man’s heart.~
@2    = ~Really? Nobles, trying to marry off their silly daughters to the last Corthala told me this one too. I have seen plenty of these daughters, all looking sweet and naïve, and all talking "love at the first sight"... only to run away as soon as they calculated that the last Corthala is worth no more than his name and a hunting cabin. No, I will not play these games! If I could, I would write it across my forehead: "Broke. Not marriage material."~
@3    = ~(*moans and walks away*)~
@4    = ~(*quietly*) Yes, I wish he would be around... may be then I would not have to put up with this squire nonsense... My patience is wearing thin...~
@5    = ~Grrr! Ahem... We’ll talk about it some other time, Mazzy...~
@6    = ~(*whispers back*): Kachiko, dear, wonderful, sweet, precious Kachiko, would you please, please SHUT UP!~
@7    = ~<CHARNAME>, I was wondering if you would allow me to carry Merella’s journal?~
@8    = ~Of course. Take it.~
@9    = ~And what do you need it for, Valygar?~
@10   = ~Do you know Merella then, Valygar?~
@11   = ~Thank you, friend, I appreciate it.~
@12   = ~I’ve known Merella for many years. I wish to return the journal to her if we find her alive. And to keep it in her memory, if against all hope, she is dead.~
@13   = ~I see. Well, you are the best person to keep the journal then. Take it Valygar.~
@14   = ~I will give it to you if you tell me the whole story. I bet that Merella was more than just a childhood friend.~
@15   = ~No, Valygar, I do not think I should give it to you.~
@16   = ~I do not wish to discuss it.~
@17   = ~As you wish.~
@18   = ~Yes, I do. She was a childhood friend.~
@19   = ~Merella... (*he kneels and takes her hand*)... Shh... It’s not important...~
@20   = ~Go in peace, my friend... (*his eyes blur with tears*)~
@21   = ~Valygar... You look lost... I wish I could comfort you, but I am afraid that I would be intruding. If you wish to talk about Merella...~
@22   = ~So what was this lovely neighbor of yours apologizing for? Do I smell a love story?~
@23   = ~You are intruding. Please leave me be.~
@24   = ~That is none of your concern. I do not wish to be sullied by your base suspicion.~
@25   = ~<CHARNAME>, I feel bad about snapping at you when you asked me about Merella.~
@26   = ~Valygar, I am more than pleased with your loyalty to me; you may keep your past to yourself.~
@27   = ~I was overly curious, Valygar. It’s a rare thing to see a man like you in pain... I feel that you cared deeply for her and merely wanted to offer my condolences...~
@28   = ~Oh, no problem. I didn’t take offence. I could see you were upset, and I should not have asked you stupid questions.~
@29   = ~The last thing I wanted was to alienate you like that, <CHARNAME>. I loved Merella when I was very young...~
@30   = ~The romance went badly I presume?~
@31   = ~I know. I loved Merella once. She returned my feelings it seemed, but then I had to go away by my parents bidding. Two years is long time when you are sixteen. When I came back Merella was involved with one of the Immensvale’s lads. It was very painful at the time.~
@32   = ~Valygar, it’s normal to have a broken heart at that age... The only terrible thing is when that causes people to shut down their feelings in the future. I hope that’s didn’t happen in your case.~
@33   = ~If she did not wait for you, then clearly she did not love you enough and did not deserve you. Throw her out of your mind and move on; find yourself someone more worthy of your love.~
@34   = ~You are a wonderful and kind friend. You know, I loved Merella once. She returned my feelings it seemed, but then I had to go away by my parents bidding. Two years is long time when you are sixteen. When I came back Merella was involved with one of the Immensvale’s lads. It was very painful at the time.~
@35   = ~Yes, my perceptive Lady. She returned my feelings it seemed, but then I had to go away by my parents bidding. Two years is long time when you are sixteen. When I came back Merella was involved with one of the Immensvale’s lads. It was very painful at the time.~
@36   = ~I wonder why you would encourage me to make a fool of myself again?~
@37   = ~<CHARNAME>, I can see you are tired. Please allow me to carry your backpack for a while.~
@38   = ~Valygar, really I am fine. I was just thinking about my accursed heritage and it is an exhausting business.~
@39   = ~Valygar, I am perfectly capable of carrying my backpack. Rangers, ha! Always trying to protect you against over exertion, over eating, fighting dragons on your own and everything else harmful on the face of Toril...~
@40   = ~It was very nice of you to offer, but I will manage. Thank you, Valygar.~
@41   = ~There is no harm in asking.~
@42   = ~Well, nothing exhausts your sense of humor at least.~
@43   = ~I wish that you were not so stubborn, <CHARNAME>.~
@44   = ~Tell me... what kind of family did you have?~ [VALYGA68]
@45   = ~I was raised by Gorion in Candlekeep.  He’s the only father I’ve known.~
@46   = ~My family is... best not discussed.~
@47   = ~Why do you ask?~
@48   = ~This is no time to talk, Valygar.~
@49   = ~<CHARNAME> I am not interested in gossip, but there is one rumour, which I cannot lay aside... I have heard people whispering that you are not an ordinary mortal. I find myself almost believing it... You wield strange powers and the look in your eyes is different somehow...~
@50   = ~Valygar, you should not listen to nonsense like that. I am a plain girl from Candlekeep... I was raised by a powerful mage; maybe it rubbed off on me? Who knows...~
@51   = ~You are an observant man, Valygar. I am no ordinary mortal, but a demigod.~
@52   = ~Valygar, you will find out in time what I really am, if you gain my trust and confidence. But now I do not want to speak about it.~
@53   = ~Go on, listen to rumours. You will be told many things about me. I have heard a thing or two about Necromancers from the Corthala family too...~
@54   = ~You said: "was raised"... so, you are an orphan? And you were raised by a MAGE? Not that my childhood was happy, but at least they were my parents... It must have been terrible for you to grow up alone with a cold, old man instead of a family...~
@55   = ~Gorion was not a cold man, Valygar. I know you do not like mages, but Gorion was the best father one could have. He loved me as his own... And I was not alone. Imoen has been my best friend for as long as I can remember, so it’s almost like having a sister.~
@56   = ~Yes, my childhood was lonely and cold. But I control my own destiny now, and let the past bury its dead...~
@57   = ~Hmm... Do we really need to talk about it? Or about anything else?~
@58   = ~Maybe he was your father then?~
@59   = ~Unfortunately not. I owe my life to Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, strange as it might sound...~
@60   = ~No he was not. My family tree is no concern of yours or anybody else for that matter.~
@61   = ~Bhaal... I am sorry that I have been so persistent. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, it must have been very upsetting for you...~
@62   = ~I am sorry... I should not have intruded on you like that. You can keep your secrets.~
@63   = ~You know, that’s my feeling exactly, but unfortunately in my family past does not always stay dead.~
@64   = ~A... demigod? I am not surprised... You have the grace of Sune’s daughter... or are you Eight’s Sister, a child of Mystra?~
@65   = ~Ah, yes, Sune mothered me.~
@66   = ~You got it, Mystra’s blood flows in my veins.~
@67   = ~Unfortunately, neither Sune, nor Mystra are my parents. The god of Murder was my father.~
@68   = ~You will find out sooner or later anyway. I am Bhaal’s cursed spawn.~
@69   = ~I am curious.  How much experience have you had with magic?~ [VALYGA67]
@70   = ~I am a mage, Valygar.  My experience with magic is quite thorough, I assure you.  Why do you ask?~
@71   = ~As a cleric I gain my magic through the worship of my god.  Why do you ask?~
@72   = ~I have had considerable encounters with magic throughout my travels, Valygar, if that’s what you mean.~
@73   = ~This is no time for chatter, Valygar.~
@74   = ~May I ask you for your opinion on something?~ [VALYGA69]
@75   = ~If you wish.~
@76   = ~We haven’t time for this, Valygar.~
@77   = ~You have all a mortal can wish for. You are beautiful beyond belief, your aim is true and your mind is sharp. Yet you search for arcane knowledge. Do you not think that is too much of power for one person?~
@78   = ~No power is enough for me, Valygar. I can feel that one day I shall walk among gods as an equal.~
@79   = ~You are exaggerating, Valygar. My only talent is magic and I work hard to develop it...~
@80   = ~I had no choice in the matter really. Magic manifests itself through me...~
@81   = ~I never put all my eggs in one basket... I am a mage by day, a minstrel in the eve and a thief by night... I need many trades in order to survive. Life is harsh, Valygar...~
@82   = ~I cannot agree more! I should have been made a RANGER! But that button pusher by the keyboard made me a MAGE!  Tell you what, Valygar, let’s imagine we are in NWN and I am dualed to a ranger? What do you think?~
@83   = ~There is nothing wrong with studying the Arcane if one does not abuse power.~
@84   = ~I have been watching you fight. You are a very brave woman and you make wise choices. Yet, considering your heritage, the passion I see in you disturbs me.~
@85   = ~I do not need a lecture on moral issues, Valygar. In fact, I find your attention to everything I do annoying.~
@86   = ~You think so?~
@87   = ~I do not see how I am different from anyone else. Maybe you are confused.~
@88   = ~I see. Well, just do not hurt yourself when you will be plunged down from the skies... dreamer.~
@89   = ~And that’s what worries me. You are already a master of your trade, what could you become?~
@90   = ~I... I feel sorry for you then.~
@91   = ~Let’s hear you singing then, my dear friend. May be your infatuation with magic will not last.~
@92   = ~I do not understand...~
@93   = ~Never mind, let’s just go, RANGER!~
@94   = ~You’re right. I won’t bother you any longer.~
@95   = ~Oh, you will be surprised how easy it is to overstep the boundaries.~
@96   = ~I am not sure. I avoid interfering with the business of gods, yet I would not like the taint to change you into a merciless killing machine. I’ve spent many years fighting my family’s calling to necromancy and arcane magic in myself. It must be a much harder battle for you.~
@97   = ~I fear it myself Valygar and I watch my heart carefully. I will not let the Bhaal essence take over.~
@98   = ~What’s your problem, ranger? I am Bhaal’s spawn and I am not as shy of the callings of my blood as you are.~
@99   = ~You are being too grim. I do not notice any evil influences in me. Surely men point their fingers and call me names, and maniacs like Irenicus hunt me, and I have nightmares sometimes... Hmmm, maybe there is something evil around me, but it is not of my making. ~
@100  = ~I am surely glad to hear that.~
@101  = ~Indeed, my advice was useless then.~
@102  = ~I think I worried needlessly. You are far too cheerful to be consumed by the God of Murder.~
@103  = ~I hope so. Magical energies are very subtle. They penetrate and poison your soul before you are aware of it. I’ve spent many years fighting my family’s calling to necromancy and the arcane magic in my blood. It must be a much harder battle for you. I would not want the taint to change you into a merciless killing machine.~
@104  = ~You shiver? Here, I’d make the fire burn higher. Move closer, <CHARNAME>, and the chill will pass. Let me warm you hands up, they look positively blue...~
@105  = ~There is no need, Valygar. I am quite comfortable, thank you.~
@106  = ~Valygar, it’s very... helpful to have you around. And your hands are so warm...~
@107  = ~Ranger, stop rushing around like a mad hen. I am going dizzy from your jolting back and forth. And your hands are too rough! You have scratched me already. Be gone.~
@108  = ~I do not think so, <CHARNAME>. But suit yourself.~
@109  = ~I am just doing my job, looking after a traveler in need... Are you feeling better? Yes, I can feel your fingers are not cold any longer.  Look, the water is boiling... I’d make you a mug of a nice herbal brew...~
@110  = ~I feel like I just got a grandma, I never had...~
@111  = ~Herbal brew? I do not know... Last time Jaheira made one, I had to accidentally spill it...~
@112  = ~I want nothing, thank you. I think I will call it a day. Good night.~
@113  = ~Be a good girl then, drink up the tea, your old granny Valygar made for you and then go sleep, and I will tuck the blankets around you...~
@114  = ~...and do not forget a lullaby... Thank you, Valygar, and good night to you...~
@115  = ~Slow down, Valygar. You are not coming near my bedroll...~
@116  = ~Oups... I am so clumsy... I spilt the tea... What a waste, it was really good...~
@117  = ~Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@118  = ~What a waste! It was exceptionally good. But it’s too late to boil another pot, so my advice would be for you to get under your warmest blanket and sleep peacefully through the night.~
@119  = ~I will try, Valygar. I will really try.~
@120  = ~Thank you, Valygar. Good night.~
@121  = ~I hope your nightmares will leave you be tonight.~
@122  = ~Well... But it’s good for you. Be a good girl then, drink up the tea... Here we go, not that bad, was it? Now, my advice would be for you to get under your warmest blanket and sleep peacefully through the night.~
@123  = ~I wish we’d spend less time in the city. I keep thinking I am going to run into some empty-headed noble who will try to involve me in endless, trivial small talk.~
@124  = ~Fear not, my friend, we are leaving very soon for better places than this cramped over-grown village. By the way Valygar, speaking of the nobility, what is your proper title?~
@125  = ~I rather enjoy the city. Small talk is no big danger. By the way Valygar, speaking of the nobility, what’s your proper title?~
@126  = ~Valygar, can you stop complaining for once? Next thing you’re gonna say is that the evil magic users are ruling Athkatla.~
@127  = ~That would be pleasant. As for your question, I am a Count.~
@128  = ~Count Valygar Corthala? I am honored to have you in my party, your Lordship.~
@129  = ~I’d be grateful if you’d spare me this nonsense. I am a woodsman, not a ballroom twit.~
@130  = ~We all have our peculiarities. If you really need to know, I am a Count.~
@131  = ~How grand! Count Valygar Corthala and humble <CHARNAME> have left the sewers and are proceeding to the Copper Coronet to mix with the refined society there.~
@132  = ~I knew that you would make fun of it. Well, at least my useless title puts a smile on your face.~
@133  = ~(*He looks surprised*) Indeed they are, my friend. Their tentacles worm their way into every aspects of life in Amn.~
@134  = ~Oh, shut up. I am bored already.~
@135  = ~Where is the distinction between a mercenary and a great hero?  When people listen to a bard’s tale they forget how they tend to avoid those called "adventurers" at all costs in normal life. I look at you and I see that you live minute by minute. You rarely have time to stop and enjoy your life. They call you a hero; is it enough for you? Is it what you live for?~
@136  = ~What is a hero but a person without a choice? I wish I had never been thrown out on the road, but I am a survivor and I did my best under the circumstances. If they call me a hero for that - so be it. I would be much happier in Candlekeep. On the other hand, if it hadn’t been for me fighting Saverok, Candlekeep might have been destroyed in the war my half-brother was devising.~
@137  = ~What else is there to live for, Valygar? The quiet lifestyle is not for me! I am no commoner. I was destined for great deeds. I always knew that one day my name would be known by all. I would rather have it praised than cursed.~
@138  = ~I am not a hero, Valygar. I am trying to set things right, that’s all. I am very tired of that, but if not me - then who? I sincerely hope that among the endless battles I will not become a bloodthirsty monster, enjoying death and bringing it to everyone in my wake, friend and foe alike.~
@139  = ~Let them ramble, Valygar. I care for one thing only: the spoils of victory. Those who are not with me are against me - it’s as simple as that. Why over-complicate the matter?~
@140  = ~Then you have done marvelously, my friend. I am proud to know you. One day you might get back to the candlelight, soft music, old books and solitude. I hope that will make you happier, than the dreary roads and bloody battles.~
@141  = ~It will never be the same, Valygar. Gorion is dead. I made and lost many friends. I discovered my true nature. I cannot go back as if nothing has happened.~
@142  = ~Yes, Valygar, that’s what I’ll do eventually. I will try to forget the adventures, the dirt, the blood and the chanced road companions, as if it was a nightmare.~
@143  = ~Solitude? Why did you say that? I knew many interesting people back home.~
@144  = ~Valygar, you put me in a rotten mood. I do not want to talk about that or anything else with you.~
@145  = ~Do you believe in fate?~
@146  = ~Yes I do. I have all reason to. I came to this world by the will of a dead god. My life is affected by prophecy.~
@147  = ~Not really, but I believe that I was given the means to become a hero. Now I can refute it or I can take it and use it. I say, use it. I might get help from that mage, Irenicus and then...~
@148  = ~Do you?~
@149  = ~My friend, I am proud to know you. I sincerely hope that the monster does not overtake your beautiful soul.~
@150  = ~Quit this, Valygar. You embarrass me.~
@151  = ~Your support means a lot to me. You are a valiant man and I value your friendship.~
@152  = ~What do you know of my soul? You act like we have been friends for ages!~
@153  = ~Why indeed? Thank you for being honest.~
@154  = ~I know what you mean, <CHARNAME>. I cannot walk past the Corthala’s former house without shivering. After what happened with my parents even happy memories hurt me. But you look sad now and I do not want to upset you even further. Just know that I will do anything I can to help you to get your peace.~
@155  = ~I am glad to hear that...~
@156  = ~Of course. My mistake. I imagined Candlekeep as a very secluded place. A nice person like you must have friends everywhere she goes.~
@157  = ~I-I’m sorry, <CHARNAME>...I didn’t mean to bother you.  I’ll talk to somebody else, instead.~
@158  = ~(*smiles*) You have reason, indeed. So you are a hero against your own will. But you look sad now and I do not want to upset you even further. Just know that I will do anything I can to help you to get your peace.~
@159  = ~Well, if it is the help of the evil wizard you are seeking, do not expect much of compassion from me.~
@160  = ~(*laughs*) Cheater! When I think of the way we met, I start believing in fate. But I guess you are in no mood for more questions. I’ll leave you be then.~
@161  = ~I feel that way, <CHARNAME>. Indeed, it is not warranted by the short time I spent adventuring in your company, but I think of you as of one of my closest friends. I have to confess that I was studying you. I have compiled the most full collection of your faults and sins. But I also notice the emptiness and monotony of the other people. I will not hide that I seek your friendship.~
@162  = ~That’s outrageous! I forbid you to spy on me.~
@163  = ~I guess all I can do is to give you a nervous smile. But try not to spy on me too much, Stalker.~
@164  = ~Your interest... flatters me somehow. I do not know why. You must be a very discrete man, since I have not noticed your prying.~
@165  = ~(*smile mischievously*) So what is my greatest sin?~
@166  = ~I am glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. My loyalty to you is not the blind loyalty of a soldier. It is the loyalty of a friend.~
@167  = ~I--I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bring it up that way.~
@168  = ~Please, do not think that I spy on you, <CHARNAME>. I cannot help but notice what you say and what you do.~
@169  = ~Being so incredibly beautiful that it makes me dizzy, of course.~
@170  = ~Wherever we go there are temples...  So much effort to build houses for those who do not need homes. I cannot deny the beauty of it, but it pains me to see people placing their hopes in gods instead of taking charge of their own destiny.~
@171  = ~You are too harsh.  Gods are part of our world and their patronage is important. A paladin in his righteous charge calls for Torm, a fierce Northerner dies with Tempus’ name on his lips and the poor find much consolation in Ilmater’s embrace.~
@172  = ~You are a ranger, aren’t you supposed to worship Mielikki?~
@173  = ~I am not in a mood for a spiritual discussion.~
@174  = ~May be... may be not.~
@175  = ~And Cyric would enjoy the destruction, Gond will encourage an inventor of a destructive weapon, capable of killing thousands innocent on a spot, Lloth had turned a whole race into her slaves and she is ever on the look out for new victims... How are gods better than we are? They are capricious, corrupt and cruel. All they ever seek is power and thralls.~
@176  = ~Valygar, the gods are part of the balance of the realms. If you wish, then do not worship, but do not deny others the guidance and support of their chosen god.~
@177  = ~You think you have all the answers don’t you? I won’t want to listen to your miserable meanderings again.~
@178  = ~This dispute is better left for another time. Let’s hurry now, Valygar.~
@179  = ~I think, you are right... I have been arrogant. You are wiser than I, my friend, am.~
@180  = ~Supposed? I owe nothing to gods! I do not worship Mielikki. Many of my fellow rangers worship the Lady of the Forest out of loneliness. Even the strongest person needs company sometimes and prayer becomes a substitute for a friendship and conversation. But I am luckier, for I have a beautiful Lady by my side; real flesh and blood. And her heart is kind and open to the complaints of a humble woodsman.~
@181  = ~Why does it always come back to me, no matter where your conversation started?~
@182  = ~Fascinating! But let’s get moving...~
@183  = ~This conversation is becoming too odd... I’d rather not know why lonely rangers in the woods worship Meilikki.~
@184  = ~Truly, I wonder why myself.~
@185  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>, I apologize.~
@186  = ~Sorry to bother you then.~
@187  = ~The way you said it... as if I am a child, who dares to talk of things he does not rightly understand. Your connection with divine runs deeper than mine. I can see that I have annoyed you. Forgive me, <CHARNAME>... I meant no disrespect.~
@188  = ~I have seen this look before. Why are you surprised that I keep a book in my backpack? Not much to compare to the former glory of the Corthala’s library of course, but I cherish it and I would not be without it.~
@189  = ~I was not surprised that you have a book with you, I was just pondering on what book it might be.~
@190  = ~Book? What book?~
@191  = ~You can read?~
@192  = ~It’s a collection of stories about mariners and explorers... About those "whose chest is saturated not with the dust of the lost scrolls, but with the salt of the Seas. Of those who marks with a needle their dare route on a worn map..."~
@193  = ~The Corthala’s did have a library... What a beautiful passage. Who said it?~
@194  = ~I should have guessed. It suits your character. I will leave you to your reading then.~
@195  = ~Slow down, Corthala. I have seen enough books in Candelkeep to last a lifetime.~
@196  = ~In this case, we have nothing to discuss. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@197  = ~A man of great virtue, I am sure. Unfortunately, I do not know his name. My father used to read me the whole poem, but I remember only few lines. My father... he became a mage, but he dreamt of something gentler before my mother dominated his mind entirely...~
@198  = ~Oh, I am sorry, I thought you were looking my way.~
@199  = ~No, I was not.~
@200  = ~No, I did not notice it, but now after you brought it up, I am curious what sort of book would Valygar Corthala carry with him?~
@201  = ~Yes, I can.~
@202  = ~It was a bad joke, do not get offended, please. So, what book was it?~
@203  = ~Amazing! I learn something new about you every day.~
@204  = ~I can never get used to seeing you without your fighting gear. My fearless leader, ready for anything and seemingly knowing no doubts. Yet you suddenly look soft and gentle and so beautiful...~
@205  = ~But I still am your leader, and as such I order you to shut your mouth and get lost!~
@206  = ~What was that? A compliment? Or are you accusing me of destroying your image of me?~
@207  = ~Valygar, what were you drinking at dinner?~
@208  = ~I did not mean to anger you, <CHARNAME>. I just wanted to say... Oh well, never mind. I am no good at this.~
@209  = ~It’s the truth. You are a beautiful woman and a leader I am proud to follow.~
@210  = ~That was a compliment then? Valygar, I was not expecting one from you. I didn’t think that you were a lady’s man.~
@211  = ~Valygar, I am sorry... it was a bad joke. Your words made me feel vulnerable for some reason.~
@212  = ~Actually it was a very sweet thing to say. I should have thanked you instead of exercising my wit. Can I compensate with an "I’m sorry" kiss?~
@213  = ~I am not. But you are an unusual lady...~
@214  = ~Unusual lady? You mean all that Child of Bhaal stuff?~
@215  = ~(*You roll your eyes and groan audibly.*) Valygar, this conversation... I do not like where it is leading. Let’s stop right here.~
@216  = ~No, not Bhaal. I think that you are much braver, and more honest, kind and intelligent then any woman I have met before.~
@217  = ~If you say so.~
@218  = ~You should not be shy... I think that you are much braver, more honest, kind and intelligent then any woman I have met before, and as such you should be used to compliments by now.~
@219  = ~You do not have to... No, no... Kissing on a forehead is reserved for grandpas; people of our age should kiss with their lips... mmmgh...~
@220  = ~Only water.~
@221  = ~I feel so free and yet strangely empty, now that Lavok is dead... What did you think of him, <CHARNAME>?~
@222  = ~I liked the old man... After all he was a Corthala, and I think Corthala males are the most handsome of men. Lavok would have been my prime choice for a lover. Too bad, he is pushing up daisies now.~
@223  = ~Lavok was your nemesis, Valygar, and he nearly finished us all. I pitied him, but I was relieved when he died. We shall forget the dead monster and try to remember the man he once was...~
@224  = ~Nothing really... He was your adversary, not mine. I am focusing all my thoughts on Irenicus.~
@225  = ~What? What are you talking about? Woman, are you ever serious?~
@226  = ~If I was serious, I’d have to hang myself this very minute. I am hunting a mad wizard of immense power, Imoen is missing, my former companions are dead...~
@227  = ~I can be serious. When I sleep. That’s when I have nightmares...~
@228  = ~Do you really want me to be serious?~
@229  = ~I am an idiot. Of course, after all you went through, it’s a miracle that you can still laugh and try to cheer up others. Who cares about a dead lich anyway? Forget I asked. But what was that about Corthala males?~
@230  = ~I said I think Corthala males are very handsome, Valygar... but I guess now only one remains...~
@231  = ~You are a wonderful person, Valygar. If I were not seriously involved already, I would fall for you on the spot...~
@232  = ~Nothing Valygar.~
@233  = ~Hmph!~
@234  = ~I do not know. I hated him, I loathed him and now I do not know. He was so pitiful, pleading for death... I think I created my own menace. As for enjoying life... I think I am finally starting to live.~
@235  = ~Whatever, let’s just keep moving.~
@236  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, you are a great comfort.~
@237  = ~Oh.  Of...of course, my <LADYLORD>.  As you wish.~
@238  = ~Yes, of course. You helped me to enter the Sphere and defeat Lavok, and for that I am grateful. I cannot expect you to help me in my soul searching as well.~
@239  = ~It is a sad day for me. Some years ago on this day my friend had fallen in battle. He was a wonderful man and he was so full of life. I wailed that day in pain, I felt as if my skin was ripped off me and I could not stop asking myself: why it was not I that met the arrow?~
@240  = ~Some of my friends died, some left my side... It is scary how difficult it is to find true friends and how easy it is to loose them. And the pain is terrible.~
@241  = ~Sorry to hear that Valygar. But on the battlefield people fall. It is inevitable.~
@242  = ~Valygar, I have no interest in this gruesome story.~
@243  = ~Yes. He died in one of those pointless skirmishes on the border. It was not an orcish arrow that cut him down. A human, like myself, let it fly. A human who could have been my friend. I chased him in the battle, I sought him out and I attacked him that day.~
@244  = ~Valygar, you do not have to continue...~
@245  = ~Did you kill him?~
@246  = ~Ranger, I am in no mood for this, leave me be. ~
@247  = ~I wanted to tell you that. Can I?~
@248  = ~If that will make you feel better, yes.~
@249  = ~Sure thing. Good stuff. ~
@250  = ~No, I do not want to hear another word from you.~
@251  = ~I did not kill him. I could not. I thought that it would only multiply grief in the world, and it would not console me. He may still have a scar on the base of his neck, where my blade stopped. Next day I quit the army service. I will fight monsters, I will fight those who endanger the innocent, but I refuse to kill simply because I am ordered to.~
@252  = ~You take my orders to kill.~
@253  = ~Even your own parents?~
@254  = ~There is no thing worse and crueller than a sword wielded mindlessly. I praise your choice, Count Corthala.~
@255  = ~You were weak. But I can understand that your friend’s death grieved you.~
@256  = ~That I do. I know what is your cause. It is a noble one: to rescue your friend from the Cowled Wizards. I would not follow you if I was not sure of that.~
@257  = ~Apparently.~
@258  = ~Oh, Valygar, I am sorry. I did not mean to cause you more pain. Every time I look at you I cannot chase away the scary thoughts. I keep hearing in my head "Yet each man kills the thing he loves..." ~
@259  = ~Good. A sign of a true fighter for goodness. Justice is blind.~
@260  = ~Just do not start telling me that story all over again. One time was enough.~
@261  = ~I do not think that my story is what you are thinking it is. I did not kill the man. And I quit the army the next day. I am ready to fight monsters, I am ready to fight those who endanger the innocent, but I refuse to kill simply because I am ordered to.~
@262  = ~And so do I. <CHARNAME> trust me, I thought it over thousand times and I can neither forget, nor forgive myself. Valygar Corthala, the man who killed his parents and walked away unpunished. It’s a contradiction, just like everything else in my life: I am a Count without inheritance, a noble without a family, a soldier without an army, a murderer without a crime.~
@263  = ~Valygar, there is no thing worse and crueller than a sword wielded mindlessly. I cannot imagine the pain nested in your soul. May be that’s why you do not trust the gods? But I accept your choices, Count Corthala. I think so should you.~
@264  = ~I cannot bear this nonsense anymore. You are a good fighter, but all that psycho-babble is unnerving me. Can you talk less?~
@265  = ~I knew you would understand. My gentle friend, the more I know you, the more I admire you.~
@266  = ~I do not think I shall talk to you again at all.~
@267  = ~You think so? I do not.~
@268  = ~Do you miss Candlekeep? I guess what I mean to ask is do you think of Candlekeep as of your home? A place you would want to return eventually?~
@269  = ~No way. I never liked living in Candlekeep with its funny, bookish monks and the narrow outlook of a small town.~
@270  = ~Yes, I would. In Candlekeep my childhood memories live on... is Gorion’s grave is nearby. Imoen and I dug it together... I feel connected to it and I will return.~
@271  = ~I have no particular feeling. But it’s a pleasant enough place. Folks are kindly. But you would not like it there.~
@272  = ~Was there any place you felt like you belong too?~
@273  = ~Large cities full of people, like Athkatla or Baldur’s Gate attract me. I think that after adventuring days are over, I’ll find a nice house with an ocean view and settle there for good.~
@274  = ~Wilderness of course. I could never understand why would one need other people around. Trees, beasts and birds are all the company I seek and I am happy with them.~
@275  = ~I never gave it a thought, and I am not about to start now.~
@276  = ~My family used to own a mansion in the Government district. I did not like it that much. I do not like cities... however Athkatla... Athkatla is different. Its streets are narrow as animal’s trails and people act like beasts... (*laughs*)... I wouldn’t say that I liked Athkatla, but I’m fond of it in a way. It is strange, that me a big city boy prefers small places far from the madding crowd and you, coming from just such a place would want to live in a big city. My door will always be open for you if you want to stay with me for a time.~
@277  = ~Thank you Valygar, it’s very nice of you to invite me.~
@278  = ~Valygar, I would not want to associate with you after our adventures are over. I have different plans.~
@279  = ~It is my pleasure, as always.~
@280  = ~You are my soul mate then? But sometimes the loneliness of the woods is too much for a person to bear... Trust me, I know. One needs friends even if he chooses solitude.~
@281  = ~I know Valygar. I am glad to have trusted companions with me. I would imagine some would come by to trade a tale or two in my humble lodge.~
@282  = ~Solitude is fine with me. I never feel lonely. And I am so tired of your prattling.~
@283  = ~I know that I would.~
@284  = ~As you wish. I was merely curious.~
@285  = ~The Umar Hills are like that for me... Though both of my parents are buried in Athkatla... But my father used to go hunting with me in the Hills. He was not capable of shooting an arrow straight, yet he did it for my sake... He was very kind and gentle person. I think of him and of the happy times we shared when I go there. I guess that’s the same feeling you have for Candlekeep. I think I’d like to visit it one day.~
@286  = ~You would not like Candlekeep, Valygar . It’s full of mages and life revolves around the library.~
@287  = ~Why not? But it is difficult to gain an entry. You have to pay 10,000 gold pieces or carry a book of particular value... It is a really peculiar rule, but it is effective in keeping almost everyone out and in expanding the library.~
@288  = ~If you lived there maybe you could help me to scale the wall or something... That’s my only hope, because the Corthala’s book collection is gone and I do not own much.~
@289  = ~Why? Because the place is full of mages? I guess I’ve managed to create a negative impression on you, haven’t I? I can manage to stay civil and not rush to kill every spellcaster in sight... if they are peaceful... or dead. I guess you are right, the place is not for me.~
@290  = ~I never was one to pray to gods, but after what has happened to you I wish I could ask for someone more powerful than I to protect you, <CHARNAME>. I would not beg for my own empty soul, the soul of a wanderer without relations, but I would beg for the defense of this innocent girl, tormented by Bhaal. Is there no spirit warm and kind enough in this world to protect you?~
@291  = ~Thank... thank you. The shadow has passed and I pray that it will never happen again. I am so scared, Valygar.~
@292  = ~Cut it out! Look at yourself: you are pale and tremble like a leaf in the wind. I am no innocent, you idiot! Power is coming to me. I do not know how to control it yet, but soon enough I will.~
@293  = ~Valygar, gods are of no help, do not call for them. Help me chase down Irenicus and rip MY soul out of his body and I shall be whole again.~
@294  = ~Protect me? Protect me against whom or what? From myself? I am a Bhaalspawn (*you laugh bitterly*).~
@295  = ~My dear... It hurts me to see you like this. Nobody should have to go through torture like this and you in particular. I wait impatiently for the day when that evil mage pays for his crimes against you.~
@296  = ~That day will come soon, I swear. And when it comes I will be glad to have a trusted companion like you by my side.~
@297  = ~Irenicus has committed many crimes. He has killed and tortured so many. He will pay for all of them when at last we confront him.~
@298  = ~Valygar, I can see that you are upset, but please, calm down.~
@299  = ~That’s what I am here for, <CHARNAME>.~
@300  = ~Yes, well, we should be going. I am fine now. Thank you. ~
@301  = ~Then the Evil got its grip on you...~
@302  = ~Come here and let me hold you for a moment. I know it’s just an illusion but I feel like I am protecting you from the evils of the world.~
@303  = ~I am glad you’re feeling better. Men are all alike.~
@304  = ~Now that you have mentioned that, I do have the feeling of being protected... It is very safe here within your strong arms, Valygar.~
@305  = ~(*whisper*) Are you mad? What would the others think?~
@306  = ~Do you really care?~
@307  = ~No, let them talk... (*let Valygar hold you*)~
@308  = ~Yes! (*you walk away from Valygar*)~
@309  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, nothing is clear to me anymore...~
@310  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@311  = ~Oh, most powerful mistress, might a humble servant address you with a word of praise?~
@312  = ~(*loudly*)  Silence, male!  (*quietly*)  Are you out of your mind? You will get us all killed.~
@313  = ~I am willing to listen, but it’d better be a good one or I’ll throw you to the spiders.~
@314  = ~Mmmmgh... (*quietly*)  Who knows how a typical female drow would react? Oh, what the heck...  (*loudly*)  Out with it, male!~
@315  = ~(*Bows low and retreats to his place in line*)~
@316  = ~My most powerful mistress, your prowess in battle is unparalleled. The shine of your hair is brighter than mithril, your grace is unrivaled...~
@317  = ~Shut up male. One more word and you are a drider.~
@318  = ~Nice, but I’ve had enough, Valygar.~
@319  = ~You are stupid... but you amuse me. Your insolence is forgiven. Now fall back in line.~
@320  = ~Really? But I’ve only just started.~
@321  = ~You breath differently when you sleep... I am not surprised that your sleep is disturbed, with the terrifying events of the past few days on your mind. It is strange, but among all our troubles, what worries me the most is being a drow... I am afraid that the change is not just cosmetic.~
@322  = ~Valygar, I am not alone here if you take my meaning, please, go away.~
@323  = ~Not cosmetic? You mean you are turning into a real drow? That could be dangerous.~
@324  = ~Hmm, Valygar, I am not sure I follow you. Maybe if you rest, you will feel better? You know, we need to pretend to be drow if there is any hope to get to Irenicus.~
@325  = ~Yes, yes, I understand. I am sorry. I shall go now and I will try not to bother you with words of this sort.~
@326  = ~Dangerous? I am not sure it is dangerous to anyone but myself. When I look at you I start thinking like a drow would think of a female, a powerful, attractive female... And  I wonder: what if...~
@327  = ~What if... what?~
@328  = ~I am not sure I follow...~
@329  = ~I have heard enough, please leave me be.~
@330  = ~What if I could extend my hand and touch your cheek? What if I could hold you in my arms and kiss you? I dream about you. These caverns, they are so narrow and dark, and the air is stifling. I must be hallucinating...~
@331  = ~Ouch, that’s bad. Must be cavern air for sure. Listen, soon we will be out of here. Let me know if your sickness does not diminish after we leave the Underdark. We will get some priest to take a look at you...~
@332  = ~So you think it’s some sort of madness? Maybe if you do what you were thinking of you will feel better?~
@333  = ~(*stay silent*)~
@334  = ~Valygar, we are in Ust Natha. We cannot talk about things like that, someone might hear and our disguise would fail. Can we talk about it after we are back on the surface?~
@335  = ~Yes, I will. Thank you for talking to me about this.~
@336  = ~No, that would be real madness. I found in you a friend and a person I trust and respect. I cannot destroy it by acting like a foolish boy who knows no restraint. I shall go now and I will try not to bother you with words of this sort.~
@337  = ~Yes, I understand, and you cannot reply to my madness. But the true madness would be for me to hide this from you and look at you and hope... Passion is silent. When it is dressed in words, it does not seem so unconquerable. I found in you a friend and a person I can trust and respect. I cannot destroy it by acting like a foolish boy who knows no restraint. I shall go now and I will try not to bother you with words of this sort.~
@338  = ~I dream about you. I see you with me, and I embrace you and kiss you... These caverns, they are so narrow and dark, and the air is stifling. I must be hallucinating. ~
@339  = ~I know that. Our companions are fast asleep; I see no spying eyes around us for once, so I can speak. Besides, my emotions are strange, and they are quite fitting to our disguise. When I look at you I start thinking like a drow would think of a female, a powerful, attractive female... and I wonder: what if...~
@340  = ~I must tell you, <CHARNAME>, how sorry I feel about our last conversation. Please, do not avoid me. I should not have told you so much, but it was the only way I could stop myself from throwing myself at your feet and begging for your favour. Now away from the Underdark, I am in control of myself again.~
@341  = ~Apology accepted. We were cooped up in the drow city, it’s understandable that you spoke out of turn. But watch your tongue from now on.~
@342  = ~Valygar, it really did not offend me, I am already in a serious stable relationship, and what other men think does not bother me.~
@343  = ~So in other words I am just a traveling companion once more and you have no clue why in the Nine Hells you could have been attracted to me. I am so flattered, Valygar!~
@344  = ~You know, if that is what it takes for you to be honest about your feelings then you should have stayed in Ust Natha. Think about moving there, Valygar.~
@345  = ~No harm done. I am still thinking about what you have said, and it makes me blush... but really, no harm done. We are still friends.~
@346  = ~Thank you, my friend. I appreciate you being so considerate. However, I am a rough woodsman, a man on the run, a fugitive from the law... The Cowled Wizards would never forgive me slaying one of their... I will never be able to live anywhere openly in Amn. I have nothing worthy to throw to your feet. How can I even dare to ask for your attention?~
@347  = ~No, I did not mean it like that. You are a wonderfully beautiful and intelligent woman... Any man would loose his head from your slightest smile. And you deserve the most beautiful and precious things in life, you deserve boundless adoration and love... and stability... And what am I?  A rough woodsman, a man on the run, a fugitive from the law... The Cowled Wizards will never forgive me slaying one of their own... I will never be able to live anywhere openly in Amn. I have nothing worthy to throw to your feet. How can I even dare to ask for your attention?~
@348  = ~Hmm, Valygar...~
@349  = ~(*Valygar takes hold of your hand and kisses it. He shakes his head negatively and walks away before you can say anything*)~
@350  = ~My true feelings? Do you really want to know how I feel? A rough woodsman, a man on the run, a fugitive from the law... The Cowled Wizards would never forgive me slaying one of their... I will never be able to live anywhere openly in Amn. I have nothing worthy to throw to your feet. How can I even dare to ask for your attention? (*Valygar storms away*)~
@351  = ~Listen, Valygar...~
@352  = ~You know, I keep this trinket... This necklace should be worn by a young and beautiful lady, not be stuffed in a dirty backpack. Would you take it?~
@353  = ~You own a string of pearls? No end of surprises from you ranger. Is it not a bit... awkward for the strong and silent type?~
@354  = ~Just sell it; we need money for more important things than beads on a string... beautiful as they may be...~
@355  = ~Thank you Valygar, it’s very beautiful... It feels unusual, is it magical?~
@356  = ~It belonged to Abyssina Corthala, my mother. I sold everything, but this after my parents passed away. I remember playing with it when I was very small, and when she was not yet completely oblivious to my existence. It’s magical of course.~
@357  = ~It is an important family relic for you. I cannot accept it, Valygar.~
@358  = ~It might be useful. Do you mind though if I give it to someone else... depending on what it does, I might not be the right person to wear it.~
@359  = ~I want you to have it. Here, stand still, while I fasten it... It looks beautiful on you, <CHARNAME>. If you do not want to wear it yourself... I guess you can give it back to me... or lend it to someone else... it’s yours. Do what you wish with it.~
@360  = ~Well, yes, it’s yours, do what you wish with it. Yet it would look beautiful on you.~
@361  = ~Yes, it’s beautiful. It belonged to Abyssina Corthala, my mother, and it is magical. I’d rather keep it if you do not want it.~
@362  = ~You know what fascinates me when I look at the brave adventuring ladies?~
@363  = ~No, and I have no use for your opinion anyway.~
@364  = ~No, but please tell me, Valygar.~
@365  = ~I...I must seem very foolish to you, I suppose. I will not bother you again, <CHARNAME>.~
@366  = ~We fight the same battles, we walk the same roads, yet the ladys’ hair is always neatly braided. When and how they do it is beyond me.~
@367  = ~Ever heard of a haircut, Valygar?~
@368  = ~(*smile*) Is this a masqueraded plea for help? Come, sit down, I’ll see what can be done with your unruly mane, ranger.~
@369  = ~Really? I have never noticed any difference after helmets are on.~
@370  = ~Yes, and I so yearn for it.~
@371  = ~You are going to braid my hair? Whom do you think I am, an effete elf? Nay, I’ll just tie them all up with a leather band.~
@372  = ~I guess. Are demigods ever wrong?~
@373  = ~A strange thing has happened this morning, I was walking about and found these little purple flowers. Before I knew what I was doing I had picked a bunch and I don’t have the heart to throw them away. Yet, before anybody else sees me carrying them around, would you mind taking the flowers? To save me the embarrassment?~
@374  = ~Those are violets. I wonder where did you manage to find them this time of the year? I would wear them, but my attire is hardly fitting...~
@375  = ~Valygar, would you mind giving it to somebody else? It’s not that I do not like the flowers, but...~
@376  = ~Now you are bringing me flowers... What’s next? Are you going to ask to hold my hand before our next battle?~
@377  = ~Still more fitting then mine... Of course I can try to arrange them in the seam of my armour or attach them to my helmet... But <CHARNAME> please, do not make me do it...~
@378  = ~All right, I’ll try to find a place for them... near my heart of course.~
@379  = ~No way. I will look just as ridiculous as you. I am an adventurer after all. Would you mind giving the flowers to someone else instead?~
@380  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@381  = ~Of course, forgive my stupidity.~
@382  = ~No, no, do not worry about that. I am a woodsman, not a ballroom twit or a paladin... And I am fighting with you, not participating in some silly jousting competition. I assure you, taking the flowers would not be followed by bad poetry reciting or piling dragonheads at your feet. Will you take the flowers?~
@383  = ~All right, I’ll try to find a place for them... near my heart of course... And I see no harm in couple of dragon heads or perhaps a very short poem, just don’t go overboard.~
@384  = ~Hmm, say <CHARNAME> if you were to... love a man, what kind of a man that would be?~
@385  = ~A silent one.~
@386  = ~Valygar, are you deaf and blind? Are you the only one who does not know? See this man over there? I love him and I am practically married to him. I hope that answers your question~
@387  = ~Since my childhood I have read about brave knights in shining armour... One day I’ll fall for one of those noble paladins, for sure.~
@388  = ~A strong man, who can win any battle and who has considerable bravery. I’d have to do the thinking though.~
@389  = ~A man of the wild, may be a bit sombre. A man who is capable, if a little shy of his emotions.~
@390  = ~A person with a golden tongue and light character.~
@391  = ~A man who can wield magical energies and cast spells.~
@392  = ~A rogue, travelling Faerun, believing that all he sees can be his.~
@393  = ~A man who is close to nature and strives to maintain the balance.~
@394  = ~A man who speaks to gods.~
@395  = ~Oh...of course, <CHARNAME>.  I didn’t mean to bother you.~
@396  = ~(*smiles*) That is a wise choice, <CHARNAME>. ~
@397  = ~  Surely.~
@398  = ~Oh...~
@399  = ~Do not get your hopes too high though, I was speaking in general terms.~
@400  = ~And a man who I have never before seen blush.~
@401  = ~You cannot be serious.~
@402  = ~I must caution you against such a choice. Mages... they are just too consumed by their studies to really love and have family...~
@403  = ~Valygar, look at sorcerers, they just channel energies through themselves and do not have to study at all!~
@404  = ~Well, that’s what I want!~
@405  = ~They are just as consumed by the lust for power as mages.~
@406  = ~I would not have expected that from you.~
@407  = ~Balance is a noble goal... but neutrality is often achieved by sacrificing passions and personal attachments.~
@408  = ~They are the strange sort, but may be piety is what your blood demands.~
@409  = ~Hmm, may be. But I think I am more attracted to their spirituality, than to the possibility of being converted to their faith.~
@410  = ~You got it.~
@411  = ~You know everything shines about you... your eyes, your lips, your teeth, your hair... I think that in the night time one does not need a torch when you are around...~
@412  = ~Oh, that’s such a lovely thing to say, thank you Valygar.~
@413  = ~Yeah, and so does my armour.~
@414  = ~Sounds like I can apply for a job with a lighthouse...~
@415  = ~Valygar, you know, it is a bit out of place to say such things to a group leader... May I ask you not to do so again?~
@416  = ~My pleasure... You are a delight to look upon.~
@417  = ~Yes, it does... Woman, do you have any flaws?~
@418  = ~I was never good with words... I just wanted to tell you...~
@419  = ~I know what you meant to say. And you said it very well.~
@420  = ~The words are fine, Valygar, I just do not wish to hear them from you.~
@421  = ~Well, just do not try to make it as a bard, you’d soon starve...~
@422  = ~(*laughs*) You have made my day, <CHARNAME>.~
@423  = ~Oh... of course, <CHARNAME>.  I didn’t mean to bother you.~
@424  = ~No, why would I? I am not mad enough to ask people to pay money to listen to me sing.~
@425  = ~You remind me of a nightingale I heard singing last morn. It was high above the Toril, but yet not so high so that his song couldn’t reach the ground anymore... That’s how you are. You are above us mortals, but you are still among us.  Your power grows and my heart tells me that you are one of those who might walk among the gods one day. Would you fly high into the sky, given the choice?~
@426  = ~It’s meaningless to ponder about such things before the choice is offered, Valygar. I am a mortal woman for now, and as such I do not know what the future has in store for me. I care only of staying alive from dawn to dawn.~
@427  = ~I would, Valygar.~
@428  = ~Me, a goddess? No, I am not applying for a job like that. I’d die from overexertion trying to do things right. A group of five-six people I can manage, but an army of power-hungry priests, fanatical devotees and annoying avatars?  Nope, I want no part of it.~
@429  = ~I was born mortal and I will stay mortal. I wish to take all I can from life. Adventure, romance, may be family and quiet retirement one day.~
@430  = ~I understand... You are a very sensible person <CHARNAME>. I hope you will not fly too far away one day. ~
@431  = ~So you have decided already. I see. Very well, do what you need to do. But remember that from so far away you will be just a speck to those you loved and who loved you. Their voices will be lost in the constant stream of your devotee’s prayers.~
@432  = ~On second thought you may be right, Valygar. I should think more on that.~
@433  = ~And that’s the way I want it. ~
@434  = ~I hope you are serious. I can never tell it with you.~
@435  = ~Fine.  Do what you want...it’s got nothing to do with me.~
@436  = ~Really? You want all those things? But that’s wonderful! Well, I mean, it’s great that you know so well what you want.~
@437  = ~When I walk over the fallen leaves I often think that those are the past days of my life. Some are bright, some dark, some half-rotten... But it does not matter any more. The past is the past and future we know not. What we need to worry about is today. Do you agree, <CHARNAME>?~
@438  = ~Melancholy does not suit you, Valygar. But you are right: who gives a damn about the past? And what is the point to try to guess what is in store for us? Today is real. Let’s try to make it a great day.~
@439  = ~Both the past and the future are important. Today is the consequence of yesterday’s doings. Tomorrow is what we are looking forward to, when the things get rough.~
@440  = ~(*sigh*): The desires of my siblings are about to come true: I am going to die of boredom, talking to you. Is that what you want?~
@441  = ~I guess, I’ll try to be more cheerful to please you next time I speak to you. As of late I do not care much for anything in my past that was not connected to you. I do not care what is in store for tomorrow as long as I can be around you.~
@442  = ~I... I do not know what to say...~
@443  = ~Valygar, let’s not continue this conversation. Do not walk on the thin ice, for you might fall through it and drown.~
@444  = ~I feel the same way, Valygar.~
@445  = ~Say nothing then.~
@446  = ~I am not easily frightened, <CHARNAME>.~
@447  = ~You give me hope that one day there will be more to our lives than swords and spells... But... even now we need to go. ~
@448  = ~Maybe... I am nearing thirty and all that has passed cannot be washed away from my soul by soap or by ale. But as of late I do not care much for anything in my past that was not connected to you. I do not care what is in store for tomorrow as long as I can be around you.~
@449  = ~I feel the same way Valygar.~
@450  = ~I was dreaming of the ocean, <CHARNAME>. And of my mother. All I have left of her is the name of the village in northern Zakhara that she came from.  She used to promise me that one day we’d take a ship and voyage to Zakhara... It never came to be.~
@451  = ~That’s so sad. May be one day you can travel there on your own and see your people.~
@452  = ~Where is Zakhara? What was your mother’s name? How did she end up in Faerun? Why...~
@453  = ~Well, you cannot do anything about it now, can you? You mother is, ah, dead, is she not?~
@454  = ~Maybe. You know, I dream sometimes about building a ship and sailing to Zakhara.~
@455  = ~Ranger on the high seas... Valygar, do hire professional help, if you go for it, won’t you? ~
@456  = ~That sounds so romantic...~
@457  = ~Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.~
@458  = ~Are you worried about me? I would hire help to build the ship, of course... But I also thought about help of another kind... Do you think that one day, when your quest is over, you might want to come along? I will steer the ship and you will sing to the winds and waves to make our passage a pleasure.~
@459  = ~Hmm, I must tell you that I have other obligations after my quest is done... Sorry Valygar, it seems that you will have to go on your own, but I wish you the very best of luck.~
@460  = ~No, I would not. I am sure you will find someone else to sit under the white sails of your ship, Valygar.~
@461  = ~I... I would. But only if your navigational skills are better then my singing... Otherwise we’d drown before lifting the anchor.~
@462  = ~I will come with you Valygar. But I am afraid that day may be far away...~
@463  = ~We can both learn... Or if we are hopeless, we can take a merchant ship... It might not be so beautiful, but...~
@464  = ~Do finish the sentence, Valygar. ~
@465  = ~...but we would still be together.~
@466  = ~I knew you would say that. I like that idea.~
@467  = ~Well, some of our companions may join in the venture.~
@468  = ~Glad you pointed that out. On the second thought I changed my mind. I do not want to go anywhere alone with you.~
@469  = ~You are kind to say so, my lady.  Thank you.~
@470  = ~As you wish.  Let my cold silence be your companion, then.~
@471  = ~It does not matter how far away that day is. The plans are laid and I will do my best to help you through the terrible mess your heritage turned your life into. Just stay alive and I will wait as long as is required.~
@472  = ~You take care of yourself too, Valygar.~
@473  = ~(*coughs*) Do you think that one day, when your quests are over, you’d want to come along? I will steer the ship and you will sing to the winds and waves to make our passage a pleasure?~
@474  = ~Hmm, I must tell you that I have other obligations after my quests are done... Sorry Valygar, it seems that you would have to go on your own, but I wish you the very best of luck.~
@475  = ~Oh, well that’s okay, then.~
@476  = ~I did not know that my past is so interesting to you. Abyssina is my mother’s name... as I told you before. As far as I know she was a war mage on a ship which stopped in Athkatla... and that’s how she met my father... Zakhara is a large land south from Faerun and that’s where my mother came from. You know, I dream sometimes about building a ship and sailing to Zakhara...~
@477  = ~You mean I killed her? Not her, an undead monster she became... still, it’s always haunted me. I never really knew her. She was always too busy to talk to me when I was growing up. Then I stopped trying. But I dream sometimes about building a ship and sailing to Zakhara.~
@478  = ~Ranger on the high seas... Valygar, do hire professional help, if you go for it, will you? ~
@479  = ~That sounds so romantic.~
@480  = ~I look at you and at <CHARNAME> and I cannot stop wondering. You are so similar and yet so different... Both flamboyant, both capable of what few man could hope to accomplish, both so spirited...~
@481  = ~This question, my gorgeous goddess, is one I will answer only with my advocate present.~
@482  = ~Is that true? Did she blush?~
@483  = ~Then you know more of the matter than I do.~
@484  = ~(*Whistles some tune and looks thoughtful. From time to time his gaze stops at you and he sighs.*)~
@485  = ~(*He is too deep in thought to hear, or he is ignoring Mazzy*.)~
@486  = ~Valygar, I think Mazzy would like to speak to you.~
@487  = ~Mazzy, I think it had been a very long and tiring day. May be you can wait till next morning to talk to him?~
@488  = ~Mazzy, she did not say anything to deserve this outburst from you. And I have a name.~
@489  = ~Mazzy you make absolutely no sense. Valygar Corthala is my name and to that will I answer. While I appreciate the special... ahem... attention you have shown me in selecting me as your squire, I still do not fully understand why don’t you pick someone more... willing.~
@490  = ~Mazzy, I really do not want to debate this issue any longer.~
@491  = ~Mazzy, <CHARNAME> is right, the night is grown too late for talking. I would listen to what you have to say on the morn.~
@492  = ~Precisely, Lady Fentan.~
@493  = ~I am tired, just like <CHARNAME> had noticed... so gently...~
@494  = ~I do not belittle the value of your friendship, Mazzy. And I give you mine freely. But I would appreciate if you’d allow me some space.~
@495  = ~Good night, Lady Fentan.~
@496  = ~Sometimes you seem to have a great sadness about you Mazzy and you keep your own council for hours. Does anything trouble you? Are you sick?~
@497  = ~Are you sure? I know you well enough to see that something is amiss.~
@498  = ~He sounds like a halfing of exceptional valour, Mazzy.~
@499  = ~A human?~
@500  = ~No Mazzy, not strange...~
@501  = ~Mazzy, you are wrong. I see nothing strange in the fact that Patrick loved you. It’s just... I think because Patrick was a human ranger... Maybe that’s the reason you place more trust in me than in others among our group.~
@502  = ~ I did not, Mazzy. You know very well, that I am not interested in romance...~
@503  = ~Yes, Minsc, is something wrong?~
@504  = ~Um... he is? Why that is... wonderful Minsc. Let him know that I am truly honored.~
@505  = ~Minsc, is something amiss?~
@506  = ~Why... er... how does he..?~
@507  = ~I’m sorry Minsc, in this case he is mistaken - there is no special attraction between <CHARNAME> and I.~
@508  = ~Arrgh, what is that! I - ugh! Minsc what in the name of all that is holy is your damned hamster doing in my leggings? (*He holds Boo by the tail.*)~
@509  = ~I’m sorry Minsc, but you must keep your pet away from my personal belongings.~
@510  = ~Virginal???? (moans...) Why in the Nine Hells are you concerned about my... ahem... virginity?~
@511  = ~I am lost for words, Minsc. <CHARNAME> and I, we are not... Just keep your hamster out of my clothing... and... never mind, Minsc... never mind...~
@512  = ~I am in no mood to listen to your never-ending scolding Jaheira. The last woman who pointed out my faults was my mother, before I was old enough to walk out on her. I doubt you’d give up so easily... What have I done wrong this time? Let me guess: my katana is too dull? Should I buy some armor polish from the Order of the Radiant Heart?~
@513  = ~I should emphasize Jaheira that I told it to <CHARNAME> in a private conversation. Should I want your opinion, I would address my remark to you.~
@514  = ~Jaheira, <CHARNAME> is a kind of person who makes up her own mind. I assure you, that I cannot change her opinion on family or anything else. ~
@515  = ~Because I’d like her to be my friend, why else?~
@516  = ~Jaheira, I had been wrong about you and I want to apologize. I thought the criticism you bestow on everyone is a sign of a bad temper, but then I have noticed that you do it out of love you have for your friends. Take <CHARNAME>... I have seen you to treat her with almost motherly tenderness, yet it is she who gets the most of your... ahem... advice.~
@517  = ~Indeed. I guess, what I wanted to say is that you have been a very good friend of <CHARNAME> and I understand why she is so fond of you...~
@518  = ~She is exceptional... yes. I could never imagine that I would meet a person like her...~
@519  = ~I feel strange, healer... Sort of sad and restless. I wondered yesterday why the stars were placed on the sky. I am afraid my concentration would be impaired by this strange mood. Do you have a potion or something?~
@520  = ~May be it is infectious? Jaheira, are you well yourself?~
@521  = ~Jaheira... I heard that Khalid was a good man and I mourn his death. I am sorry that I have stirred your pain... I’ll pick up a potion from the pack at random and mix it up with ale... That never failed to help me before against every wound or illness...~
@522  = ~I think I’d skip the potion bit. Strong dwarven ale will do just fine on its own...  Love... bah...~
@523  = ~Anomen, I do not know why is that you think that I can help you in your lovelife... I suggest you would seek guidance from the Order of the Radiant Heart on how to handle your affection.~
@524  = ~<CHARNAME>? Oh... I see. Indeed, Anomen, I do not think you would please the Order by making advances at the child of Bhaal. I have heard that the Order is very... ahem... conservative.~
@525  = ~Anomen, if you are serious enough to propose marriage, then why in Nine Hells do you care for what the Order might say? And why it is me who was graced by the title of your confidant? I have no interest whatsoever in what is going on between you and <CHARNAME>. Leave me be!~
@526  = ~What is it, Anomen? Are you searching for another advice? Please, I am hardly fit for giving directions to women’s hearts. I had one disastrous experience after another.~
@527  = ~Listen Anomen, my first love dumped me for a local smith a week after I went to the military service.~
@528  = ~No, Anomen, I did not. I had no luck in finding a soul mate and with my family heritage it’s for the best.  I do not sing under ladies’ balconies any more.~
@529  = ~Indeed she is. Now leave me alone.~
@530  = ~I will never be able to express my gratitude to you for reversing the curse of vampirism <CHARNAME>.~
@531  = ~I know that my resurrection slowed our progress. And I feel guilty that my plight has inadvertently caused death of those we could have protected. But we all are fighting the same enemy, Anomen... I hope we are. As for <CHARNAME>’s attempt to save me... I am sure she would do that for any of us.~
@532  = ~Let’s leave it at that. No hard feelings.~
@533  = ~Indeed, <CHARNAME>. (*quietly*) I am sorry, my dear friend for stirring up his  temper.~
@534  = ~Of cause she would! You are being ridiculous Anomen.~
@535  = ~Anomen, get a grip on yourself at last... You cannot let your temper get out of hand and allow anger to run your life.~
@536  = ~Viconia, your glance bothers me.~
@537  = ~Well, I am not, Viconia.~
@538  = ~I am not interested in a lecture on drow psychology, Viconia. I do not know what is happening in your narrow dirty mind, but <CHARNAME> is thankfully not like you. She is a kind, valiant and well-meaning woman, who struggles to overcome her tragic heritage. I would be proud if <CHARNAME> took an interest in me, but she would never torment any person, let alone her friend. And that’s what we are: friends.~
@539  = ~Good riddance...~
@540  = ~Drow, I am not pleased by you standing so close to me. Move away.~
@541  = ~We are not in Menzoberranzan. And I have no desire...~
@542  = ~Think what you want.~
@543  = ~Uh-huh. (*tries to walk away*)~
@544  = ~Find yourself another toy, drow. (*shakes her off*)~
@545  = ~Yeah, yeah. I will watch out for a poisoned dart from now on.~
@546  = ~I heard you singing yesterday evening. It sounded so sad and beautiful. I thought that it was the tongue of Kara-Tur.~
@547  = ~I know. But it does not happen often to me. What the song was about?~
@548  = ~Love... You seem almost too young for love. I am too old for it, and still a song about love captures our hearts.~
@549  = ~Very close, dear Kachiko. I am slightly younger. But that’s if you count age in years. My heart is older, for I told myself once that I should not love again.~
@550  = ~My family carries a curse, Kachiko. The Corthalas themselves, and almost everyone mad enough to become involved with Corthalas, end up wasting their lives in pursuit of forbidden magical knowledge. I cannot imagine bringing such a grief to a person dear to me. Thus I shall not get involved.~
@551  = ~Not if it becomes a dark obsession, the only passion a person knows. It is scary, Kachiko.~
@552  = ~The grim reality of our lives does not touch you, Kachiko. There is always a smile on your face and your words are friendly to anyone. What is the secret?~
@553  = ~I envy you.~
@554  = ~Because killing and loving are two different things.~
@555  = ~No. I feel like a man who wishes to jump off the cliff to enjoy a moment of flight and does not care that he will die as a result.~
@556  = ~I realize that Kachiko’s heart is beyond reach, Yoshimo. I shall go then, Kachiko. Seems that Yoshimo have to speak to you in private.~
@557  = ~What is it this time, Anomen?~
@558  = ~Trying what?~
@559  = ~It would help greatly if you elaborate. I am trying many things. One of them not to start laughing. I thought you were a wordy sort before.~
@560  = ~You want me to cast a healing spell on you, priest of Helm?~
@561  = ~As you say.~
@562  = ~Watch me.~
@563  = ~Anomen?~
@564  = ~<CHARNAME> is not yours, neither is she mine. She is a person in her own right and she chooses whom to spend her time with.~
@565  = ~Been eavesdropping lately, Anomen?~
@566  = ~Be careful with your words, Anomen. You have no reason to speak of treachery.  You never loved her...~
@567  = ~I dare. When you love someone, you wish her to be happy. Even if she is far away and out of reach...~
@568  = ~Grow up, Anomen. This conversation is over.~
@569  = ~Leave her alone! Just you try to tell her any of this nonsense...~
@570  = ~Yes.~
@571  = ~Viconia?~
@572  = ~Viconia, I pretty much got the impression that you hate my guts. This feeling is mutual.~
@573  = ~Everything. By the Nine Hells, I do not believe I participate in a conversation like this! It’s insane. You hate me, I hate you. Our feelings prevent us from becoming lovers. At least among surfacers they do.~
@574  = ~Yes, Viconia. Logical. Simple.~
@575  = ~Because... well... because...~
@576  = ~No!~
@577  = ~Not to my knowledge, unless she hears this conversation.~
@578  = ~So what, Viconia? The world does not consist of love and hate, drow. There are many shades in between... There is friendship, respect... other things you have no idea about.~
@579  = ~No, Viconia, that’s not going to happen.~
@580  = ~Oh, no, not again! Was I not clear enough the last ten times? Viconia, I am not interested in anything you have to offer.~
@581  = ~I doubt that.~
@582  = ~Uh-huh.~
@583  = ~I think I am getting a headache, Viconia. Now if you’d kindly shut up.~
@584  = ~Somehow I knew it would come to that. Are you trying to encourage me to be with another woman? Why? What is in it for you?~
@585  = ~Get away from me, you evil witch!~
@586  = ~Whatever...~
@587  = ~I have little patience for your ramblings! Leave me be.~
@588  = ~What scar are you referring to, Jan?~
@589  = ~This is mud! We’re all covered in the stuff, even you gnome.~
@590  = ~(*rolls his eyes and stay silent*)~
@591  = ~No, gnome, you are not going to feed me yet another tale about a trice removed cousin of your brother-in-law from you grandmother’s side. I will not listen to more tall tales about turnip pies!~
@592  = ~Oh, no...~
@593  = ~How ingenious!~
@594  = ~My heart bleeds for you...~
@595  = ~That is a huge relief. I must go now.~
@596  = ~Jan, I must tell you that I admire your loyalty to Lissa. Your actions were worthy of the noblest paladins.~
@597  = ~I know Jan. I was sickened at the bastard who dared to curse his own child! I wish we could remove him from Lissa’s life. It is obvious he is cruel to her.~
@598  = ~Women make curious choices sometimes.~
@599  = ~Oh... Jan, I am sure it is a wonderful story, but I have to go...~
@600  = ~You know Jan; sometimes wish I were shorter. Maybe then you would take less notice of me.~
@601  = ~Very enterprising. A woman with the true spirit of the Jansens.~
@602  = ~Alas indeed... Sorry, Jan, gotta run.~
@603  = ~What is it Aerie? Men far stronger than I could not stay silent at the behest of those puppy eyes. Do you need any help? Do you need to talk?~
@604  = ~Why are you so sad?~
@605  = ~Well yes, I suppose so. I miss the carefree hunting trips I’d spend with my father and there were times when my mother could be gentle...~
@606  = ~No matter Aerie. Like you, I fear my pain is never far away.~
@607  = ~Careful! Aerie! Keep an eye on where you step. I swear it is more difficult to keep you from stumbling than to make a red dragon to share his treasures. Oh, your eyes are watering again, what is it?~
@608  = ~Now, why is that? We are all friends here.~
@609  = ~Do you want to return to the circus? Why won’t you talk with <CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME> would understand if you left the group to return back, I am sure...~
@610  = ~I see. Helping people in need and protecting them is something rangers do, Aerie. I will help a stranded traveller or a peaceful merchant besieged by bandits.  I care for everyone who belongs to this group, including you. But I gather from your tone that you seek something more than a mere bodyguard.~
@611  = ~<NO TEXT>~
@612  = ~Yoshimo, I am trying to read. Reading is something one practices in solitude.~
@613  = ~I’m sorry Yoshimo; I am not in the mood for tale telling.~
@614  = ~Do what you may.~
@615  = ~What is it?~
@616  = ~There are indeed, but none that I would care to share with companions around a campfire.~
@617  = ~Perhaps not, but the tales my mother told me still cause me to awake in terror on occasion. Do not ask me to repeat them.~
@618  = ~Indeed. Good night.~
@619  = ~Sir Firecam, you wish to speak to me?~
@620  = ~Keldorn, I believe that I knew my parents well enough to understand what happened between them.~
@621  = ~What are you implying, Keldorn?~
@622  = ~Whispers! You want me to believe your recollection of rumors, rather than what I saw with my own eyes year after year?~
@623  = ~It is too late for forgiving, Keldorn. They both are dead.~
@624  = ~Keldorn, these rumors you mentioned, the rumors about my parents...~
@625  = ~Yes, I wish to know. I hope... I hope that it won’t be just another story about a crazed Corthala, burning villages to the ground attempting to cast prohibited spells. You look surprised? I have heard plenty of those tales! I hear them everywhere I go in Amn.~
@626  = ~I should have guessed. Oh, well, go ahead.~
@627  = ~Plenty to make all of Athkatla dance with joy and extend a jubilant welcome...~
@628  = ~My father...~
@629  = ~That’s definitely a very different Corthala story. Thank you, Keldorn.~
@630  = ~The Corthala name will die with me, Keldorn. I decided on that long ago and I will not change my mind.~
@631  = ~I hope that she will understand my reasons.~
@632  = ~How valuable is your advice on family values Keldorn? Your children forgot you and your wife sought comfort in the arms of another.~
@633  = ~I am sorry, Keldorn, I should not have snapped at you. I do not like to be lectured.~
@634  = ~And so we met with your infamous aunt, Lady Delcia.~
@635  = ~Do you mean Athkatla’s Slums?~
@636  = ~She might have forgotten Slums, Nalia. But the Slums remember her.~
@637  = ~Twenty years ago or so, Lady Delcia was a young spirited girl, keen on helping those less fortunate. Much to the distress of her family she spent more of her time among commoners than in the keep.~
@638  = ~It happened that one day a pack of vampiric wolves settled in the forest surrounding the Keep terrorizing the villagers. Lady Delcia bade a man, rumored to be a slave gladiator from Slums to help De’Arnise. She bought his freedom. Your Grandfather promised the man Lady Delcia’s hand if he would kill the wolves.~
@639  = ~No, he laughed at the Duke’s offer and said that a barrel of ale from De’Arnise’s cellars would do. After he killed the wolves he got his ale and run off. Since then Lady Delcia adopted an avid hatred of lowlife people...~
@640  = ~That’s what I have heard, Nalia. But people in the Slums are not the most reliable source.~
@641  = ~Nalia, why do you keep complaining that we are not helping the poor? We are not on a charitable mission, we are helping <CHARNAME> to regain her soul.~
@642  = ~Do it, Nalia. I am sure <CHARNAME> would not mind. <CHARNAME>?~
@643  = ~Nalia, we are sort of short on cash right now. I promise you, that as soon as we will have some money I will make a donation. ~
@644  = ~Here, Nalia, take these 500 gold pieces and give them to the temple. It is a small contribution, but it may give a starving child a supper or a desperate man a shelter.~
@645  = ~Nalia, we are doing enough by clearing the place from monsters of all sorts to help people. So quit whining. And I am very disappointed in you, Valygar.~
@646  = ~Worry not, Nalia, once we have some money to spare, <CHARNAME> will donate some to a temple. For now, we are killing enough monsters to help people out.~
@647  = ~That was very generous of you, my friend.~
@648  = ~There is a measure of truth in your words.~
@649  = ~I told you not to bother <CHARNAME> with your foolishness, Anomen.~
@650  = ~Like the Nine Hells it is! I will not leave you alone with her.~
@651  = ~(*sighs*) I am not jealous. I am worried that in your current state you are capable of hurting her.~
@652  = ~(*laughs*) Of course milady. I erred. I shall not bother you and your lover any longer.~
@653  = ~As Lady commands.~
@654  = ~You heard what she said. It was quite clear.~
@655  = ~Anomen...~
@656  = ~Anomen... (*Anomen turns slowly away... tears drop onto his polished armour suit*)~
@657  = ~Anomen, stop crying... you are knight after all...~
@658  = ~Anomen, shame on you... you are knight after all...~
@659  = ~Well, I am afraid you will not have your answer.~
@660  = ~You are not going after <CHARNAME>, you are not yourself. Anomen!~
@661  = ~I am afraid you will have to choose sooner or later.~
@662  = ~I do not deny faith. But I do not have love for gods and I do not worship them.~
@663  = ~A shaky support and a false hope.~
@664  = ~If I choose to worship, I’ll worship Shaundakul if that’s what you want to know.~
@665  = ~I do not like looking at woman above the leaping fire, Sime. It brings ill memories.~
@666  = ~You will be disappointed. It was only a childhood nightmare.~
@667  = ~(*shrugs*)~
@668  = ~You will have the tale, or I will not have rest?~
@669  = ~Very well. I was a boy of eight years and I played around Corthala’s mansion. By chance I went through a secret entrance...~
@670  = ~Accidentally. It lead to a room my mother used for summoning. I saw her, standing against flames, crying out the words of the spell in agony... Then the demon appeared in the flames. It growled and pointed at me, mocking my fear, asking mother if I was to be killed. Mother managed to control the demon, but her anger was so terrible, that I thought I’d prefer to be eaten by the demon...~
@671  = ~I know now. I did not know then. You heard the tale, now you think you will go sleep and leave me alone?~
@672  = ~Then there was an actress, who thought that a liaison with an infamous cursed Corthala can be quite dramatic. Not to mention that she firmly believed that I was rich, and she nearly fainted when I told her the truth of Corthala’s wealth.~
@673  = ~Lastly, the beautiful Suna. Suna Seni, who wished to become a ranger-protector so much. Who was looking at me with her charming eyes and asking: "Valygar, how long should I aim? Valygar, how can you track a beast if it run across the stream and I lost its footprints?" And my heart melted.~
@674  = ~Too bad that dear Suna was a thrill-seeker and had little idea on the difference between a bandit and a ranger. Last time I have seen her she was hanging out with the bandits hunting people down and selling them into slavery.~
