@0    = ~The surface... what a stupid place! Here, in Amn, you are a strong and valiant warrior. In your homeland you'd be subservient to some lowly jaluk. Stupid place.~
@1    = ~Do not think me a fool. In Kara-Tur women are slaves of men... The ones who sell themselves are considered to be "free"! ~
@2    = ~What about you, Kachiko? Are you trying to find a lover to gain power?~
@3    = ~I do not understand you. If the only place to find power is some jaluk's bed that's where I would be...~
@4    = ~I care not for your displeasure. When female desires to watch a male he should be grateful of attention and shiver with delight and anticipation of an order.~
@5    = ~That's because you are a fool, rivvin. I can see now why <CHARNAME> would take an interest in you. Such a pleasure is torturing a bold male...~
@6    = ~You are sad and pathetic, male. You see not the obvious. You refute what could be your greatest chance to change your lowly station. I shall not spare you any more of my time, rivvin.~
@7    = ~Oh, the male is rude. Were we in Menzoberranzan, I'd beat you to death for a tenth of this insult. But you would not dare even look at me, let alone speak to me there. You would crawl by my feet and beg for my attention.~
@8    = ~Do you even know what desire is? The longer I watch you, the firmer is my conviction that you are no man's friend and no woman's lover. Fury and emptiness you are.~
@9    = ~I am bored and I will accept an inadequate substitute, such as an ungraceful human.~
@10   = ~Valygar? (*catches his sleeve*)~
@11   = ~You will regret this! I hate you!~
@12   = ~Silence, male. I have decided that you will deliver me some pleasure tonight. That's of course if your clumsiness is bearable...~
@13   = ~What that has to do with my order?~
@14   = ~So if mutual hate forbids surfacers to become lovers, mutual love shall promote it?~
@15   = ~Then why are you not laying by <CHARNAME>'s side?~
@16   = ~Do you hate her?~
@17   = ~Does she hate you?~
@18   = ~So?~
@19   = ~You are a hypocrite and a liar, male. I may not know much of the surfacers but I know desire when I see it. Now, leave this pointless argument and do what I ordered you.~
@20   = ~Shut up, rivvin! I am going to tell you something you want to hear.~
@21   = ~You say your blood is cursed by a hereditary affliction to dark magic. <CHARNAME> says that her dark ancestry taints her blood.~
@22   = ~Blood against blood, taint against taint. Which should win? Do you think Corthala's blood is stronger than Bhaal's? Do not you think that your precious magical curse will be burnt out of the veins of a child should it mix with a god's blood?~
@23   = ~No, no. You are not afraid of the curse. You are simply an impotent, miserable, scared male who is incapable of touching a woman.~
@24   = ~There is a sweet torture to see a winner and her prize burn. I had a husband once and I caught him with my sister. I burnt them. I still can see the flames licking their corpses. Shaar was smiling that day on me.~
@25   = ~(*laughs*) The one you cherish is no better than I. Think about what I have said about the taint, ranger.~
@26   = ~Why you are going away from the Shadow Thieves Guild? You do not look stupid to me, and yet your actions are inapt. In your absence another would usurp your rightful place by your father.~
@27   = ~You find it more desirable to crawl through the dirty streets and be treated like rubbish by every rivvin you meet and still have no station?~
@28   = ~(*snorts*) And they will get it, no doubt. Typical. Imbecilic surfacers.~
@29   = ~Very few. Lloth is a cunning Mistress and watches her herd carefully. The high priestesses are ever restless, hunting the outlaws to sacrifice to Lloth and gain her favor.~
@30   = ~I know of none. Drizzt * spits * brought misfortune and ill fate to all of the Menzoberranzan. I doubt that anyone would feel anything but loathing for him and his choices. Drizzt's treachery strengthened my people's resolve to keep to their own ways.~
@31   = ~If you wish for me to answer to all of my kin's doings, you are too late. You should have thrown a torch into my pyre.~
@32   = ~(*Hisses and tries to stab Sime*)~
@33   = ~What is going on? I did not think you were such close friends to stay up late and chat.~
@34   = ~Can I ever get any sleep around here? Viconia, Sime, break it!~
@35   = ~What in Nine Hells is going on?~
@36   = ~Shut up mrannd d'ssins. Rivvin.~
@37   = ~Viconia, that's it. I have given you shelter against fanatics and how do you repay me? By trying to kill the woman I love?~
@38   = ~Viconia, get you backpack and go away. Now!~
@39   = ~Jal ssinrig zhah waella - All love is foolish.~
@40   = ~No it is not. You are wrong, have not I taught you anything? (*sighs*) Oh, Viconia. I guess it is my own fault, I should not have spend so much time with another and give your poor lost heart so much troubles. Sime, I am sorry about what have happened. I am sure you have it in you to forgive both Viconia and myself. I should not have abandoned the road I walked with Viconia.~
@41   = ~Whatever you say, Viconia. But do not you dare to as much as look at Sime unfriendly again! I am sorry that you have suffered from that vile woman, Sime. Be strong, my love.~
@42   = ~I was going to. (*laughs*)  But I wanted to kill your blonde first. Ssun usst - fear me! ~
