@0    = ~You were pretty insistent on killing Yoshimo. Now you two act like the closest of friends. I find it suspicious.~
@1    = ~No. My first impression never failed me. But tell me child, is it a blush I see on your cheeks when you speak of Yoshimo?~
@2    = ~Well, you may be hot, you may be ill or you may be in love. I assume the latter, since the weather is mild and you are a strong and healthy person.~
@3    = ~Oh, then it is true...~
@4    = ~And we were not arguing.~
@5    = ~Your katana is in satisfactory condition. Your soul truly is dull and requires polishing. I have heard you say to <CHARNAME> that you would not wed and have children. I find a claim like that...~
@6    = ~Fool man. Talking of a thing like that with a girl, who never knew her mother and whose stepfather was killed at her very eyes! She have never known a joy of growing in a proper family, she had never been told of love her parents shared and that led to her birth... You do not solve your problems by complaining to her and you traumatize her with your unhealthy views on family building.~
@7    = ~I think you can. I suggest that you choose another, happier things to discuss with her, than your life story. By the way, you are getting to know <CHARNAME> very well, Valygar. I'd say you are actively seeking her friendship. I wonder why?~
@8    = ~I speak my mind freely and I care of my friends. If someone is unhappy with that... well that's their problem, not mine.~
@9    = ~I had been entrusted with the care of <CHARNAME> long ago by Gorion Spellwielder, a man whom I respected deeply. I would never back away from my promise to him. <CHARNAME>'s own qualities are exceptional, but as any child she requires guidance. And that I am willing to give her.~
@10   = ~O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms
Alone and palely loitering?~
@11   = ~Yes, I am fine, thank you. Your question had reminded me what my husband Khalid told me when we first met. He said that he just found and lost the world. Then he read me these lines and asked if the faery daughter has a healing for his heart... Oh, Khalid...~
@12   = ~It will not help you this time, Valygar. I know precisely what your sickness is, but I am not the one who can heal it. You are in love, Valygar. Shall I give you the name as well, or you know it yourself?~
@13   = ~Drop my guard? With the likes of you in the group? I am not mad enough.~
@14   = ~I am not easily offended. But I have seen your type oft enough to be weary, Sime Linvail. I have heard you talking to men. Your words are honey, but your heart is cold.  You called yourself a hunter, as I recall. Indeed you are. But the heads of men are your trophies.~
@15   = ~You may think so, Sime, but around women like you there is always some turmoil. You seek drama and thrill, and you break hearts without looking back.~
@16   = ~And what would you know of potions?~
@17   = ~More talents. Aren't we fortunate to have someone so learned and well-traveled amongst us! But Sime, Tethyr is far away from Icewind Dale and we have found an acceptable substitute.~
@18   = ~Jealous? No, I am not. Why would I? I am only pitying <CHARNAME>. The empty-headed toy like you would not give anything. You are not capable to give and instill the true deep feelings, warm and tender, of the sort my Khalid and I shared.~
@19   = ~Child, are you going just to sit there and listen your mouth agape, to some foolish girl to shame your oldest friend?~
@20   = ~I? A loyal companion? So that's how you feel about me? I shall remember.~
@21   = ~Oh, now I hear a man grown, not a boy!~
@22   = ~I think that I shall use it then.~
