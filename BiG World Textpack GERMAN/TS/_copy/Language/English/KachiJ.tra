@0    = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I cannot stay with you any longer. Without Yoshimo, I have nothing to do in your party. I must go back to Kozakura. Good luck to you.~
@1    = ~<CHARNAME>, you promised that you would lead me to Yoshimo! Yet all we are doing is running around in small circles all day!~
@2    = ~Oh, and I was wondering what was it that we forgot to do? Kachiko, we are going right away!~
@3    = ~Girl, what do you need Yoshimo for anyway? Can’t you skip your vendetta or something?~
@4    = ~You better act upon your word, <CHARNAME>!~
@5    = ~No, I cannot. You lied to me. You have no intention to lead me to Yoshimo! I do not need your help! I’ll find Yoshimo eventually! I SWEAR I’ll find him! There has to be somewhere I haven’t looked!~
@6    = ~You lied to me. You have no intention to lead me to Yoshimo! I do not need your help! I’ll find Yoshimo eventually! I SWEAR I’ll find him! There has to be somewhere I haven’t looked!~
@7    = ~Ah, here you are, bastard! You thought you could flee far enough? I promised to find you even in Nine Hells! Prepare to die!~
@8    = ~Yoshimo, you sound sincere... Hmm... If what you say is true, we must come back to Kara-Tur and try to convince my family that you’re not the murderer. But if you lied... <CHARNAME>, we have to leave for Kara-Tur immediately.~
@9    = ~Kachiko, are you going back on your promise to help me?~
@10   = ~Of course, Kachiko, I understand. Farewell.~
@11   = ~<CHARNAME>, do you need another companion in your group? May be you let Yoshimo to tag along? Then I can keep an eye on him and we both will help you out...~
@12   = ~You will not get away that easily! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I have to go after him!~
@13   = ~Don’t lie to me. You won’t escape again. I’ll watch you even if I have to break my word to <CHARNAME>.~
@14   = ~Of course, I need all help I can get. Welcome back, Yoshimo.~
@15   = ~I don’t need your help. Go away, both of you.~
@16   = ~I don’t know you, I don’t need your problems and I grow tired of this soap opera. Perhaps killing both of you will brighten things up!~
@17   = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@18   = ~Yoshimo, wait. I am leaving with you. Alone you will only get into more troubles. Sorry <CHARNAME>, but I told you from the very start that I would follow whenever he goes... and I shall do so now.~ [KACHIL26]
@19   = ~Yoshimo, I am staying with you. Alone you will only get into more troubles. Sorry <CHARNAME>, but I told you from the very start that I wouldn't allow him to escape... and I shan't do so now.~
@20   = ~Yoshimo, does not this... man looks a bit familiar to you? It is strange but he reminds me Otako Hashimoto.~ [KACHIQ03]
@21   = ~My guess is that the spell might have worked and we are somehow moving towards solving our family feud. But why are we on an island, and not at home?~
@22   = ~The spell... Harpel must have done something that works for once. Let’s go on, and we will have better chance to find some answers. Yoshimo, I am mourn your loss.~
@23   = ~There are more bodies out there. Do you see them? I cannot look, I am afraid to find my kin among them.~
@24   = ~Yoshimo, I appreciate what you have said. Even if you said it because you were afraid that I’d kill you both if you ever tried anything funny.~ [KACHIQ04]
@25   = ~I am surprised by your welcome, my cousin, after all those lies you told my parents to prevent me from going after Yoshimo.~ [KACHIQ05]
@26   = ~Hold Masaki, you are too hasty. Yoshimo is no murderer and we were going home so the proof of his innocence may be found. But now I meet you on this desolate Island, talking to me as if we are at home...~
@27   = ~I mourn Naoko. Yet your words scare me. What is this place? How did Hashimoto and Nakanishi come to be here? Answer me!~
@28   = ~Yoshimo is innocent and I will fight you if I must to protect justice, which you so eagerly discard! You are disgrace to Nakanishi’s honor!~ [KACHIQ06]
@29   = ~Does Masaki Hayashi speak for Nakanishi family now?~
@30   = ~I doubt that you find it in your black heart to tell my mother that Kachiko is praying to see her and plead her case...~
@31   = ~I go where I please. I refuse to see people as enemies because they are named Hashimoto.~ [KACHIQ07]
@32   = ~I am no assassin! And no one sent me!~ [KACHIQ08]
@33   = ~I am Nakanishi. Will you kill me as well?~
@34   = ~Do you know of any other way, Aino? I have no desire to kill scores of innocent people.~
@35   = ~No, Kachiko, you are right. I say we kill this scheming bastard instead, take the wardstone and get outta here.~
@36   = ~Sorry, Kachiko, I see no other choice. I really need this wardstone!~
@37   = ~Neither would I. Yoshimo, I love you, and if we are destined to die, then we will die together!~
@38   = ~<CHARNAME>, you have been silent, but I think we should talk about what happened. Yoshimo had dishonorable intentions and it is your right to demand his death.~ [KACHIL06]
@39   = ~What do you mean Kachiko? That sounds a bit extreme.~
@40   = ~Kachiko, my custom is more forgiving than the code of a samurai. I have seen Yoshimo stand against Irenicus and refuse to surrender me. I trust him. ~
@41   = ~Glad you reminded me of the traitor. I do not wish him in my party. He may do what he wants with his life, but he may not stay.~
@42   = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, Yoshimo pledged his service to you, yet he was serving Irenicus at the same time. His intention was to deceive you. Yoshimo is not a samurai and he does not follow a strict code of honor, but his upbringing was that of a noble. His actions towards you call for ritual suicide.~
@43   = ~I respect your customs, but he has a noble heart, and he’s faithful ally. He stood against Irenicus and refused to surrender me. I trust him.~
@44   = ~Uh, well... He may do what he wants with his life, but he may not stay.~
@45   = ~So you do not see his actions as betrayal, then <CHARNAME>?~
@46   = ~No Kachiko, the way I see it, Yoshimo was loyal to me in deed if not always in his thoughts. I am quite comfortable with him staying in the party.~
@47   = ~You have a different way of thinking <CHARNAME>, but I am... I am glad you do. Yoshimo and I will prove our loyalty to you in battle. ~ [KACHIL16]
@48   = ~Avenging the suffering of my family is a part of my life, <CHARNAME>. My blade is thirsty for his blood. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor! No more talk! I am going!~
@49   = ~Try to stop me! You would have to tie me up to prevent me from fighting Irenicus. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor!~
@50   = ~I have seen it, yes. I am not afraid to die if I know that Irenicus goes down with me. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor!~
@51   = ~Are we dead? I only wished I could tell Yoshimo a proper farewell.~
