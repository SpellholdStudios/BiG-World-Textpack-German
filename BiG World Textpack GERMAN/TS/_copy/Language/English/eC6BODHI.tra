@2    = ~And you have delivered on that promise. Return Valygar and perhaps I will be merciful.~

@9    = ~What is the meaning of this performance, slave? You cannot disobey me. Go, attack the Bhaal child! Pain you feel now is going to increase slowly and infinitely if you keep neglecting my order.~

@12   = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

Bodhi has turned Sime into a vampire!  Or... or very nearly.  The process may not have been completed in the short time Bodhi has had her.  Hopefully something can be done or I will have lost her.  Perhaps the elven war sage might know some way of restoration... or Elhan... ~
@13   = ~Love... I should have sealed my doors tighter against that perpetrator. I have no times for follies, stupid bitch. Punishment you want - then you should get it. Die.~
