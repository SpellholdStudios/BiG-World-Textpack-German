@0    = ~Wait a minute! The ship is ours to take anywhere, right? <CHARNAME>, can we go to Kara-Tur now?~
@1    = ~Saemon, I have little knowledge of the sea travel. Can you tell me how long will it take us to get to Kara-Tur by sea?~
@2    = ~Or we will see Kara-Turian shores and prove that Yoshimo is innocent and restore peace between our families. I agree with you, <CHARNAME>, let the fate decide! Cast the spell captain Havarian!~
@3    = ~Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. Farewell.~
