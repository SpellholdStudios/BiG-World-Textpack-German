@0    = ~Ahhh... perhaps this is a good time to tell you of something, <CHARNAME>, seeing as you are leading us into the Docks and everything.~
@1    = ~Hmmmm. If we are going to pay the Bloodscalp a visit, <CHARNAME>, perhaps we should not wait so long. Perhaps, soon, we might pay the guildmaster a visit, yes?~
@2    = ~You do not intend to see Renal Bloodscalp anytime soon, do you?  Ahhh, no matter. If you change your mind, however, I have little doubt the man would still wish to see us.~
@3    = ~This is Shadow Thief territory... They will shoot you on the first sight for what you have done to them.~
@4    = ~Hmmmm. I would suggest we stay away from the Docks district. We are now the perfect target of all the Shadow Thieves and their supporters around.~
