@7    = ~Hütet Eure Zunge, wenn Ihr mit mir sprecht, es sei denn, Ihr wollt meine Stiefel lecken!~ [BEDWIN33]

@12   = ~Oh, my dark ravens, let us stop our squawking.  I shall remove this foul demeanor like a mask because, if you will still have me, I think I would quite enjoy the company of your troupe.~
@13   = ~Perhaps another time, Haer'Dalis.  Your world seems rather strange to me... I'll have to think it over.~
@14   = ~So hopeful that we shall meet again before too many days have passed.  But enough talk -- it is time this raven flies.~
@15   = ~Your reward will be great and the fates, my blackbird of chaos, shall smile. But enough of artful prophecy: I must fly to my troupe for no doubt they have missed my presence.~
@16   = ~It's a shame your sword arm is attached to your tongue... I'd take one but not the other.~
@17   = ~You have your logic and I have mine, my hounds of rescue: and they are not so different.  So... may I join you, then?~
@18   = ~I want no part of your word games. Leave me here to sort out my senses.~
@19   = ~I believe it to be in an altar, here... if we retrieve it, she will reward us greatly for its return.  Come, let us search this place before Mekrath's return.~
@20   = ~If you could only deliver it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe, my mistress will reward you greatly for your efforts. So with apologies, my ravens of rhetoric, I must make my exit.~
@21   = ~If you can bring it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe, perhaps all can be forgotten... The reward is yours to ponder.~
@22   = ~Aye, for you I do not doubt that life is easy... but it is easy by your ignorance, not your power... So, ant: take me now or leave me here, it's all the same to me.~
@23   = ~Alright, Haer'Dalis. Join me in whichever fashion you see fit but, slave or free, we travel together nonetheless.~
@24   = ~The fool Mekrath stole from me a most important gem... and if memory serves, it is in an altar, here.  My mistress and I shall be far more pleasant if you bore it to us in your hands.~
@25   = ~Your experiences are far from ordinary, Haer'Dalis, and I admit I am intrigued... Perhaps you hold more value to me as a comrade than as a slave. My apologies for my previous demeanor.~
@26   = ~A well-rehearsed lie sung by an actor.  Come, slave... I've no patience for all this foolishness.~
@27   = ~So... we meet in brighter times and better places, I see. Have you brought the gem?~ [HAERDA96]
@28   = ~She grants the rescue Haer'Dalis quest.~
@29   = ~Foolish gtrank small-fist! Why feltthgrr help this place? You paid too? No, Stronger get rid of guards with much gold. You just grrrth stupid then! You die!~
@30   = ~You serve Stronger? Who is that? Who directs your actions? Speak! I demand it!~
@31   = ~Ah, Mekrath's prize! It shall be our salvation yet. Here be 1,200 gold. Haer'Dalis, tell them what we are about while I prepare the summoning of the conduit.~
@32   = ~Primes and planar jewels and -- and... What do you speak of, Haer'Dalis, for you have lost me.~
@33   = ~Why did you lie to me, Haer'Dalis?~
@34   = ~Ah, the unfathomable connection between theater and interplanar travel... I'm sorry, but you have lost me entirely.~
@35   = ~What play, Haer'Dalis, and how?~
@36   = ~I'm not interested in fighting extra-planar creatures... I'll be on my way, thank you.~
@37   = ~You are more than kind. Haer'Dalis' blades are something to behold. Would you have him join you for this fight?~
@38   = ~Neither did we... he wore a mask and met with us in the alleyways. It doesn't matter... Come, my bards. It appears 'tis time to make our reckoning. Haer' Dalis?~
@39   = ~The long bow is similar to the short bow, except that the staff is about as high as the archer is, usually 6 to 6.5 feet.  Even though the longbow is slightly slower then the short bow, it has more range and is more accurate.  The smooth staff of this bow is warm to the touch, just a hint of the energy that surges through the wood.

@44   = ~If that is what you wish. It will be safer than waiting here. I will wait outside by the palisade.~ [NALIA95]
@45   = ~Short bows were the first bows to be developed, although they were not called such.  This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a long bow.  Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on the average.  This short bow is the rival of any of the larger bows.  The magic inherent within it, whether from the wood or the spellcasting of a mage, makes this bow more accurate and damaging than a normal bow.

@51   = ~Aye, for a thousand I'll do your deed. Come, Haer'Dalis, let us find ourselves a gem.~
@52   = ~Neither for a thousand nor a hundred thousand shall I be your gnomish errand-beast. Come, Haer'Dalis, your friends are wearing on my patience.~

@56   = ~Water flows down in a rush from some unknown source. There is an odd play of shadows deep within the pool.~
@57   = ~I do not want to die... please have mercy!~
@58   = ~No! NO!~
@59   = ~I have stated my wishes, not get lost!~
@60   = ~Very well. He said roughly thirty trolls and snake creatures, and that Lord de'Arnise was alive.~
@61   = ~He is alive? Wonderful! Lord de'Arnise is my father, and much preferable to Aunty. Quickly, we must rout these creatures while father is still there to save!~
@62   = ~I fear he said very little. Daleson is... dead. A tragic, tragic casualty.~
@63   = ~The trolls, they killed him. There was nothing I could do to stop them. It was most unfortunate.~
@64   = ~He was... a traitor. Yeah, that's it. He conspired... with the trolls and caused all this carnage. Yeah.~
@65   = ~It was... dreadful. He was a traitor. He did say Lord de'Arnise was alive, but can we trust his word? He was but a poor peasant, Pity him.~
@66   = ~You... are worse than any noble! He was not worthless! He was pitiable, but he had every right to exist! Get out! I will not have you in my home! Get out!~
@67   = ~I see. I suppose... he could not refuse. I... pity his weakness. There... is much left to do. You must still find my father. He will have defended this place to the last.~
@68   = ~I'm sorry to hear that, Korgan, but as pained as the past may be, try to be civil while we are traveling in human civilization.  They didn't make your past.~
@69   = ~I killed him, plain and simple.~
@70   = ~He was... a traitor. Yeah, he had conspired with... the trolls. He did say Lord de'Arnise was still alive, but maybe he was lying. Yeah.~
@71   = ~He conspired to help the trolls. He did say Lord de'Arnise was still alive, but I don't know if I trust his word. He was but a poor peasant. Pity him.~
@72   = ~Trolls are large, so bigger rooms may be full. Be careful. Strange... trolls are destructive, but much has been left intact. Maybe I'm wrong. I've been wrong before.~
@73   = ~I... I don't know what to say. I think you are lying. You do not have the presence to lie well. Get away from me. I will die on my own rather than have you in my home.~
@74   = ~I will honor him, I swear! Help me avenge him and rescue my father, Lord de'Arnise. He will give you the reward you deserve for your actions.~
@75   = ~Yes, civilization is... is still a bit frightening, though.~ [AERIE61]
@76   = ~Aerie, dear, I see that you begin to become more confident in this world... which is undoubtedly quite strange to you.  You are learning what it's like to live and thrive here.~ [MAZZY51]
@77   = ~Seek those who value honor.  Observe before you accept, especially in times of adversity.  Watch companions in conflict, and you will see them as they truly are.~
@78   = ~There is no shame in admitting your fears.  It is the only way that you might face them.~
@79   = ~To the contrary, it is a serious wound indeed.  We must attend to it immediately.~
@80   = ~Are you interested in purchasing a bit o' merchandise, my friend?~ [JANJAN01]
@81   = ~Well, you've got the look of an adventurer about you. I've been one myself, betwixt stints as a turnip salesman that is. Occasionally the markets get down and the formerly self-respecting purveyors of fine veggies are forced to prostitute their abilities in the form of adventuring.~
@82   = ~What I'm getting at, o-so-friendly one, is that I've items to sell you that are especially created, by yours truly, to aid one on the dangerous path to heroism. They're known as Jan Jansen's (that's me) Flasher Master Bruiser Mate.~
@83   = ~Argh, not again. That bottom-feeding, turnip-hating, scum-sucking brigand! Nothing better to do than stop an honest businessman from selling high quality illegal Flashers for a reasonable price. Here he comes, cover for me.~
@84   = ~Not at present.~
@85   = ~Arm wrestling ogres?~
@86   = ~Curses! The gnome has gotten to you, too!  Jansen, you can no longer peddle in Athkatla.  As for you, <CHARNAME>, you have made a dangerous enemy.~
@87   = ~If you believe that he should be free you are welcome to come down to the guardhouse and pay his fine.~
@88   = ~You have brought this doom upon yourselves, lawbreakers.~
@89   = ~A fast mouth, a handy shot with a crossbow and all this illegal machinery that I invented.~
@90   = ~There's no call for insults, you tactless orc-lover. Obviously, it is better that I not join your party.~
@91   = ~Your loss. If you change your mind I live in the less-than-opulent side of town, the slums if you will. I'll probably have a turnip stand, slowly working my way up to a nice bribe. Good luck to you.~
@92   = ~You shall not regret it.~
@93   = ~You associate with this... stable boy? What can he offer a woman of your standing?~
@94   = ~Go to the stables often, do you? I take it you prefer the company of... common men?~
@95   = ~Mind your tongue, lout! That's a lady you are talking to!~
@96   = ~It's alright, Daleson. It is nothing I have not heard from Aunty already.~
@97   = ~At last! That gnome is the worst prisoner I ever had!  He keeps picking the lock, complains about the food... even my hygiene!  Just pay the 800gp and take him!~
@98   = ~I refuse to take your charity. You'll simply have to wait.~
@99   = ~Most excellent! He is free so, please, take him and go. Remember, you do owe me 200gp.~
@100  = ~M-my apologies, Miss Nalia, I... I meant nothing...~
@101  = ~Magical slings are the hallmark of stout halfling warriors.  Usually their mothers or a talented aunt will create this sling for the halfling lad or lass who is about to embark on their second great adventure.  The reason that the sling is given on the second adventure and not the first is that many halflings decide not to pursue the life of an adventurer after getting a taste of it.

@102  = ~I have news of them, Miss Nalia, though it ain't all good. Lord de'Arnise was alive this morning, and I saw him taken into the keep by a real big troll, biggest I seen. Probably took him down to the...~
@103  = ~Cellars!  The 'cellars' is what they are.  I won't have them called otherwise in this day and age, despite their history.  It is by my father's order.~
@104  = ~Enough talk! We must get moving before we are discovered.~
@105  = ~We must get moving. If we are through here we should get to those cellars.~
@106  = ~More fools to rescue? Wonderful. Anything you can say that would help at all?~
@107  = ~A quaint notion, and one I would support. I think, however, that it would be hard to convince the old school of the merit of such a change.~
@108  = ~There was once a heavily brain damaged orc called Ano.  Ano was trudging through the forest one day, looking for bull droppings with which he could stuff his mattress, when he happened across a remarkable scene.  A brave and noble knight, Jen the Brilliant by name, fought with an evil giant.  Ano watched as Jen slew the giant.~
@109  = ~Did I mention that Ano had a nasty habit of interrupting folk?  Anyway, the giant's brother heard of his sibling's demise and the subsequent display of his head in Dung Town.  He caught up to Ano, who was stupidly stuffing his mattress with bull dung, and returned to his cave with the orc stuffed through his belt.~
@110  = ~As punishment for his brother's supposed murderer, he tied a porcupine to the orc's head and proceeded to clean his latrine with the makeshift orc brush.  Much to the giant's dismay, Ano actually enjoyed it.~
@111  = ~Enough, Daleson! I... I will tell. The cellar is a relic, a leftover from a time when our family... was not as caring as it could have been.~
@112  = ~Yes, Miss Nalia.~
@113  = ~Really?  Everyone I know has a pet wyvern.  Taming wyverns is child's play, literally.  As children, we'd tame wyverns.  It's easy since they have such an affinity for turtles.  Back in the old days it used to rain turtles on even days and frogs on odd days.~
@114  = ~Y-yes... yes, sir.~ [AERIE57]
@115  = ~Oh, I didn't think you could tame a wyvern.~
@116  = ~Long and far she'd roam, with Larry the Solar always at her side, fighting evil, mocking druids and the like.~
@117  = ~Anyway, my point is that Petunia and Larry were out for a stroll in the woods.  She was wearing her fruit armor, which was the style at the time, you understand.  Aunt Petunia always kept up with the style.~
@118  = ~I did say he was a necromancer, didn't I?  As I understand it, Lavok felt that tampering with the veil that separates life from death was his perogative.~ [VALYGA52]
@119  = ~Nalia, dearie, you remind me so much of Cletus Bifflelips, my second cousin, thrice removed.~ [JANJAN59]
@120  = ~After paying the thousand-gold-piece consulting fee and vomiting in the proffered bucket, the witch gave Cletus an herbal tea, which he was to drink twice per day for a score of days.~
@121  = ~All this traveling is beginning to wear on me... I can't remember the last time I walked so much in a single day.  Hah... it's something my Aunt should try, I think, instead of being hauled about in her gilded carriage.~ [NALIA53]
@122  = ~I do not understand. Aside from a few servants, we've seen very few dead. Where are the guards? They would have fought to the last. My father's bodyguard, Glaicus, should have been here in the bedroom, yet I see no body.~ [NALIA73]
@123  = ~They may have been captured for food. Perhaps they are storing the bodies elsewhere?~
@124  = ~You live this place? Then thrrgle you die! That was deal, and you die for sure! Rocksmash pack keep deal for Stronger!~ [TOGAL09]
@125  = ~No! Tell me who did this! If you are just the hired ruffians, who put you up to it!?  Damnation, you will tell me! Make him talk, <CHARNAME>!~ [NALIA89]
@126  = ~TorGal not talk! Rocksmash not talk! You not talk! We fight, then Rocksmash eat tthhrgunts! No talk!~ [TOGAL11]
@127  = ~I assure you, the servants were not spoiled. Aunty would not have tolerated it. The servants were loyal, I am certain. The guards were different though.~
@128  = ~I would not like to think about that. Some of the servants were good acquaintances. They appreciated my charity, I think.~
@129  = ~My... my home. My father... what is left? Someone has done this... but who...~ [NALIA74]
@130  = ~You may go if you wish.  I will stay... oh no. Wait!  Um, could you stay longer?  I need... oh forget it.  Damn it all, if it's not one thing it's another!~
@131  = ~I am thankful, and I will give you what reward I can.  Now that father is gone I have to... oh no.  Uh, could I persuade you to... uh... no. No, forget it.~
@132  = ~I will see what I can do.  Now that Father is gone I will have to... oh no.  Uh, wait!  Could you... no.  Forget I said anything.  You should go.~
@133  = ~Thank you. I bid you farewell.~
@134  = ~I see. You wish a marriage of convenience to stave off the advances of your intended.~
@135  = ~Imagine the scandal.  Who would believe I would have relations with you, even if you were the appropriate sex?  I mean, I am charitable, but really... err, no offense intended.~
@136  = ~That is hardly an acceptable solution! I will have no part of that! Though if it were to look like an accident... NO! No, I don't think that will be necessary.~
@137  = ~No, what I propose is something different. I doubt it will fool many people regardless, but it would save my home from what is sure to be ill use.~
@138  = ~Certainly this might not sound like a crisis to you, but I have spent my life trying to right some of the wrongs that have been done to those of lesser status.~
@139  = ~I was betrothed to Isaea Roenall, a brat of a man. Now they will surely push the arrangement, and I will be forced into a life of quiet nobility.~
@140  = ~You will do ceremonial things, but nothing overtly stressful. Please, the Roenalls would not use this place in a way that would honor my father.~
@141  = ~I accept. It will be an honor to guide this place through its troubles.~
@142  = ~But... very well.  I will remain here to do what must be done.  If you change your mind there is time before the Roenalls would be able to take over. Think about it.~
@143  = ~Does my captor know a way for me to gain power?

Imoen said something odd. Our captor apparently has some insight into my... condition as a Child of Bhaal.  He supposedly mentioned a means of allowing me to tap that power.  I am in no position to question him at the moment, but I will keep it in mind for the future.~
@144  = ~Monsters summoned~
@145  = ~This is the heart of the Sahuagin Prince Villynaty.~
@146  = ~The journal lists a number of experiments, apparently conducted by a mage known as Lium the Lucky. The section dealing with the machine in front of you draws your eye:

"What a wondrous contraption! It creates, enchants, and dispenses magical equipment of no small power by pulling these six levers in the correct order. The ranking of the levers seems to change daily and pulling them in the incorrect order results in painful and instant death, as I've deduced from the bloodstains on the floor. I've gotten the order correct for the last few days and sent the items home with Pooky. It is well that I found the machine when I did for it hasn't much life left. Each item it creates damages the inner workings further and soon I fear it shall fall apart. The previous order was:
1) Ruby
2) Jade
3) Mithril
4) Onyx
5) Emerald
6) Sandalwood. 

I've taken apart what pieces of the machine I could, and found the device that sets the ranking of the levers. With it, as stated, the order for the past several days was clear. Now the cursed thing has broken and I've garnered hardly any information from it at all. This is what I *have* discovered:
A) The Jade Lever's change in ranking was the greatest of the six levers.
B) The product of the Onyx Lever's rankings for the two days (when multiplied) is same as the product of the Sandalwood Lever's last two rankings when multiplied.
C) None of the levers are ever in the exact same place in line as they were yesterday.
D) Obviously, due to the change in the Jade Lever's order, there are only two possibilities regarding the change in the orders of the Onyx and Sandalwood Levers, one of which contradicts another clue.
E)  It is likely that the Mithril lever moved the same number of rankings as the Sandalwood Lever.

Quite the dilemma and the guesswork is risky. However, the items I've obtained are worth the risk and, with logic, I'm sure that I'll discover the correct order for today."

The journal says no more.~

@178  = ~Don't patronize me, Haer'Dalis, for I have never done the same to you.~
@179  = ~And I shall, Haer'Dalis.  I shall.~
@180  = ~No, but I would at least try to save him. I hope you do not make a habit of this.~
@181  = ~I suppose not. Very well, we will honor him by bringing his killer to justice.~
@182  = ~Mazzy, Mazzy, Mazzy.  All the ferocity of Cattie-Brie in a package half her size! ... You would have made a fine and noble knight, my little falcon.~
@183  = ~A word, good knight Anomen... in the last battle, I noticed you pulling back and parrying... Next time you see an opening like that, my advice is to take advantage of it.~ [HAERDA46]
@184  = ~That is the way of things. There will be... there will be payment for this crime, and I shall not rest until it is collected. When we are able, there will be...~
@185  = ~Enough. I would leave this place.~
@186  = ~I will not suffer this!  You will learn the limits and understand, but I will not bear this idiocy now!  Find your own path; I will not travel with you!~
@187  = ~Of course I am afraid, what fool wouldn't be? We were captured with little difficulty, held with even less, and have escaped with friends dead or wounded.~
@188  = ~We will exact vengeance when it is to our advantage.  I will not start a losing battle.  A guaranteed loss is a fool's endeavor.  Another day... another day...~
@189  = ~Yuan-Ti mage~
@190  = ~I couldn't agree more. Let's leave these heavy hitters and get out of here!~
@191  = ~Only an idiot is not afraid when he should be.  We were captured and held with ease!  Yes we have earned our freedom, but it was at the cost of our friends!~
@192  = ~Agreed. We will exact justice when we have hope of succeeding. Until then... I will not forget... another time and place...~
@193  = ~I know this place... these buildings. Yes, that person was assuredly correct; this is Athkatla. We are in the state of Amn.~ [JAHEIRH3]
@194  = ~I have no reason to doubt you. Are we far from the Sword Coast?~
@195  = ~You seem to know a lot about this place. Maybe too much.~
@196  = ~And how is it you know so much about his place?~
@197  = ~I... I am sorry? Do I know you?~ [JAHEIRD5]
@198  = ~Jaheira, my darling, so good to see you. Won't you come sit and chat a while?~ [BARONP02]
@199  = ~(AHEM) My name... is Ployer, Baron Ployer? Of the Calimshan Ployers? Come now, you must have some inkling?~
@200  = ~No... no, I am terribly sorry but your face is unfamiliar. Perhaps if you told me what you do...~
@201  = ~You... you... This is the type of insolence I was talking about! It is not enough that you ruin a man, you must also berate him!~
@202  = ~Haven't lost your fire, I see.  Still a Harper?  This scrawny lout one too?  That fellow Khalid you were once with was a better complement.  Is he here as well?~
@203  = ~Me? I don't think I could push my nose into other peoples' business far enough to qualify.~
@204  = ~I see. Well, if you travel with the one that harmed me it becomes my business. The 'friends of my enemies' and all that.~
@205  = ~Ah, but I am a weak, weak man that will live, while you are a strong woman that will die.  Give my regards to Belgrade when you see him. Hmmheheh... heheha..HAHA!~
@206  = ~By the horns of Silvanus, I'll plant him beneath the Stones of Aisath if I... if I...~ [JAHEIRH5]
@207  = ~No, I... I'm fine. I just felt a little strange for a moment. That... that fat excuse for a slaver, he's cursed me! Damn him!~
@208  = ~Well, I am sorry to hear that. I guess you'll be leaving the group then.~
@209  = ~This is a simple matter. We merely walk to a temple and have it removed.~
@210  = ~Are there Harpers that might help? I hear Elminster is a member. Honestly, with friends like that I don't know why you even bother to walk.~
@211  = ~I beg your pardon? I am to be cast out because of this? What is your reasoning?~
@212  = ~It is simple to understand. You require more maintenance than you are worth.~
@213  = ~No, I think this is more bothersome than it need be. The best option for me is to let you leave the group and go do this on your own.~
@214  = ~Again this side of you surfaces.  I should not have believed your apologies in Irenicus' dungeon.  I will not spend a... (cough)... a moment more in your company!~
@215  = ~That is not (cough) amusing, and it's not the first time you have acted such.  Perhaps you are colder than you let on, but I have little choice but to follow.~
@216  = ~There is always a better path than simply abandoning those that are weak.  You will not keep allies by demonstrating that you are willing to sacrifice them.~
@217  = ~Very well, though I should like to try and find Belgrade eventually. It has been...(cough)... it has been some time since we talked.~
@218  = ~A good first step. Hopefully he can give us some idea where Ployer might...(cough)... might be.~
@219  = ~Keldorn, my faithful hound... how is it that you came to be a paladin, anyhow?~ [HAERDA47]
@220  = ~Very true, lassie. You must work with potatoes.~ [JANJAN55]
@221  = ~Hmm?  Oh, I thought it was obvious.  Never had you pegged for a slow one, but you never can tell.  Allow me to spell it out... you see, about fifteen years ago I was employed by a mage of no small caliber.  Golodon the Unmanned was his name.  Good teeth.  Nice smell.  Vicious streak a mile wide.~
@222  = ~He couldn't have children, of course.  Nasty cone of cold accident, you see.  Regardless, his tower wasn't far from Athkatla and I managed to gain employment with the old elf for a while.  Mondays were particularly amusing.  Golodon would start the day off by summoning an imp.  He'd usually spend three or four hours making it run around the room barking like a dog.~
@223  = ~But, as it was with Golodon, he soon tired of the sport.  He had a beautiful mastiff named Buffy.  Her diet consisted almost entirely of imps. Imp doesn't taste half-bad when it's fried with a bit of garlic and butter. Goes well with turnips, too.~
@224  = ~Oh, right.  So anyway, Golodon's ex-wife lived no more than two hundred paces from the mages tower.  My primary job was poisoning her food, though occasionally I'd have to clean up Buffy's excrement.  She had managed to build quite the resistance to mandrake.  Golodon's ex-wife, that is, not the dog.~
@225  = ~It was truly a magical time in my life.  I haven't been as happy poisoning someone since then.  I was also, of course, poisoning Golodon on his ex-wife's behalf.  She did pay handsomely.~
@226  = ~If you must know, it was during my time as a mobile turnip vendor.~
@227  = ~Each trip I made, I would stop to talk to the halfling lass that worked in Uncle Scratchy's potato operation. The girl had had a very difficult life. She lost her parents to an orc attack when she was just a girl. She'd been a slave for the foul beasts until Aunt Petunia freed her.~
@228  = ~Perhaps we should be concentrating on our journey, good gnome.~
@229  = ~A noble tale in the end, Jan, though I'm continually puzzled by your need to inflict twenty minutes of inane yarns on your listeners before getting to the point.~
@230  = ~Yuan-Ti~
@231  = ~Aye, but then where would go the poetry, good knight?  Heh... but come, <CHARNAME> seems impatient with our chatter.  Let us put it off, then.~
@232  = ~Ooohhh, I did not find resting at all comfortable last eve. I...(cough!)... I just couldn't bring my eyes to close. My head pounds as thunder behind my temples.~ [JAHEIRH6]
@233  = ~I do not think this is going to work out. I cannot allow your curse to endanger me.~
@234  = ~... Cernd, you could have explained that in a manner that would not have involved me wincing.~
@235  = ~Do not joke so! I am in grave straits and you mock my condition with talk of leaving?~
@236  = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

Jaheira has been cursed by a man named Baron Ployer... a slaver whom she ruined in the course of her activities as a Harper.  The curse has already begun to take its toll on her... I have agreed to seek out Ployer in the poor sections of Athkatla, although Jaheira has suggested several other possibilities, as well.  One of these was to find the merchant Belgrade, possibly through the bartender Bernard at the Copper Coronet.  Another possibility was to ask after the wizards who cast the spell upon her by seeking information at the government building in the Government District.~

Jaheira has offered several possibilities... one is to seek out the merchant, Belgrade, at the Copper Coronet... perhaps by asking the bartender Bernard of his whereabouts.  Another was to look for Ployer in the poorer sections of town, although there seems little hope without some kind of direction.  Another possibility was to ask after the wizards who cast the spell upon her by seeking information at the government building in the Government District.~
@238  = ~If not for the promise of combat I would not bother looking for this 'Ployer.'~
@239  = ~Oh, I shall certainly save it. I shall save it just long enough to bring the fury of mother earth upon that fat slaver that would imprison her children.~
@240  = ~My wings have been clipped... oh, I wish you could understand how it feels to be bound to the ground, chained and weighted like a miserable prisoner of earth...~ [AERIE88]
@241  = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

I found a man named Corneil in the government building who seemed to be responsible for the Cowled Wizards in some way, but was certainly not very forthcoming... there is no help here for Jaheira that I can find.~
@242  = ~Forgive my outburst as well, I am...(cough)... I am not myself. Come, we must go. I will see that slaver pay for this.~
@243  = ~You!?  How did you find me?!  Blast, that Harper wench is cagey, but she is not with you?  Then my plan worked, she has withered and died!  I hope she suffered!~ [BARONP06]

@246  = ~CHAPTER SIX

As much as you have traveled, these last few feet to the surface have seemed the longest trek by far.  Your relief at seeing the light of the sky is palpable, even though you were not really fleeing the black of the Underdark, rather the constant treachery.  Unfortunately, even though the setting has changed, your immediate future still looks to be far from peaceful.  This area has been the staging ground for many recent battles, and judging from the faces of the beleaguered elven soldiers that now approach, there may be more to come.~ [CHAPT06]
@247  = ~Please, Jan, my name is Haer'Dalis.~ [HAERDA60]
@248  = ~She is incapacitated and your curse remains. I am here to ask you to remove what you have inflicted.~
@249  = ~She can be saved, so you ARE going to remove the curse because I am asking ever so nicely.~
@250  = ~Er... Attack!~
@251  = ~Now!... uh... Now!~
@252  = ~I command you! Kill them!... Where are you?!~
@253  = ~And now you will die. Will anyone weep for your passing? Allow me. Booooo hooooo. I cry for pathetic old Ployer.~
@254  = ~But... no! Damn you, it's happened again! Everyone against me, everyone.~
@255  = ~Very well.  Here, this is the personal item used to curse her.  I took it from that fop, Belgrade.  She should be fine with it returned.  Now get out... get out.~
@256  = ~My... life... pathetic am I? Pathetic!? I was... I was above all! I was more than you will ever be! I was... Mages or not, you will be dead!~
@257  = ~Unless... You will do as I wish and you will do it to the letter! Understand?!~
@258  = ~Despicable... (COUGH!)... you despicable wretch! You knew I would come here?~ [JAHEIRD6]
@259  = ~I am... I am not here to grovel, Ployer. You would sooner get that from my corpse!~
@260  = ~I feel... weak, but better. I...(cough!)... I thank you for helping me through this. You have earned my gratitude and... ehh... and I should really get a full day of rest.~ [JAHEIRC8]

@262  = ~Ahh, yes, I'm the one with enemies we need to worry about. Do you even believe that yourself? Don't make me lau... ow... laugh.~
@263  = ~(YAWN)... I'm... I live to see the earth mother's dawn once more? Then... then you have succeeded. Excellent. And Ployer? What of him?~
@264  = ~Dead and gone.~
@265  = ~Excuse... you may call me Terrece. I know of whom you seek, the mages in black and green? What is your business with my fellows? We are... available for hire.~
@266  = ~Perhaps he did not like your manner. It matters not. I know whom you seek.  I will relay what you wish to say. We... they have an interesting offer to present.~
@267  = ~Perhaps. The Cowled Wizards watch mages closely, so there is a demand for mages to perform certain... tasks. Especially if they guarantee not to get caught.~
@268  = ~Relay that I am going to exact a violent payment for my comrade's suffering!~
@269  = ~I take it you are a mercenary group of sorts.~
@270  = ~I will not associate with such as you!~
@271  = ~That is not a productive attitude. I am offering an appealing alternative.  If you will not get past your emotion we will have nothing further to say.~
@272  = ~As you wish. Our group was directed to harm one of your number, though it was just business. I am here to speak an offer of counter-employment.~
@273  = ~You have encountered us before, in less sociable circumstance. Now I am offering our assistance in performing a service for you.~
@274  = ~We performed a service for your enemy, but that contract has expired... though we have been asked to perform another task in the future.~
@275  = ~You may ask what guarantees you have that we will not turn on you in a likewise fashion... there is no guarantee but our dislike for Ployer.~
@276  = ~If words will not convey my meaning then perhaps violence will.~
@277  = ~Interesting.  Actively turning on an employer is bad for the reputation, though justifiable to those who know Ployer. Hmmm... two thousand gold, non-negotiable.~
@278  = ~It has been a pleasure helping you. We will, of course, ask that you do not speak of this. It would be... unfortunate.~
@279  = ~It will serve adequately. I look forward to... not... working with you or Mister Ployer again. Good day.~
@280  = ~I do not have enough gold for this. Would you consider doing it for free?~
@281  = ~No, no I don't think that will work at all. I am sorry we could not come to an agreement. We will meet again.~
@282  = ~No... no I don't think that will work. It will have to be one thousand.~
@283  = ~Just... just looking around. Don't let me keep you.~
@284  = ~No deals for a slayer of Harpers.~ [JAHEIRC9]
@285  = ~What can I do for... Jaheira?  Jaheira, no games now, you look like you've seen yer own ghost, or are about to.  Young lady, you look about ninety! Are you ill?~
@286  = ~I'm... I'm fine, Bernard. I just need...~
@287  = ~Bernard, I'm FINE. I just need... need some information. I need to find Belgrade.~
@288  = ~Ohh, Jaheira, you misunderstand me. Belgrade, he's... he's dead.~
@289  = ~D... dead? When?~
@290  = ~I see... Thank you, Bernard. I... I really must be going now.~
@291  = ~Might you help me? I have an interest in those taken by the Cowled Wizards.~
@292  = ~Jaheira is in dire straits. We have calmed her fevers, but she will die if not released from this spell.  This curse was fashioned specifically for her.~
@293  = ~How could it have affected her so quickly and totally?~
@294  = ~Hurry.  The spell is meant to kill only Jaheira... a personal item was used in the casting. Only recovering it, or the caster himself, may end this.~
@295  = ~Delay and she dies.  Some personal item of hers was used to cast this.  If this item were restored the spell might fade... or the caster could end it, himself.~
@296  = ~Jaheira? Child, are you here for ascension rites? I was not aware your time had arrived yet, and I... What is wrong, you look pale?~
@297  = ~Drenden, I... I am dying.~
@298  = ~Say nothing more. You will come and be administered to immediately! No discussions, I know how obstinate you can be.~
@299  = ~No arguments from... from me.~
@300  = ~Drenden, they have done nothing to me... I am... cursed. It cannot be removed. I cannot... I feel...~
@301  = ~It's... alright. Find... find Ployer and...~
@302  = ~I have a message for you, Miss Nalia from the residents of the Family de'Arnise estate. I must get an imprint of your signet ring to prove I found you.~

@305  = ~I cannot simply about face and charge off without first knowing why.~
@306  = ~Then that is what we will do. I would not allow you to miss it on my account.~
@307  = ~While I do sympathize with you, I simply cannot go at this time.~
@308  = ~Very well, I shall head in that direction at the next possible opportunity.~
@309  = ~It is simply out of the question. I have not the time, nor the desire.~
@310  = ~That is not an option at this time. We have things to do cannot be postponed.~
@311  = ~That is not an option at this time. We have things to do that take priority, and they cannot be postponed.~
@312  = ~This is a special circumstance.  I don't ask for much... well, besides rescuing my home and routing a legion of trolls.  Please, could we at least go soon?~
@313  = ~If you are that set on the matter then we shall go right now.~
@314  = ~I must insist that we go to Athkatla this instant. I'm sorry, but you did say we would go. I will leave on my own if I have to.~ [NALIA75]
@315  = ~I am sorry for delaying so long. We shall leave immediately.~
@316  = ~I saw what happened, and I share your helplessness. Any complaints about Officer Roenall must first go THROUGH him, so you can imagine how many get through.~
@317  = ~This did not come from me, for if my indiscretion against Isaea were to get out I should be thrown from the military. There is one way you can get to him.~
@318  = ~Isaea is quite corrupt and more than willing to exercise his power. You are not monitored as we, so you can do something that I or another guard cannot.~
@319  = ~Look to the docks and a man named Barg. Examine him and what he does, and you are sure to see what I mean.~
@320  = ~As you leave Suldanessellar, you are nearly overwhelmed by the cheering of the assembled crowds.  There is open gratitude on the faces of the elves, and many times you are encouraged to stop and receive gifts or shake hands.  There is an obvious lament at your departure, as well as an expectation of your return.  They consider you a hero and, for once, you really feel the part. 

You pass into the Forest of Tethyr, wondering if there could have been a future for you in the city that you have left behind.  You examine the amulet around your neck, studying the images of elven gods inlaid in the platinum, and you feel the warm tingle of the item's magic.  This gift will remind you of how welcome a visitor you would be, but it also bears witness to the fact that you are without a true home, a place where you belong.  You could return to Athkatla, you think, but deep inside you feel the taint that yet remains in your soul.

There can be no home for you yet, as hard as that is to admit, so you venture deeper into the forest, pondering the words of demons, and growing annoyed at how destiny holds its secrets from your view.~ [NARR04]

@336  = ~I say... I say take your name and eat it! I'll not be your puppet!~

@360  = ~I refer to unsavory business. Loan sharking, smuggling and so forth. Vaelag is a thief who pretends to be an honest merchant. Rumor has it that he reports directly to the Shadow Thieves.  Regardless, he was not a pleasant person. He was a bully and a cruel man. He enjoyed exercising power. He was also suave, sophisticated, and very, very rich.~
@361  = ~I had asked Lissa to marry me and she had agreed. We were to be married at the midsummer's festival the following year. That was before she'd met Vaelag. Like most men, he took a liking to her immediately.~

@372  = ~Aw, Uncle Gerhardt, how could you treat your own nephew so?~
@373  = ~I will not. Answer my questions.~
@374  = ~'Tis a hurt of the mind. Only one rich in such powers can heal her.~
@375  = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I have spoken to the avatar of a god that no longer has the faith of the guardians who live in this dungeon. He asked me to take the relic he has vowed to protect, and combine it with the half that the beholder has. I may use the completed item to destroy the beholder... on several conditions.  One: it can only be used once.   Two: that I tell his people I intend to complete the item so that it can be returned here and be destroyed fully.  Three: I bring the completed rod back and instill even the briefest moment of faith in his people, so the avatar might have the power to destroy the rod and end the service the guardians have been bound to.~
@376  = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

Now that I have returned with half of the rod, Sassar has told me of how to steal the other half from the beholder.  The beholder lives in a great pit in the cult's temple that cannot be entered directly.  I am to find a friend of Sassar's who stands near the Pit of the Faithless and, through him, gain access to a secret entrance to the pit and a niche where the beholder keeps his treasures... including the other half of the rod.~
@377  = ~'Tis no more than what ye deserved. Ye are truly a naughty child. Now piss off before I paddle yer bottom!~
@378  = ~I see from the look on your face that you've talked to Uncle Gerhardt. I should have better explained the situation. Gerhardt is a well-known and respected physician and scholar. He had risen above the poverty that plagues this family so. As you have seen, he's no longer the same.~ [JANJAN75]
@379  = ~About a decade ago, my Uncle was hired to treat a rather unsavory fellow, a thief named Ralg. It was fairly obvious that Ralg was a high-ranking Shadow Thief. He had power and money, two things more than rare in Athkatla without family connections.~
@380  = ~Ralg was also daring. There are places in this city where no sane man treads, places in the bowels of the earth that have the most powerful drow clerics quaver with fear at the mere mention of their cursed names. Ralg set into motion the systematic plunder of these places. He was a modern man, not given to the superstitious fears of the plebian masses.~
@381  = ~But that is in the past. He has examined Jaella and, especially in his present state, he knows things. He told Lissa to bring me home and I hope that he has given you some direction as to how we can help this girl.~
@382  = ~If that is your wish. I shall speak with Gerhardt myself. I cannot travel with you for a time. If you return in a week or two, I might be ready to travel again. I'm not sure how things will turn out here.~
@383  = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Well, it seems that Jerlia was wrong... Sir Sarles was able to tell the difference between the alloy and the real thing.  The sculptor left the city in a fit, and all I can do is bring this shapeless lump of metal to the temple and report my failure.~
@384  = ~Help Korgan recover the Book of Kaza.

I have joined with Korgan Bloodaxe to gain the Book of Kaza for a collector by the name of Pimlico. It is apparently in a tomb beneath the Grave District.  One of the crypts apparently leads to a lower, older section rumored to contain undead... but also the tome.~
@385  = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

Once the beholder is killed, I must return the rod to the avatar... he has warned me that it is cursed, and I would not want to know what would happen if I dared to use the rod a second time or try to spirit it away from this place.  Once that is done, I must also return to the temple and report my success.~
@386  = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Guardian Telwyn of the temple of Helm asked me to commission the master sculptor Sir Sarles to make a piece of artistry while he is in Athkatla.  I will need to procure illithium for the artist and convince him to lower his outlandish fee. The other temples in the city will also be vying for his favor.  Sir Sarles is staying in the Jysstev estate in the southeast corner of the Government District.~
@387  = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Dawnbringer Sain has asked that I commission the master sculptor Sir Sarles to produce a work for the temple.  I must procure illithium... a rare metal that he demands to work with... and also convince him to lower his outlandish fee.  Other temples will be vying for his services as well.  Sir Sarles can be found at the Jysstev Estate in the southeast portion of the Government District.~
@388  = ~Another mission for the temple.

Now that this business with the sculptor is completed, Dawnbringer Sain has asked that I return to speak with him as soon as I am able... to continue my service for the temple.~
@389  = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

I have met with the artist, Sir Sarles... but the only way he will perform the work is if I can procure 200 pounds of pure illithium.  Sarles recommended I locate an ore merchant by the name of Jerlia, who has a stall in the second tier in the southwest portion of Waukeen's Promenade.~
@390  = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

Jerlia has fashioned the illithium alloy for me... now all I need to do is give the metal to Sarles and hope that he does not distinguish between it and the real thing.~

@393  = ~Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills.

I spoke to Minister Lloyd of Imnesvale and agreed to find the cause of the murders and disappearances.  He suggested I look for the first victim, the ranger Merella. Her cabin is directly west of the village, and she used to patrol in the southwest portion of the local area.  Or I could deal with Madulf the ogre north of Imnesvale by the river.  The Minister believes him to be the source of the problem, anyway.~
@394  = ~Why? Did you not leave him because of his cruelty?~
@395  = ~It did seem like he was ready to kill you for insulting him. He's a violent sort who is used to power and seems to enjoy wielding it.~
@396  = ~He seems like a pleasant enough fellow. I wouldn't worry about it. Lissa does trust him, after all.~
@397  = ~Madulf wants to make a deal with the village.

It seems obvious that Madulf and his followers are not responsible for the deaths in Imnesvale.  If he can be believed, some of his people were murdered as well.  The ogre has asked me to bring word to Minister Lloyd and tell him that he wishes an alliance... Madulf and his followers will protect the village from the orcs in the hills if the villagers will leave them in peace and let them trade, occasionally.  I have agreed to bring this proposal before the mayor, but have not promised anything.~
@398  = ~You've been away too long, boy. You don't know whom you're talking to. Guards! Take him outside.~
@399  = ~You will stop this immediately! I am grateful for what you have done but you must not overstep your bounds. He is my husband and I love him.~

He seems to know that his kind of good-natured humor is well appreciated by most everyone he meets.~

@534  = ~Ranger-Protector of the Umar Hills

Delon of Imnesvale came and told me of a group of orcs that seems to have come down from the hills and attacked the village.  I have other things to do, so the boy left.  If I change my mind, I should go to the village within three days or it will be too late.~

I cam to the village and saved it from attack by a clan of orcs that had come down from the mountains.  Madulf the ogre, it seems, protected the village despite not having an alliance.  The mayor was surprised and is going to speak to the ogre about the possibility, now.~

A runner has come to me, stating that I must return to the de'Arnise keep as soon as possible... no more than a week... as Lord Farthington Roenall, the head of the family that wished to take Nalia's family's keep, desires to see me.~
@551  = ~Last Night I had a Dream.

I had a dream about Imoen and Irenicus.  At least, I think it was them.  Imoen was acting very strange, and spoke of how she seemed to be losing sight of her own identity.  Irenicus said that she would learn, and then he asked if I clung to the past or if I could "see through the pain."  I think the dream was referring to the experiments Irenicus was doing on me.  Something about my potential and what I could "take for my own" if I wanted.  Obviously I shall have to seek answers from Irenicus himself.  The shade in the dream was of no real help.~

@639  = ~Yes... I suppose now is not the time for talk.  Forgive me.~
@640  = ~It is, though... it was foolish of me to disregard my teachings.  And I have paid for it dearly.  I was bereft of my home... and then my wings, <CHARNAME>.~

I have freed a man named Haer'Dalis... an actor magically enslaved to the wizard Mekrath... who has joined my group and bade me to find a gem of his still in Mekrath's house.  Once it is located, I should seek out Raelis Shai at his playhouse beneath the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District for a reward.~
@765  = ~Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison.

Now that Raelis Shai has used the gem I acquired for them to open up her planar portals to return to their extra-planar home, it appears that the past has caught up to the troupe.  Haer'Dalis, Raelis and the rest of the actors have been arrested by bounty hunters and brought through a portal... which remains open.  They have ignored me, for now, which only begs the question of whether or not I will follow.~
@766  = ~Improved Invisibility 
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 4
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus. 

Note: after making an attack the mage is no longer completely invisible.  Opponents can target the mage. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@767  = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

After leaving the government building, I ran into a member of one of Baron Ployer's group of magicians, a man by the name of Terrece.  It seems they have little love for him as he offered me the opportunity to ensure that the magicians would not come to Ployer's aid the next time he called... an opportunity I took.  Now all that remains is tracking down Ployer, himself.~

It seems they have little love for him as he offered me the opportunity to ensure that the next time Ployer called on the magicians' aid, they would eliminate him... an opportunity I took.  Now all that remains is tracking down Ployer, himself.~
@772  = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

After leaving the government building, I ran into a representative of the group of magicians who cast the curse on Jaheira... a man by the name of Terrece.  He offered me the opportunity to bribe his group so as they would not come to Ployer's aid against me... apparently, they have little love for the man.  We could not come to a deal, however... and I am not even sure the man could be trusted, anyway.  It might simply have been one of Ployer's tricks.  Aside from all of this, I still need to locate Ployer, himself.~
@773  = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

It seems that Jaheira's fellow Harper friend, the merchant Belgrade, was killed by the same kind of curse that has been applied to Jaheira.  His body was found a couple of months previous in the east end of the slums... a better place than anywhere else to begin looking for Ployer.~
@774  = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

Jaheira has returned to the group, and has told me that she has been summoned to the Harper compound in Athkatla... and that I am to go there, as well.  I have agreed to do so, even though I am not told their reason, and Jaheira says we must go quickly.  The compound is in the Docks District of the city.~
@775  = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

Jaheira has returned to the group, and has told me that she has been summoned to the Harper compound in Athkatla... and that I am to go there, as well.  I am not to be told why, apparently... and Jaheira refused to tell me.  She left, in fact, to go there immediately and warned me that it would be best if I went to the compound as quickly as possible, where she would wait.  The whole thing smacks of the usual Harper scheming.~

@1112 = ~Ring of Gaxx
This ring is relatively unadorned, but the vile magic within radiates intense evil.  Indeed, its creator, Kangaxx, was no less evil himself, even before millennia of undeath honed his power.  It is said that a cadre of Netheril mages fought and imprisoned the demilich once, but being unable to truly destroy him they became liches themselves to stand guard over his remains.  The construction of the ring may have led to their enmity, as each of the gem's nine facets was supposedly empowered by sacrifice and death.

Isaea has returned and arrested Nalia through the abuse of his own power in the military.  He claims that she is 'under bad influences' and not acting according to her station.  Nalia protested, but he is the only one who can be complained to, apparently, so there seems to be no recourse.  I am not even sure where she is being held.~
@1125 = ~Samia's plan foiled.

Samia, the relic hunter in Firkraag's dungeon, was not what she seemed.  Her plan was to get a dupe to get the treasure within the tomb for her... and then kill whomever retrieved it with the help of her companions.  Fortunately, she has paid for her arrogance.~
@1126 = ~Lavok is dead, the sphere returned.

Lavok has returned the sphere to our home plane and is now dead.  Before he died, however, he granted the sphere to me... perhaps because I am a magic-user myself, I do not know.

I may know a scholar or two that would give their mothers for them, but 'tis not enough.  It could never be enough.  It really doesn't matter at this point regardless, as the damage is done and they have most likely disappeared.

The bracers remain a mystery, and I have no idea their true function.  In the past I have seen them wielded for horrific purpose, but any HUMAN that put them on was instantly killed as often as not.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said.  Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose.  "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whomever constructed it remains a mystery.  It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong.  It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right.  It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

Though the sword's blade is a focused, solid mass of fire, a hint of real fire will still be required to kill trolls once they are downed.

Short bow staves are about 5 feet long on the average.  As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges.

@1488 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:  

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history.  Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin.  When Raurin fell in 2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia.  Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged.  Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy.  All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity.  Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life.  Merchants were honored above all.  In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants.  During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the council of merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries.  War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement.  During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed.  Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath.  The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every ablebodied fighting man they sent.  The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts.  He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time.  He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things.  He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade.  He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems.  He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life.  Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range.  They roamed as far east as Kara Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa.  At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zaakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.

@1489 = ~History of Tethyr: 

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power.  When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne.  As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne.  Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so). 

The established recurring cycle was broken 10 years ago.  The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr.  King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr.  Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well.  Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies.  Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury.  These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change. 

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; it takes treachery as well.  In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir.  Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army.  While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile.  By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help. 

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates.  At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father.  A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government. 

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point.  Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire.  At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid. 

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family.  Once Castle Tethyr began to fall there was no holding back the mob.  In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin.  Everything of value - fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust. 

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos.  In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword.  This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding." 

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell.  Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived.  These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr. 

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted.  "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society.  The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@1490 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan.  Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people.  It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale.  His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network.  When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule.  Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule. 
~
@1491 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff.  The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died.  In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him.  In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales.  Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed.  Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~
@1492 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords.  Sylune and an adventuring company known as Manes' Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area.  The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonement by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader.  With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures. 
~
@1493 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates.  They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale.  Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship.  It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune(wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well. 

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network.  He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal.  Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people.  The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender.  Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.

@1494 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:  

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands.  Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Norhkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers.  The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby.  This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands.  On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@1495 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:  

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked - Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day. 

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land - freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.

@1496 = ~History of the Dead Three:  'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE' 

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything.  Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike.  When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom.  As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god.  Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well.  Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom.  In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.  

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal wielded.  The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt.  Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn.  No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn.  Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.  

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone.  Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes or noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled.  Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne.  

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. "And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours.  I have grown weary of this empty power.  Take it if you wish - I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position."  Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference.  When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.  "after all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing?  Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.  

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed.  Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls.  Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.  

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment.  After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize.  Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened.  "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players.  When Malar returned form chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant.  I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine.  All things must die - even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul.  Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.  

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

There are no records of this weapon's creator; nevertheless, its existence can be traced back among thieves and murderers to before Dalereckoning.  Its blackened blade was apparently forged from the arcane metals of an iron golem, giving the weapon an appearance as dark as its history.

Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd.  Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower.  Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat.  The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued.  He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

At first glance, this sword appears much like any other.  In the presence of any shapeshifting creature however, the blade becomes warm as its power stirs.  Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit.  Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him.  Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.

@1502 = ~Long Sword +2:  'Varscona'
Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies.  Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power.  In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form.  Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity.  Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts.  Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon.  Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own.  It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers.  In his loneliness he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet.  A nearby wizard, Galloma discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul.  The two fast became friends; master and apprentice.  Galloma died before Dramnek's tutorage could be completed however and the youth found himself once more alone in the world.  Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla.  There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma.  Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced Dramnek's weak physical body.  This weapon has no speed factor.

After serving at each other's side for the entirety of the war they fell in love and eventually married.  Historians report that Dergat named his war hammer after his bride to remind himself of the love he fought to protect.  What Lady Ashideena thought of this is unknown.

Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them.  Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon.  He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloat in his advantage.  The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed.  Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself.  The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest.  A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared to try and cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it.  With the help of powerful forest animals Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood.  The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest.  Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily . . . nay, VERY happily ever after!

He was beset by a cascade of arrows that nearly blocked out the sun, and he knew that even if he avoided the arrows himself, should his horse fall he would surely be doomed.  With his shield and body he positioned himself to take the brunt of the onslaught, and was mortally wounded for it.  His horse remained unscathed allowing for their escape, and his body was carried back to the nearest town, where he was resurrected from death.

The rest of his performance would involve the mocking of the newly clumsy individual, much to the delight of their comrades.  The ring was removed (by a method known only to the wily jester) only once the stooge had promised no reprisals for the treatment he had received; though Gregoria frequently still had to make a hasty retreat.

It could just have easily been a good book or bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving.  The helm has seen many great battles since its creation, but the simple virtue at its core is what has always been remembered.

@1548 = ~Helm of Infravision:  'The eyes of Truth'
Being a scavenger of a sort, Babette Maelestrom had this helm created to aid her in her dungeon excursions.  She would later attribute her gathered wealth solely to its power, though likely it was as much her keen eyes as anything.

@1550 = ~Perhaps, though you never did strike me as particularly manly.  Perhaps nature has just been slow in this regard.~
@1551 = ~I've traveled an arduous distance.  A Red Wizard of Thay needn't explain himself. If my inquiries are ignored, I will interrogate you in a painful fashion.~
@1552 = ~I know, I know. Fine. None of you are afraid to die... you just don't want to be there when it happens. I'll make this quick then.~

@1554 = ~There is a king's ransom for the kind soul who would be so obliging as to turn the impotent imposter over to the proper judicial authority.~
@1555 = ~Reward, eh? That's Edwin right there... the woman. Now that I've done a good turn it's time to show me the money.~
@1556 = ~What? I've no idea of what you are talking about. (What is this fool babbling to me for?)~
@1557 = ~In your own inimitable fashion, Edwin, you are prodigious... at lying. Certainly not at magic or spinning wholly credible yarns.~
@1558 = ~Edwin, I was not pampered, cajoled or spoiled!  True, I wanted for little, but yearned for more than wandering about estates.  Is it not true that you're of noble birthright yourself?  Calling the kettle Red, Wizard?~ [NALIA59]
@1559 = ~Ha ha ha... I see the soft spitfire does have a streak of wild child running through her.  Keep living in your sanctified ignorance, Nalia, it is part of your charm.~
@1560 = ~Yoshimo, every man has his follies and mistakes.  In your case, those are the most interesting and trustworthy attributes you possess.  (You are shiftier than me, and I don't trust myself.)~ [EDWIN54]
@1561 = ~Somewhere in you, something terrible gathers and grows.  (Can I spot kindred, or can I spot kindred?)~
@1562 = ~That's only love, warmth and candor for you and your red-robed ilk, Edwin.~

@1566 = ~Anomen, I've been intending to ask.  This Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart of which you belong... why is it that you lead the converted like lambs to the slaughter?~ [EDWIN55]
@1567 = ~So, Keldorn, as a disciple of a crooked deity, do you find solace in the same secret histories, books of lies and subversions that the rest of the miserable sheep in your horde do?~ [EDWIN57]
@1568 = ~Whatever lets you sleep, paladin.  (I'll dine on your eyes, cloistered coward... soon.)~

@1573 = ~At least I don't find it necessary to have others write my life for me or have its mundane plot plagiarized from common sources.~
@1574 = ~Dwarf, you speak the truth.  A warrior without peer, like you, must be an offense to nature.  The strongest in the most peril... strange how Fate weaves her tapestry.~

@1581 = ~Perhaps, wizard.  Perhaps.  Unlike yourself, however, I am an outcast from my people.~
@1582 = ~Flattery will serve you no purpose, male.  I will tell *you* when you may speak to me thus.~
@1583 = ~Familiars cannot pick up items.~
@1584 = ~Your words are strange, wizard. Stranger still are the thoughts behind them. Er... stand back a step if you don't mind. Boo has expressed a dislike for your company, and I cannot say I am surprised...~ [MINSC71]
@1585 = ~I am quite used to people mocking Boo. It no longer bothers either one of us. Laugh if you will, but Minsc hears what you cannot.~ [MINSC72]
@1586 = ~'Tis your self-fulfilling prophecy, Minsc.  I don't talk to hamsters, although my mouse does have a disposition of fair renown in certain select locales.~

@1589 = ~You threaten with your vaunted combat prowess?  The same esteemed skill that failed miserably to protect Dynaheir from harm's clutches?~

@1594 = ~Aye, and right quick. <CHARNAME>, make haste! We must head for my father's home in the Government District of Athkatla!~
@1595 = ~Mantle (Abjuration) 
Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of +3 or better enchantment.  This spell is incredibly powerful yet has a very short duration, and this combined with the very short casting time makes this spell useful only in the thick of intense combat.  It is also important to note that this spell will not work in conjunction with protection from magic weapons.  This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@1596 = ~Absolute Immunity (Abjuration) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of greater than +5 enchantment.  This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration.  However the casting time is also very short making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death.  It is important to note that this spell does not work in combination with protection from magic weapons.  This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~
@1597 = ~Death Fog (Evocation) 
Level: 6
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None 

The casting of a death fog spell creates an area of solid fog that has the additional property of being highly acidic.  All animal life not immune to acid suffers 8 points of damage for each round they are exposed to the vapors of the death fog.  Death fog will also instantly kill all summoned creatures, regardless of hit dice or immunities.~
@1598 = ~We have had a troubled season, and strangers of indeterminate nature are a potential threat until they prove otherwise. I am Lord Logan Coprith, High Merchant.~
@1599 = ~This is one of the few times that I actually require company and you abandon me. False friend! I cast you from my memory! You are nothing to me and shall remain nothing evermore.~
@1600 = ~Nay, you WILL lead us now.~
@1601 = ~Curse you for bringing me to this point! I leave now to never return! You false friend! My sister's memory has been dishonored by your twisted ways.~ [ANOMENA2]
@1602 = ~Must I prove myself to you? Very well. Tell me your troubles and I will rescue you.~
@1603 = ~Yes, m'lord. Nothing has changed. When your sister... died, things became worse.~
@1604 = ~Finger of Death (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 Creature
Saving Throw: Neg

The finger of death spell snuffs out the victim's life force.  The caster points his finger at the victim after the incantation is complete, effectively ripping the life out of his body unless a save vs. spells is made at -2.  A creature that successfully saves still receives 2d8 +1 points of damage.~
@1605 = ~Allies recruited for the struggle against Bodhi.

I asked Prelate Wessalen of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart for assistance in the battle against Bodhi, but he has refused.  His decision is final.~
@1606 = ~I spent much of my career in the military, but other duties called me here. My family was influential and it fell to them to provide a mayor for Trademeet.~
@1607 = ~That was a threat, was it not? What if I should decide to take offense?~
@1608 = ~Admirable, though I still sense that you do not find my company to your liking. I'll be leaving soon enough.~
@1609 = ~Trademeet has been here for generations, but now we are harassed from the strangest of sources. It has been a very difficult time for the local merchants.~ [CELOGA06]
@1610 = ~I do not like the indifferent way you offer your services. If you don't wish to hear what is troubling my town then tell me now.~
@1611 = ~Do you wish to hear my request for help now? Answer affirmative and I shall explain what has been happening to disrupt the trade of the local merchants.~
@1612 = ~Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills.

In Merella's cabin, I found a journal by the ranger and a note left by the adventurer I heard of earlier named Mazzy Fentan (left, it seems, for the unfortunate corpse present in the cabin).  Both seem to implicate that a wolf pack is responsible for the killings, and both Merella and Mazzy went onward to investigate this pack... and have not returned.  It seems likely that if I follow the directions given that I may find the answers to this mystery.~
@1613 = ~Well... heh heh heh... The prodigal son returns, heir to his mother's foolishness as always. Well, lemme ask you: how far have you roamed, son, running away from me?~ [COR02]
@1614 = ~Yet I was, and your father as well. Never forget that, boy! Your mother would still be alive if you children weren't such a handful.~
@1615 = ~For years I embarrassed him amongst the merchants, undercut his prices and stole his customers.  When my business failed he had a monopoly on the Calimshan shipping routes.~
@1616 = ~He would not be happy until I had nothing. By the end, Moira was all that I had, and now he's taken her too.~
@1617 = ~You should have been here, Anomen. Never forget that! It is too late to save her but your work is not yet finished, Anomen.~
@1618 = ~Power Word, Silence (conjuration/summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

In using this spell the wizard points at an individual and utters the power word.  For the next seven rounds, that creature cannot make any sound.  This silence completely foils any spells that require verbal components.  The only counters to this spell are Dispel Magic and Vocalize.  There is no saving throw.~
@1619 = ~Power Word, Stun (conjuration,summoning) 
Level: 7
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: None

When a Power Word, Stun spell is uttered, any creature of the mage's choice within visual range is stunned for the duration depending on its current hit points.  Creatures with 1 to 29 hit points are stunned for 4d4 rounds, those with 30 to 59 are stunned for 2d4 rounds, those with 60 to 89 are stunned for 1d4 rounds, and those with 90 or over are not affected.  Note that if a creature is weakened so that its hit points are below its usual maximum, the current number of hit points is used.~
@1620 = ~Power Word, Blind (conjuration/summoning) 
Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

When a Power Word, Blind spell is cast, one or more creatures within the area of effect become sightless.  The spellcaster selects one creature as the target center, and the effect spreads outward from the center, affecting all within a 10 foot radius.  This lasts for 6 rounds or until dispelled.  All of the effects of blindness apply to the victims such as a penalty to hit and to AC of 4.  As well the visibility range of the afflicted character is decreased.~
@1621 = ~I do not stoop to such tactics, even in the darkest of times. Such methods have no place here. Doubly so because I do not believe he is responsible.~
@1622 = ~Phantom Blade (Evocation) 
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands.  This silent construct is blade-shaped.  Its cutting edges inflict damage just as do those of a real sword.  The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with this weapon, at her normal THAC0.
        The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit.  However, due to its etheric nature it causes an extra +10 damage against undead.  This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~
@1623 = ~One would think so, but he is not guilty, of this I am sure. I can tell these things. He says he has been sent to investigate the druids himself.~
@1624 = ~Something like that, though it is more complicated. He is not guilty, of this I am sure. He says he has been sent to investigate his fellow druids.~
@1625 = ~Very well, though if we are challenged by any townsfolk it will be their deaths.~
@1626 = ~I will decide only when I have spoken with this man.~
@1627 = ~Those that attack will have taken their lives into their own hands. Do what you must, but I will not tolerate the killing of innocents. Keep that in mind.~
@1628 = ~Tenser's Transformation (Alteration) 
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/ level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power.  For when the wizard casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation.  The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, so he becomes a formidable fighting machine.  The spell causes the caster to become a berserk fighter.
          The wizard's hit points double, and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained.  The armor class of the wizard is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, up to a maximum armor class of -10.
          All attacks are as a fighter of the same level as the wizard (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved for fighters).  As well, each attack is made at +2, and each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage.  The effect lasts for the duration or until dispelled.

NOTE: This spell does not give the caster any extra attacks, and all magical abilities (both cast and innate) are unusable in the transformed state.~
@1629 = ~We are in your debt for whatever you did. I thank you, and Trademeet thanks you.  Not only have the attacks stopped but we have received reparations from the remaining druids.~ [CeLoga08]
@1630 = ~Hail and hello! Excuse my jovial manner but we have been celebrating. Trademeet was under siege not long ago, and now the attacks have simply stopped.~
@1631 = ~Perhaps he might. You shall have to ask him. I leave you to it. Other concerns of the town must still be dealt with.~
@1632 = ~Then I shall free him. A pity you will not meet him; he's interesting, and keen on traveling.  Farewell. Other concerns of the town must still be dealt with.~
@1633 = ~I have no interest in him.~
@1634 = ~Ahh, the blight shall pass and I will return to cultivate better relations when the time is right.~
@1635 = ~Your father is correct... your sister's murder cannot go unpunished.  Saerk is clearly evil, and is it not every knight's responsibility to destroy evil?~
@1636 = ~The answer is obvious. Everything that is wrong with this situation is the product of this man Saerk's scheming... your father's poverty and sister's death both.  Saerk's life shall surely be forefeit for that of your sister's, and his wealth will become your father's.~
@1637 = ~Black Blade of Disaster (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about three feet long.  It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell.  The caster is considered to be proficient to the point of grandmastery in this weapon.  The sword acts as a +6 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims.  Also, every time this hits a target, the victim must make a save vs. death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 hit points.~
@1638 = ~Coprith sent me, but I don't trust you. What exactly are you trying to do here?~
@1639 = ~I am indifferent about you. Once you are out of town you are on your own.~
@1640 = ~I am called <GABBER>. What have you to offer me in exchange for freedom?~
@1641 = ~Perhaps it could, but would you be willing to let your sister's killer go free so that you can join the Order?~
@1642 = ~You are honor-bound to the vows you made to the Order.  The path you are considering is evil, Anomen... do not take it.~
@1643 = ~Yes, I will help as best I can. Join with me and we shall do what must be done.~
@1644 = ~I will help as best I can, but I do not wish any more traveling companions.~
@1645 = ~This holds no interest for me and neither does your company. Go on your way.~
@1646 = ~Nor should I expect you to.  Druids alone should handle these squabbles, but I am thankful for what help you can give. Come, the grove is on your map.~
@1647 = ~I will mark its location for you on your map. Do hurry. What transpires there will regrettably affect others outside the order.~
@1648 = ~This is a matter that is best handled by the local authorities.~
@1649 = ~To be honest, I'm not sure that I trust your father's version of events. All that he speaks of seems to be colored by his hatred of Saerk.~
@1650 = ~I'm sure that many of the Order have faced difficult choices and yet have chosen to keep their vows. Do not take a mission of revenge.~
@1651 = ~Yes, I would be glad to have you in my party and help as best I can.~
@1652 = ~Protection From Magic Energy (Abjuration) 
Level: 6
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 turn /level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When the spell is cast it confers 100% invulnerability to all magic damage-based attacks such as magic missile or Abi Dalzim's Horrid Wilting.  This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@1653 = ~There's a WHAT in their chicken?

I purchased a Beljuril gem from a farmer in Imnesvale who had hidden it from thieves inside one of his chickens.  I paid the man a fair price, for which he was glad... apparently, his adventurer daughter had paid for the gem with her own life.~
@1654 = ~Go and investigate the local druids.  See how far their taint runs and then return to tell me.~
@1655 = ~If that is your choice, so be it.  I will remain here until I can accomplish this task on my own.  Perhaps if you change your mind... well, we shall see.~
@1656 = ~You return as the dusk, though I hope you choose not to bring darkness to this meeting. Have you decided to aid in the cleansing of this druid grove and end the suffering of Trademeet?~ [CERND63]
@1657 = ~Your investigations have been fruitful? Let us examine them for possible solutions to this regrettable situation. Speak what you have learned of the local druids. How are they tainted?~ [CERND64]
@1658 = ~Nay, father. It is time for this foolishness to end.~ [ANOMENB5]
@1659 = ~You have the ranger Minsc in your group. Likely he will also understand the danger of balance being lost, even though I have heard he has lost his own.~
@1660 = ~I have obeyed you all my life and received naught but bitterness in return. My friend and I shall take this matter to the magistrate, as the law requires.~
@1661 = ~You have seen the lifeless ashes of your sister, Anomen. Let not this terrible act go unpunished! Gird thy heart with righteous anger and slay thy sister's murderer!~
@1662 = ~Shut your mouth! If you leave now you are forever banished from this place. You will be cast from this family and become a nameless dog, not fit to cower at my feet!~ [COR08]
@1663 = ~I spoke with Faldorn, a Shadow Druid. She awaits challenge from another druid.~
@1664 = ~You have seen the grave of your sister, Anomen. Let this terrible act... not go unpunished! Gird thy heart with righteous anger and slay thy sister's murderer!~ [COR06]
@1665 = ~My son!  My son!  You have grown strong in your absence. Perhaps this knighthood you seek is the true path, after all. I am proud. You have restored our honor and our fortune.~ [COR07]
@1666 = ~I must get going, son.  My old employees must be found and reinstated.  I shall send for you when things have been set aright, Anomen.  Goodbye, son.~
@1667 = ~It... it is done, father. The murderer is dead and I pray that Moira's spirit rests easy because of it.~
@1668 = ~Good bye, father.~
@1669 = ~I am Sir Ryan Trawl, a Paladin of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. In Torm's name I greet thee.~
@1670 = ~Indeed it has. In the name of the Prelate, the council requests your return to the High Hall.~
@1671 = ~And also thee.~
@1672 = ~Invisible Stalker
(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the elemental plane of Air.  This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death.  The creature remains under the caster's control for 9 hours or until it is killed -- at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.~
@1673 = ~I refer to, of course, my possible acceptance into the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, as a knight. We must travel there soon, else I shall be judged unworthy by default.~
@1674 = ~Excellent. We are all the stronger having joined. Let's go quickly, before she rallies any more wayward druids to her cause.~
@1675 = ~Then we will go there presently and you may watch my victory or defeat. For all concerned, I hope I am the champion nature deserves.~
@1676 = ~Excellent. Let us waste no more time with idle chatter.~
@1677 = ~I need not put up with this nonsense. I shall set out on my own for the High Hall, since you seem intent on keeping me from my commitments! You have caused me to be late in arriving at my own Judgement.~ [ANOMENB3]
@1678 = ~I thank you. Once this matter is resolved I will be more than happy to assist you in your endeavors.~
@1679 = ~I feared Shadow Druids were to take this land and was sent from the north to investigate, but now I hear I am no longer needed?~
@1680 = ~That is true. We saw the trouble brewing in this place and decided to take action.~
@1681 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

It appears that Tolgerias, a Cowled Wizard, has taken my promise to perform an unnamed service for him seriously.  He had asked me to track down a man by the name of Valygar Corthala and bring him back dead or alive.  I refused... and may face retaliation from the Cowled Wizards as a result.~
@1682 = ~Anomen Delryn, do you stand before me seeking a knighthood of the Order?~
@1683 = ~I do so stand.~
@1684 = ~If that is what you wish, though I have enjoyed the interesting travels we have made. If you wish to meet with me again I will be at the druid grove.~
@1685 = ~It will be a while before all is well, but for now things are stable. I might even be able to leave... if you had need of an extra hand once more.~
@1686 = ~You have slain a man in revenge. By killing Saerk you have committed an unforgivable sin. Consider yourself lucky to be able to leave with your life.~
@1687 = ~Do as the Prelate suggests, Anomen. You have worn out your welcome and must no longer taint this place with your presence.~
@1688 = ~As I said, you may leave now, Anomen.~
@1689 = ~In short, I've bettered myself in every way so that I might someday be Judged worthy of knighthood.~

@1707 = ~I... I won't let my friends be hurt!~ [AERIE12]
@1708 = ~It would seem that the Prelate's decision is irreversible. There is nothing that we can do but move on and return to the road.~

@1710 = ~This is not a good time to have a conversation, Anomen.~

@1712 = ~Very well.  Two summers past, chosen squires of Torm were invited to a tournament in Riatavin.  I traveled as the captain of our delegation, of course.~

@1718 = ~Sword of Arvoreen

Another gift to Mazzy from Arvoreen, this short sword may only be used by halflings.  The enchantments that exist within this sword give it the ability to slow any opponent struck by it.

@1719 = ~Delryn Family Shield +1

This is Anomen's family shield, given to him by his father.  In addition to the magical protection the shield radiates an aura that grants the wielder fire and cold resistance.  To protect against ranged attacks, Anomen can use the shield to erect a field of energy.  This protection from normal missiles can be used three times per day.

@1720 = ~Firecam Full-Plate Armor

Full plate armor is the best armor a warrior can buy, both in appearance and protection.  This armor increases the wearer's armor class by one above that of normal Full-Plate.  While equipped the suit provides the wearer with a +1 bonus to all saving throws and grants the wearer with limited free action (able to pass through webs and other effects).  This suit was designed for Keldorn and few other than he can wear it.

@1722 = ~Hallowed Redeemer

Keldorn distinguished himself early in his career as a paladin, and received this blade as a boon from Torm.  It is exceptionally accurate, but also protects him in battle with a special Fireshield, and any that strike him while he wields it suffer Torm's wrath in the form of magical damage. None but Keldorn may use this sword.

STATISTICS:

Equipped Abilities: 5 points of magic damage to any who deal out any damage to the wielder.

@1724 = ~Staff of the High Forest

This staff was the culmination of a cycle of seasons in which Cernd meditated on his role within nature.  His perch for this personal journey was next to a sapling, a young oak that was a particular interest of study; it seemed odd, and yet somehow wonderfully ordered.  At the coming of spring Cernd examined it one last time, and it came loose in his hands, a living staff, granted as boon from nature herself.  It has grown to fit his grip, and few others may wield it.

@1725 = ~Cloak of the High Forest

When younger, Cernd spent a cycle of seasons meditating on his role within nature.  He made no shelter, wanting to feel the land unhindered.  Nature may have appreciated the intent, she also knows that, for all their dedication, at times her children can be foolish.  Cernd found this cloak before the cold season set in, seemingly woven to fit him from the very undergrowth.  The message was clear: he can appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it.  Only Cernd may use this cloak.

@1728 = ~I see.  There are matters so solemn that only levity cures their sting.~
@1729 = ~Oh, you are pathetic, Keldorn.  You are a hypocrite and a liar.  You care nothing for me, only for your honor. Why should I believe anything you say?  I'd spit in your face, but you aren't worth even that!~ [ANOMEN59]

@1760 = ~Certainly, make fun if you wish, but you... did not deserve my insults.  You are the only surfacer who has treated me fairly, and not demanded something in return.~
@1761 = ~Chapter 3

Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source... a guild filled with vampires and perhaps even greater evils.

The enemies of the Shadow Thieves are now my enemy, of that I am sure.  Gaelan has sent me with a key to meet the Shadowmaster of the Shadow Thieves, he who controls the entirety of this powerful organization: Aran Linvail.  This is by far preferable to receiving 'help' from vampires... although I somehow doubt that the gold I gave Gaelan is the last of the final price I will have to pay for help from the Shadow Thieves.~

@1765 = ~You... you are not too bad to travel with.  For a lowly male, that is.~
@1766 = ~Understood what? No, Cernd, how could you ask her to understand something that you do not? Yes, nature called to you and you went, but no doubt you were afraid to stay.~

@1768 = ~With child, Cernd, you left with your child on the way.~
@1769 = ~She never... I never heard... When did she...?~
@1770 = ~Within nine months of your leaving, I would imagine. Not quite as attuned with nature as you thought, eh?  Or did you subconsciously know and left because of it?~
@1771 = ~I thank you, Igarol, even though this news is most troubling. I must speak with Galia and tell her... tell her my thoughts.~
@1772 = ~Why not?  All that I am has been gained through my own strength.  Ye've naught but that which is doled out to you by a frolicking godling.~
@1773 = ~'Tis obvious, dwarf, that you speak out of jealousy.  So, too, would I, in your position.~

@1777 = ~Oh, how intriguing. If I didn't know better, it would seem that there is an unsavory attraction between you two.~
@1778 = ~It is a path of conscience.  Some druids choose a contemplative lifestyle, but I sought a more active role in the furthering of nature's cause.  And you?  Did you become a priest of Helm only for honor and glory?~ [JAHEIR62]

@1784 = ~I wish to... apologize... for attempting to unburden myself upon you before.  I was foolish to be so weak in Beregost, and worse yet to speak to you about it.~ [VICONI69]

@1792 = ~True enough, but I think I was speaking of emotional markings.~
@1793 = ~I must take this path. I did care for Galia, but it was not to be. I thought I had laid these things to rest, but it appears I didn't do a very good job.~
@1794 = ~This is a vicious weapon used by Neb, covered with old blood and coated in a poison that is both quick-acting and extremely deadly.  Only the truly evil would dare to use this item on their own.  Once the poison is used up, however, Neb's Cutter will act as a normal enchanted dagger.

@1869 = ~I have not followed her orders as she might have wished. If I had, you and I would not be speaking. I warn people away when I can but I am not skilled enough to openly oppose her.~
@1870 = ~You have spoken with Cernd? I had hoped he or another would be sent to help. He serves the Grand Druid in the north. He will know what to do with this Faldorn.~
@1871 = ~Backing down from a fight then? I think you should learn not to make threats you cannot enforce!~
@1872 = ~Quiet! Oh... damn it all, they've heard. Others do not stop to chat. Do not say I didn't warn you. I gave you a chance, but no, you wanted to butt heads. So be it, I tried.~
@1873 = ~Then you might end this! We have not experienced a Shadow Druid before; we are not strong enough to defeat her. I... I must go; she would harshly punish treachery.~
@1874 = ~Dalok, what is the meaning of this?~
@1875 = ~A Shadow Druid! They are perversions of our calling!~
@1876 = ~Some obey out of fear but, I think her way is better. We fight for nature and take what we wish from the city fools. I will stop your feeble attempt to interfere, Cernd!~
@1877 = ~Doppelganger~
@1878 = ~Greater Doppelganger~
@1879 = ~DWARVES:  Dwarves are short stocky fellows, easily identifiable by their size and shape.  They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair.  Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn.  They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor.  They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold.  Dwarves have a natural resistance to magic and poison.  They possess infravision, which allows them to see in the dark.  They gain a bonus to their constitution, but incur a penalty to their charisma and dexterity.    There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the Realms:  Shield dwarves, Gold dwarves, Wild dwarves, and Duergar.~
@1880 = ~ELVES:  Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than normal humans.  Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones.  Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof.  They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing,  frolicking, and other similar pursuits.  Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry.  Elves have a natural resistance to charm and sleep magics.  They can see in the dark with infravision, and they are very skilled in the use of the bow and long sword, receiving a +1 bonus on their To Hit rolls with them.  Elves have a bonus to their dexterity, but incur a penalty to their constitution.   There are five racial divisions of elves within the Realms:  Gold elves, Moon elves, Wild elves, Sea elves, and Drow.~
@1881 = ~GNOMES:  Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins.  Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves.  Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses.  Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes.  They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry.  Gnomes have natural resistance to magic.  They can see in the dark with infravision.  They gain a bonus to their intelligence scores, but incur a penalty to their wisdom.~
@1882 = ~HALFLINGS:  Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid.  Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. Halflings are highly resistant to poisons and magic. They are naturally skilled with slings as weapons, receiving a +1 bonus on their To Hit rolls with them, and have a limited ability to see in the dark. They receive a bonus to their dexterity, and incur a penalty to their strength. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the Realms: the Hairfoot, Tallfellow, and Stout.~
@1883 = ~FIGHTER:  The fighter is a champion, duelist, soldier, and brawler, who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics.  Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains.  A good fighter needs to be strong and healthy to survive.~
@1884 = ~RANGER: The ranger is a warrior of the woods, skilled with weapons and knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. The ranger often protects and guides lost travelers and honest peasant-folk.  A ranger needs to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.~
@1885 = ~PALADIN:  A paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true.  Like the fighter, the paladin is a champion of battle.  However, the paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry, striving to be a living example of these virtues so that others might learn and benefit from the paladin's actions.~
@1886 = ~CLERIC: The cleric is a priest, of any mythos, who tends to the spiritual needs of a community as both protector and healer. The cleric is not purely defensive, however, and is well-suited to seek out and destroy threats when they arise.~
@1887 = ~DRUID: Like the cleric, the druid is a priest, but for the ethos of nature and neutrality in the temple of the wilderness. The druid's special powers are devoted to the protection of the natural order and the preservation of balance in the world.~
@1888 = ~THIEF: Cunning, nimbleness and stealth are the hallmarks and means to an end for this skilled pilferer. Whether these talents are turned against innocent passers-by and honest merchants, or oppressors and monsters, is a choice for the thief to make.~
@1889 = ~BARD: The bard is also a rogue, but a very different one from the thief. The bard's strength is a pleasant and charming personality. With charm and wit is the bard's way made through the world. A bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore, who learns a little bit about everything; a bard is a is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.~
@1890 = ~MAGE:  The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, the mage studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical research.  A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Only the most powerful are ever seen adventuring without a retinue of warriors and other partisans. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The mage can study all types of magic and learn the widest variety of spells, or choose to specialize, but will always have a broad enough range to be well-suited to the demands of adventuring.~
@1891 = ~CONJURER:  A mage that specializes in creating useful creatures and objects.

Opposition School:  Divination~
@1892 = ~FIGHTER/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a thief and a fighter, though they cannot use their thieving skills while wearing armor other than leather, studded leather or elven chainmail.~
@1893 = ~FIGHTER/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a cleric, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~
@1894 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a mage, though they cannot cast spells while wearing armor other then elven chainmail.  Gnomes can choose this multi-class, but become fighter/illusionists by default.  Gnomes are the only race that can combine a specialist mage class in a multi-class.~
@1895 = ~MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a mage and a thief, though they will not be able to cast spells while wearing armor other than elven chainmail.~
@1896 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ THIEF:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and thief. They cannot use their thieving skills while wearing armor other than leather, studded leather or elven chainmail, and cannot cast spells while wearing any armor other than elven chainmail.~
@1897 = ~MAGE/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a mage and a cleric, though they will not be able to cast mage spells while wearing armor other then elven chainmail.~
@1898 = ~THIEF/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a thief and cleric, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~
@1899 = ~FIGHTER/ DRUID:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter and druid, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the druid's ethos (scimitar, dagger, club, spear, quarterstaff, dart and sling.)~
@1900 = ~CLERIC/ RANGER:  This character can use the abilities of a cleric and ranger, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~
@1901 = ~FIGHTER/ MAGE/ CLERIC:  This character can use the abilities of a fighter, mage, and cleric, though they cannot cast mage spells while wearing any armor other than elven chainmail, and are restricted to weapons allowed by the cleric's ethos, which prohibits the use of bladed or pointed weapons.~
@1902 = ~STRENGTH:  Strength measures a character's muscle, endurance, and stamina.  It is the prime requisite of fighters.
Minimum: <MINIMUM>
Maximum: <MAXIMUM>~
@1903 = ~You have been given proficiencies to start your character with.  These represent the ability to effectively use weapons.  You may choose from any of the selectable proficiencies available to your character class.  A fighter character will be able to choose the same proficiency up to five times.  This will grant additional levels of specialization with the weapon listed.  Keep in mind that a character can use any weapon available to their race and class whether proficient with it or not.  However, there will be a minus to the attack roll if the character attacks with a non-proficient weapon.

Proficiency Slot Table:
1 slot: none
2 slots: +1 to hit, +2 to damage, an extra half attack.
3 slots: +2 to hit, +2 to damage, an extra half attack.
4 slots: +2 to hit, +2 to damage, an extra half attack. -1 to speed 
5 slots: +2 to hit, +3 to damage, an extra half attack. -1 to speed~
@1904 = ~BOW:  This weapon class allows the character to use Long bows, Composite Long bows, and Short bows. Only Fighters, Rangers, and Paladins can use the Composite Long bow. Thieves can choose this category, but are restricted to Short Bows only.~
@1905 = ~OPEN LOCKS (Thievery):  A thief uses this ability to pick pad locks, door locks and combination locks.~
@1906 = ~LAWFUL GOOD:  Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.~
@1907 = ~LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior.~
@1908 = ~NEUTRAL GOOD:  These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character.~
@1909 = ~NEUTRAL EVIL: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters.~
@1910 = ~NEUTRAL: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention. True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world.~
@1911 = ~CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.~
@1912 = ~CHAOTIC EVIL: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.~
@1913 = ~I am stronger than ever with the aid of this grove. No harm can come to me here. Such bonding rituals are frowned upon as they draw energy from the earth itself, but the mother feeds me that I might fight for her!~ [CEFALD07]
@1914 = ~The rituals of ascension still rule here. Cernd will challenge you for leadership.~
@1915 = ~It's not so much worry as it is... uncertainty. I'd just rather leave it alone.~
@1916 = ~I've lost trusted allies, lovers, friends... we've all suffered through the grief and loss, <CHARNAME>. All of us here have endured staggering pain.~
@1917 = ~That doesn't make it any easier, Viconia.~
@1918 = ~Without a doubt, you are the most noble person I have ever met.  Your good deeds shall be lauded always and I am proud to serve beneath you.  Bravo!  You are an inspiration to me.~ [MAZZY71]
@1919 = ~The Drow have superb tactile sense, <CHARNAME>. We feel blood flowing, rushing through passages and caverns... thrilling with the right company.~
@1920 = ~Your shyness is quite charming, <CHARNAME>, but I speak with clarity gleaned from experience.~
@1921 = ~Well, if it is my 'chatter' that bothers you, I shall leave you in quiet, then, so you may exercise what little gray matter remains within your skull.~
@1922 = ~... Thank you, Keldorn. My love. So... So you will stay?~
@1923 = ~I'm not ready to settle... I still have questions that must be answered.~
@1924 = ~The altar has been cleaned and inscribed by Mazzy. It now stands as a monument to her brave companions who gave their lives in an attempt to defeat the Shade Lord.~
@1925 = ~I believe the lady said she didn't want anything.~
@1926 = ~Yes, I have noticed the type of man that you are.  Intense, determined, strong... all the qualities that I have grown to like most in colnbluth exist in you.~
@1927 = ~Nalia Abducted By Isaea Roenall

I approached Corgeig, Isaea's superior in the government building, but without evidence he considers the matter pretty much my word against Isaea's, and will not consider any arguments from me until I have concrete evidence of Isaea's wrong-doing.~
@1928 = ~Well said, sir! Some of us are reluctant to accept affections. A little encouragement is all that is needed. Now, please return to see my other wares, will you.~
@1929 = ~I have toyed with your feelings unfairly, placing you down with the other males I have known... and you have not been like them.  It was... wrong of me.~
@1930 = ~I... guess it's understandable.  Don't worry about it.~
@1931 = ~You sting me, but I shall let it pass.  I enjoy seeing anger in you... it shows promise.  We Drow make few apologies for the way we are, and I make no promises.~
@1932 = ~This... acceptance of yours is much more difficult to take.  But I suppose I should be grateful for it.~
@1933 = ~Not now... tell me some other time, perhaps.~
@1934 = ~Lolth had abandoned me, and I was alone in a strange world.  Those rivvin who saw me hounded me with abandon, and I fled to the forests.~
@1935 = ~There I was hunted by the darthiir... surface elves... and their honed hatred drove me further.  I was sure I would perish, never to see the Underdark again.~
@1936 = ~You've a flair for melodrama, Viconia.  But I'm losing interest... tell it to someone else.~
@1937 = ~'At's alright then. You just watch your step and such.~
@1938 = ~Hey, you look like you're a bit important. Like you're a bit tough and such. You got any... ah... special things you need taken care of?~
@1939 = ~I don't know what you are talkin'... I... I ain't done anything wrong! I'm just a simple gravekeeper, ain't no crime here!~
@1940 = ~Yeah, yeah pretty goo... I mean... No! No, nothing like that here!~
@1941 = ~Tell me... has there ever been anyone special to you?  A thief of your heart?~ [VICONI76]
@1942 = ~No?  Is it not possible then?  Could she exist: a woman who makes your pulse quicken by her closeness... who enflames you by a mere glance?~
@1943 = ~You think so?  I cannot wait for the final act of this play, then... I am sure it will be worth waiting for.~
@1944 = ~When the heart beats true, its song is a delight to hear.~
@1945 = ~Your heart is heavy with lust and burning desire, and beats proudly and strongly... but shall it be mine or is it another's?~
@1946 = ~You are steering this conversation into dangerous territory, Viconia... exactly what do you intend?~
@1947 = ~M'lady Maria has but one husband and it is I... As for Vesper and Leona, how dare you defile them with your presence?!~
@1948 = ~They yearn for a father -- any father... even an imposter off the street in your stead!  Be to them in your compassion what you are to them in blood, Keldorn.~
@1949 = ~I would settle down if I had the choice, yes.~
@1950 = ~It would be nice, wouldn't it <CHARNAME>?  To leave the insidious schemes and psychopathic madmen for others to battle and prevail over?~
@1951 = ~You could leave this wretched excuse for a life anytime, Viconia.~
@1952 = ~I will definitely consider its value and place in my life, <CHARNAME>.  I appreciate your words of friendship, as well... it is not words I am familiar with.~
@1953 = ~Hey kid, the world is full of disillusionments, live with it.~
@1954 = ~But doing so would mean never returning to the other path.  Something to ponder over, I think.~
@1955 = ~Hmmm... I am wondering this: do you ever entertain the notion of marriage?~ [VICONI78]
@1956 = ~Of course I have.  Who doesn't?~
@1957 = ~Variety is the spice of life.  The drudgery of having the same partner... it would have to be a unique and special person, indeed.~
@1958 = ~Don't fluster yourself with lurid daydreams, <CHARNAME>.~
@1959 = ~Why are druids attacking all who enter the wood? This is not our role! Where is the balance in this?~
@1960 = ~Why are druids attacking all who enter the wood? This is not the role of the druid!~
@1961 = ~Cernd would know what has changed here, and why you rule as you do.~
@1962 = ~RRarp!! Grrrr...~
@1963 = ~There's a WHAT in their chicken?

A farmer named Jeb told me that the Hendricks... fellow farmers who have fled from the outlying lands into Imnesvale... may have put something down the gullets of one of their chickens, something that their adventuring daughter brought home with her before she died.  Considering the Hendricks went through that much effort to hide it, it may be something quite valuable.~
@1964 = ~Please disregard the things I said to you earlier.  They were ill-conceived.  You... you are not drow and not worthy of such insults.~ [VICONI80]
@1965 = ~I have been told a little about this 'Bhaal' of yours, but I am unfamiliar with him.  Among the drow, we are taught nothing of other gods, and little enough about our own gods beyond Lolth.~ [VICONI81]
@1966 = ~You speak often of the Underdark... do you miss it at all?~
@1967 = ~Let's escape from this madhouse.~
@1968 = ~This Amulet can be activated by a simple command word and a touch with each use acting as one charge.  The effect is a duplication of the 1st level wizard spell 'Shield'.

After a difficult battle, the keep of Nalia's family has finally been cleared of its troll invaders.  Unfortunately, Lord de'Arnise could not be rescued and had been killed by the troll leader, TorGal.  Nalia, however, remains alive... although her future in her own keep seems anything less than certain.~
@1983 = ~Helping Tiris in Trademeet

I returned to Tiris to tell him the good news... that Rejiek Hidesman and the other Skin Dancer, Darsidian, were finally dead and Raissa was restored... but he had already received it.  Raissa and he had left to be married and his parents were overjoyed.  Sometimes things work out, it seems.~
@1984 = ~No... nor am I particularly interested in hearing the tale.~
@1985 = ~I lapsed when a child... a baby... was to die: it would not have made Lolth stronger or more influential or made her a greater deity.  I lost my will that day.~

@1987 = ~Valygar's family quest is over.

Valygar told me that Lavok has granted me the planar sphere to use as I wished... simply requesting that I use it with more wisdom than he had.  I have no knowledge of how the sphere is used or what its secrets are... but it is the sort of base that no other mage in Faerun would have access to, that is certain.~
@1988 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

I encountered a friend of Valygar's, a ranger by the name of Suna Seni.  She told me a little of the man... he is a ranger, for starters, and belongs to a family that is under some kind of curse.  He is fairly wealthy, having a home in the Docks District and some wild land out in the Umar Hills.  She doesn't seem to think he has any particular hatred of the Cowled Wizards and seems quite fond of him, overall.~

@1995 = ~But... you obviously did survive.  What happened next?~
@1996 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proclaims that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the utter east, though his affinity for animals speaks to his skill as a ranger as well.  He originally came to the Sword Coast on a dajemma, a ritual journey to manhood, as the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir.  To his shame, Dynaheir is now dead, and he fears that the doors of the honored Ice Dragon Berserker Lodge are forever closed to him.  This personal tragedy has obviously not strengthened Minsc's hold on reality, as evidenced by his continued dependence on his animal companion 'Boo', a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster.  Apparently such things do exist somewhere in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head.~
@1997 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale.~

@1999 = ~When you ask about her recent past, VICONIA snarls that it is not your place to know such things of her.  There is still pride in her voice when she speaks about her Underdark home of Menzoberranzan, but you get the feeling that there is nothing left for her there, her family and House most likely victims of typically vicious Drow 'politics'.  She has continued in her worship of the Night Goddess Shar, but that appears to have been the only boon to her exile.  She seems sullen and bitter, and has certainly learned much of the intolerance she must face while living amongst surface peoples.  Her natural abilities as a Drow have faded with time, also contributing to her lost sense of belonging.~

@2081 = ~CAUTION! 
Dual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the description given in the manual. 

Dual-classing is an ability that only humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you will only gain experience in the second. 
In order to become dual-classed you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of your current class, and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to change to.  Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or inherent restrictions. Within Baldur's Gate II all resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.

Dual-class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: a Mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a Thief combination cannot use thieving skills wearing other than leather or elven chain armors, and a Cleric or Druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow.

When you gain a level, you will have the option to change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes "inactive" and you begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From then on you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your first class will forever remain at its current level.

You will be unable to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 10th level mage and switched to a fighter, you would not be able to use your mage abilities again until you reached 11th level as a fighter

IMPORTANT: The experience cap in Baldur's Gate II is 8,000,000 points for a single character. Experience points from BOTH of a dual-classed character's classes count towards this total. Please be sure that there are sufficient points left available to allow you to progress high enough in your second class! IF YOU ARE LEVEL 23 IN YOUR CURRENT CLASS, IT IS VERY LIKELY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REACH LEVEL 24 IN A SECOND CLASS. The game will still allow you to dual if you wish, but you may not be able to access your previous class' abilities within Baldur's Gate II. This may result in difficulty later in the game. Consult your manual's experience point table if required.~

@2086 = ~Minor Spell Deflection (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the 6th-level Spell Deflection, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed.  This affects a total of 4 spell levels.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard it will be absorbed.  This spell will only affect up to 7th level spells, but if it tries to absorb a spell that goes over its limit, the spell will fail and the spell deflection will be canceled.  For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection.~
@2087 = ~When I was younger, I used to sing a little song that would make the brothers laugh... how did it go now, I wonder?~

Saving Throw: Neg

The finger of death spell snuffs out the victim's life force.  The caster points his finger at the victim after the incantation is complete and unless he saves vs. spell at -2, death occurs.  A creature successfully saving still receives 2d8 points of damage + 1 per level of the caster.~

CAUTION: Clerics may not use any bladed or sharp piercing or slashing weapons (ie daggers, all variety of swords, arrows, spears, halberds, axes, etc.) If you have gained proficiencies in weapons such as these with your previous class, they will be LOST PERMANENTLY by dual-classing to cleric.

@2097 = ~DRUID: The druid serves the cause of nature and neutrality; the wilderness is the druid's community. Druids use their special powers to protect it and to preserve balance in the world.
CAUTION: Druids can only use daggers, clubs, quarterstaves, spears, slings, and darts. If you have gained proficiencies in weapons other than these with your previous class, they will be LOST PERMANENTLY by dual-classing to druid.~
@2098 = ~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, the wizard studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical research.  A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive.
CAUTION: No matter what class a mage is combined with, they can NEVER cast spells while wearing armor other than elven chainmail.~
@2099 = ~THIEF: To accomplish their goals, for good or ill, thieves are skilled pilferers. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are their hallmarks.
CAUTION: No matter what class a thief is combined with, they can NEVER use their thieving abilities while wearing armor other than leather, studded leather or elven chainmail.

@2103 = ~Confusion (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Chaos
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/ 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed saving throws vs. spell with - 2 penalties.  Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. 

The spell lasts for one round for every two levels of the caster.  Those who fail their saving throws will either go berserk, stand confused or wander about for the duration of the spell.
Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.).  Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~
@2104 = ~I suppose that is true.  Thank you... for everything.~

@2109 = ~Shield of the Archons (Abjuration) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Protection
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed.  This affects a total of spell levels equal to half the level of the priest.  This includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes the following: area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest as well as area effects that are stationary such as cloud kill and stinking cloud.  As long as the spell is cast directly at the priest it will be absorbed.  As long as there are spell levels remaining this will absorb the spell.  For example if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.  This also works against dispel magic.~

Mazzy is a dedicated servant of Arvoreen, the halfling god of war, and she resents the common perception by the bigger races that the stout folk cannot defend themselves or act with valor.

@2181 = ~Burning Hands (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Range: 5 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 60 degree arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. 
~
@2182 = ~Shadow Door (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 5
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell, but without the bonuses to Armor Class and saving throws), for the spell duration. A True Seeing or Detect Invisibility spell, a thief's Detect Illusions ability, or similar means can discover the wizard.
~
@2183 = ~Non-Detection (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Range: Touch 
Duration: 20 turns 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 1 creature or item 
Saving Throw: None 

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature or object touched undetectable by divination spells including Detect Invisibility and True Sight, or a thief's Detect Illusion ability, though for True Sight this is dependent on the type of invisibility, and an invisible person may still be audible when moving. It does not affect the Know Alignment spell.

(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 4

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is much like the 3rd-level monster summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 4 HD monsters. There is a 60% chance of receiving one monster and a 40% chance of receiving two monsters.  These monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires, or until they are slain.~

Level: 1
Range: 0 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level (increasing every 2 levels)
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: caster 
Saving Throw: Special 

A friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 6 points of Charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with the spellcaster and make an effort to be his friends and help him, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking him captive instead.  Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@2187 = ~Sleep (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 1
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 5 rounds/level 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Neg

When a wizard casts a sleep spell, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). All creatures to be affected by the sleep spell must be within 30 feet of each other.  Creatures in the area of effect must make a saving throw at a -3 penalty or fall asleep.   Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice (4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster.  Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses.~
@2188 = ~Agannazar's Scorcher (Evocation) 
Level: 2
Range: 20 yards 
Duration:  Instant
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 2-foot by 60-foot jet. 
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3-18 points of damage.  There is no saving throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as fire resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage. Other creatures who cross the path of the flame jet will also take damage as long as they stand in the flame.
~
@2189 = ~Fireball (Evocation) 
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 3 
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: 1/2 

A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~
@2190 = ~Magic Missile (Evocation) 
Level: 1
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile - he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.~
@2191 = ~Animate Dead (Necromancy) 
Level: 5
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: 8 hours 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates 1-2 undead monsters to rise and serve the wizard under any conditions.  One undead servant automatically rises and there is a 5% chance per level of the caster that another will rise and join the first.  However, at 15th level the caster will be able to summon a Skeleton Warrior (only one), a very powerful ally indeed.
The undead can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat, 8 hours pass, or are turned.  The magic cannot be dispelled.~
@2192 = ~Color Spray (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Range: 30 feet
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 60 degree arc
Saving Throw: Special 

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from his hand. From one to six creatures (1d6) within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard.   All creatures in the area of effect that are 4th level or less must make a saving throw or be rendered unconscious for five rounds.
~
@2193 = ~Protection From Fire (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire) 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

The effects of a protection from fire spell last no longer than three rounds plus one round per caster level.  When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like).  Likewise this spell absorbs 80% of all damage done by magical fires such as fiery dragon breath, spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame strike, meteor swarm, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, etc. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@2194 = ~Remove Curse (Abjuration) 
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection 
Range: Touch 
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 6 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: Special 

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~
@2195 = ~Barkskin (Alteration) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Protection, Plant 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When a priest casts the barkskin spell upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor Class 4 at 8th, and so on. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a + 1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature he touches. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@2196 = ~Resist Fire/Resist Cold (Alteration) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Protection 
Range: Touch 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. Complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as: red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 50%. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~
@2197 = ~Animal Summoning I 
(Conjuration, Summoning) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 20 yards
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 7

Level: 5
Sphere: Animal, Summoning 
Range: 60 yards/level 
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By means of this spell, the caster calls from one to three animals that have 8 Hit Dice or less.  The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until the spell duration expires.

Level: 2
Sphere: All 
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instant 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30' radius

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination 
Range: 10 yards 
Duration: Instant
Casting time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 

A know alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature. The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for a full round. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell at -2, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. Certain magical devices negate the power of the know alignment spell.~
@2201 = ~Alatos~
@2202 = ~Magical Stone (Enchantment) 
Level: 1
Sphere: Combat 
Range: 0 
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By using this spell, the priest can create a small magical pebble, which then flies out and hits a target opponent.  The stone deals 1-4 damage to whomever it hits.  The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus.

@2203 = ~Spiritual Hammer (Invocation) 
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat 
Range: Self 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer.  For the duration of the spell, the Priest may use the magic weapon without non-proficiency penalties.  It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 enchantment level, +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4 + 1 vs. opponents plus the magical bonus).

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic

Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 

When the priest casts a raise dead spell, life can be restored to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, elf, half-orc, tiefling or human. Note that the body of the person must be whole, otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life.  The person has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.~

@2220 = ~History of Calimshan:  

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.  

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire.  Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there.  Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.  

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places - Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr - took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe. 

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change.  As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born.  It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms.  Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn.  The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere. 

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim.   A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen.  Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir). 

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to soley dominate the land.  There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area.  About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land.  Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do.  The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one.  The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~
@2221 = ~History of Cormyr:  

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings.  For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts.  At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne.  King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years - since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders.  However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east.  One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy."  In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap.  Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton.  Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history.  Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin.  When Raurin fell in 2488DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia.  Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged.  Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy.  All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity.  Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life.  Merchants were honored above all.  In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants.  During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries.  War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement.  During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed.  Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath.  The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every ablebodied fighting man they sent.  The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts.  He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time.  He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things.  He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade.  He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems.  He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life.  Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range.  They roamed as far east as Kara Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa.  At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zaakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@2223 = ~History of Halruaa:   

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert.  The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netheril, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe.  It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow.  The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times.  Once, led by a magic resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa.  They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader.  Forty-thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by 500 Halruans.  More than 200 Halruan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle. 

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than 100 years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power hungry king of Lapaliiya.  He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships.  The attackers were easily routed. 

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netheril didn't approve of.  The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa. 

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruans very defensive, warlike and traditional.  The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@2224 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:  

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors.  The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home.  The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below.  The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshall of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days.  Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege.  With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun.  Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people.  Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow.  Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@2225 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale.  All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home.  A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs.  During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll.  Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale.  The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune.  Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~
@2226 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan.  Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people.  It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale.  His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network.  When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule.  Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~
@2227 = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff.  Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large.  This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well.  They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster).  The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~
@2228 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords.  Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area.  The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader.  With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@2229 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates.  They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale.  Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship.  It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well. 

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network.  He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal.  Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people.  The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender.  Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~
@2230 = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area.  A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement.  The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes.  The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~
@2231 = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon.  The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale).  Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym.  The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale.  Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule.  This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~
@2232 = ~History of Shadowdale -  Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped.  The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender.  Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan.  While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR).  When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle.  In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old.  By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community.  Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name.  If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~
@2233 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:  

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands.  Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races.  However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers.  The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep - its slender, now-broken spires - can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby.  This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands.  On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@2234 = ~History of the Dragon Coast:  

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin.  Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall.  It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south.  And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate.  The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords.  His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast - corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR.  Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~
@2235 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:  

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "Elves of the South," before this crucial event.  Even then they were known as "Dark Elves," for the hue of their skins.  They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South.  A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes.  Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered.  This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~
@2236 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants: 

 East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans.  This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance.  In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion.  The powers then dropped a star onto the land.  The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.  

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks.  The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths.  The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again. 

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future.  They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~

He has stormed off to look into the matter, refusing to reward me... I suspect I shall face repercussions from the Cowled Wizards, as well.  I doubt I shall see Valygar again.~
@2391 = ~The hunt for Valygar is over.

I have informed Tolgerias, a Cowled Wizard, of the location of Valygar here in the city.  Despite the fact that I did not bring them the ranger's body, it was good enough for the wizard and I received my reward.  He left immediately... likely to capture the ranger and use him for whatever purposes he had intended.~
@2392 = ~Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills.

I have encountered Madulf and his band.  They have had their own string of deaths, and Madulf is almost as worried as the villagers are.  He doesn't seem to present a threat, and even wanted me to arrange a peace between the village and his band... which, of course, I'm not going to do.  He is still an ogre and cannot be trusted, but it is unlikely that his group is causing the deaths.  Perhaps I should tell the mayor this.~
@2393 = ~Helping Tiris in Trademeet

I spoke to Tiris and found out something startling... Rejiek, the murderer from the Bridge District in Athkatla whom I drove off, is now in Trademeet and apparently working with a strange, skinless creature.  Tiris and his girlfriend, Raissa, were kidnapped and brought to the woods by the southwest gate, where Tiris was just barely able to escape.  He begs that I find Raissa, and suggests that I look in the woods for any clues.~
@2394 = ~Valygar's family quest is over.

Valygar's quest is finally done.  Lavok was not what he expected, and has caused the normally judgmental ranger to think deeply about what he has experienced.  With the necromancer dead and the Cowled Wizards no longer hunting him, Valygar has asked to continue traveling with me.  I have accepted him back into the group.~

@2397 = ~Getting Inside the Asylum

Captain Golin told me that I could get inside Spellhold by convincing a pirate named Desharik that I was insane... he could send me within Spellhold as a patient if he was cared to do so.  Desharik can be found on the far west of the island... if I go there, Golin said to tell the doorman that he sent me.~
@2398 = ~Getting Inside the Asylum

We have arrived on the island safely, and Bodhi has informed me that Saemon will be aiding as a guide of sorts, bringing me to someone who will help me get inside the asylum.  As for Bodhi herself, she has left and said she will meet up with me afterwards.~
@2399 = ~Helping Tiris in Trademeet

I went to the place Tiris described, but met only a man named Darsidian Moor who claimed to be hunting the skinless creature who is with Rejiek.  He calls it a 'Skin Dancer' and believes the creature to be at a walled-off area of the town just north of the east gate, in an orange pavilion... and has left to confront it.  He asks that I meet him there as soon as possible.~
@2400 = ~Helping Tiris in Trademeet

The man I met at the woods, Darsidian Moor, inferred that the skinless creature may have captured Raissa to remove her skin and create another like himself... else it would have consumed her flesh on the spot.  What the creature's connection to Rejiek might be, I have no idea.~

I have defeated the King's monster and he has ordered the opposing priestess sacrificed to Sekolah.  I am now the 'chosen one', the King intends to have me kill the leader of a group of rebels outside of the city and return with his heart... for which he will reward me with great riches.

Short bow staves are about 5 ' feet long on the average.  As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges.  Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length.  The former resulted in what is now called the long bow.

Higgold offered to buy the playhouse from me, but I'd prefer to remain in charge, for now.  You never know when having such a place would come in handy... and it may serve as a creative outlet in the future.  Who knows, though, where my future will take me?  I expect that the theater will draw a regular income, which I should come back to the playhouse from time to time to collect.  No doubt Higgold will store it somewhere inside for me.~
@2475 = ~The de'Arnise Keep has been invaded.

We encountered Daleson in the keep, and he informed us that Nalia's father likely yet lives... but he has been taken captive and brought to the "cellars", the old dungeon within the keep.  It seems he was attempting to gather the heads for a flail, kept separate for reasons Nalia didn't know... but she suggests it might be a good idea to find the pieces if her father didn't.~
@2476 = ~The Juggernaut Golem activated.

The Cowled Wizard Jermien used the mimic's blood I brought him to activate his juggernaut golem... only to have his creation turn on him.  I managed to kill it and save the wizard, for which he was quite thankful.~
@2477 = ~The de'Arnise Keep has been invaded.

We have finally encountered TorGal, the leader of the trolls that have invaded the keep.  He intimated that he and his pack made a deal with some outside force... perhaps to make the attack in the first place and kill the family?  Unfortunately, battle broke out before any more information could be found out.~

@2495 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

I have encountered Valygar Corthala in his cabin in the Umar Hills, hiding from the Cowled Wizards who believe that he will enable them to have access to the planar sphere in the Slums District of Athkatla through his blood relation to Lavok, the necromancer who created it 500 years ago.

Valygar believes that Lavok, himself, is within the sphere... and that he intends to prolong his life through taking the body of a relative as he always has.  Valygar's family has sworn to kill Lavok should he ever reappear, and now this is his chance.

I have agreed to take Valygar with me to Athkatla and enter the sphere and discover what is within... and kill Lavok should we encounter him.~
@2496 = ~Jaheira renounces her Harper status.

We have met with yet another Harper... this one, apparently, a former tutor of Jaheira's by the name of Dermin.  He told Jaheira that he was sent to execute her for the deaths at the Harper Hold, and while he did not attack, Jaheira renounced her life as a Harper.

But as I had urged her on to this path, she felt that I did not trust her judgement any more than the Harpers, and so she has left the group.  I fear she is gone for good.~
@2497 = ~Getting Inside the Asylum

I got into the guildhouse by hiring a courtesan... and upon realizing that I might free Claire, the courtesan was willing enough to tell me that the girl was held at the end of the hall.  The key, however, is likely on Lady Galvena's person or in her room... and the guards certainly won't let me just wander about.~
@2498 = ~Perform Bodhi's tasks to receive her aid.

Bodhi told me much today... but most importantly that she has booked passage to the island asylum where Imoen... and presumably Irenicus... are being held.  I am to return to her as soon as I am ready to leave on the ship.~
@2499 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

I have met Valygar Corthala in his cabin in the Umar Hills, hiding away from the Cowled Wizards who are hunting him.  According to Valygar, he is related to Lavok, an ancient necromancer who built the sphere five hundred years before... a sphere that disappeared shortly after it was completed and has just re-appeared.  The Cowled Wizards seem sure that Valygar is the key to accessing the place, the reason for their harassment of him.

I have let Valygar go his own way, but he cannot stay any longer at the cabin now that it has been compromised.  He told me that if I should have need of him in the future, I can find him through his servant at his home in the Docks District in Athkatla.~

@2587 = ~Another name for natrolite in the Realms; its slender, colorless crystals yield tiny faceted gems used often in veils and robes to capture the effect of beads of water glistening upon the material.~
@2588 = ~Garnet is a general class of crystals ranging from deep red to violet in colour.  A typical cut for this rare isometric gem is 12 to 24 sides, with the very rare 36 sides being known from time to time. It is rumored that a 48-sided garnet exists although none have ever been able to track down its location.~
@2589 = ~Sunstone is a feldspar gem, closely related to moonstone, and more properly known as oligoclase.  Sunstone can be colorless or faintly greenish and of facet grade, but most common by far is its softer (cabochon) variety.  This yields gemstones that have bright red or orange spangles (minute crystals) suspended in a nearly colorless background in a parallel fashion, giving the whole a rich golden or reddish-brown color.~
@2590 = ~Skydrop is the common name given to clear or lightly colored tektite material; fragments of glass of celestial (meteoric) origin, found in the vast shifting sands of Anauroch and other deserts.~

@2593 = ~Iol is actually short for Iolite (cordierite), although a common nickname is "violet stone" even though its overall hue is usually blue. Iols are usually cut into faceted gems to best display the stone's color change as it is viewed from different directions. Small, cut iols can be clear, but larger specimens usually contain silky inclusions of another substance such as hematite crystals, which give the same rich golden flash of color as in sunstones.~
@2594 = ~A protection scroll is a set of magical runes imprinted on enchanted parchment. These scrolls are unique in that any class of character can read them, whether adept in magic or not.

These scrolls can have a wide variety of beneficial effects, though care should be taken with scrolls gained from suspicious sources.~
@2595 = ~Moonbar is a pearly white, opaque gemstone, usually pale blue with green and gold mottling.  Related in type to fire and black opals, but is only slightly more common.~

They are clear, teardrop-shaped, smooth surfaced, and totally unbreakable so far by any means.  These stones are said to be the crystallized tears of long-dead necromancer kings.  In each gem can be seen that which the weeping king loved long ago.  Their true nature is unknown, but it suffices to say that sages prize these gems above all others.~
@2597 = ~A small, shifting, rainbow coloured, iridescent gemstone.  The fluid shades of colour appear almost liquid under normal sunlight, it is truly a beautiful sight to behold.

Level: 9
Range:  Touch 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

When the Imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth.  The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast.  Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists, rather a horrible fate, actually.  If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing.  Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner.  There is no saving throw, and the target's magic resistance is ignored.~

Jaheira's steadfast belief in her cause appears to have won the day.  The Harpers have judged the matter closed and will not pursue me further... and on top of this, Jaheira has been given a Harper Pin, an honor that not all Harpers can claim.

@2995 = ~Gray? Gray is not a color, it is the blurring of another. Gray is indecision, and I have no time for it.~
@2996 = ~You... don't seem like any creature I've encountered before.~
@2997 = ~It was quite silly... it was obvious that whatever the gnome was trying to do wasn't working.~
@2998 = ~... I think I passed out.  When I woke up, I had been turned into this... into this... monstrosity!~
@2999 = ~I... I don't know what to do!  My son didn't come into the tent with me and I'm frightened to think what may have happened to him!~

@3004 = ~The hunt for Valygar Corthala.

Hervo mentioned that Valygar had numerous friends in the Amnish military, as he was a scout for them at one point.  He remembered one friend in particular... a woman by the name of Suna Seni.  This is the same woman who sought me out recently with a group of thugs... although Hervo doesn't seem to think this is connected to Valygar, I am not so sure.~
@3005 = ~A well thought and calculated plan, though I do not recall you being so cold. Perhaps I have had some memory loss myself.~
@3006 = ~Forgive me the curiosity, but you are quite alien to me.  You are not of this place, and do not fit into the natural order, at least not by design.~
@3007 = ~Or perhaps you enjoy the discord of chaos because you have not found that niche as yet.  We shall see.~
@3008 = ~Ahh, you have quite the way of inspiring comrades.  Certainly such an act would let you sleep soundly at night.  Your 'friends' will... watch over you intently.~
@3009 = ~Ooo, such delicious fire, though better it was turned on an enemy.  I would be your ally, Jaheira; your strength might even bring you respect among my kind.~
@3010 = ~I am not to be swayed by your words, creature.  I know too much of you and your kind.~
@3011 = ~Do you wish me dour and sour like most others?  No, I say not.  The animals run and play without care, and I would too... if such a thing would not squish Boo flat.~
@3012 = ~Eh, well... no... but it sounds sharp and painful and I always reserve such things for freaks that might steal those squirrels' nuts!~
@3013 = ~Unnatural... yes.  I struggle to understand the differences in magic that have been presented to me.  How do you feel about it, Jaheira?  Are they not all cut of the same vile shroud?~ [VALYGA62]
@3014 = ~Er, yes, whatever you wish.~
@3015 = ~You look quite interested in the local flora, Jan.~ [JAHEIR50]
@3016 = ~Oh, yes indeed. It reminds me of my cousin, Tyllie Fleetknees, and the garden she had at the foot of a dryad tree in the Forest of Wyrms. I tell you, she went up expecting well-aerated soil, yet did she get a surprise? Oh yes indeed! Why, I remember it like it was burned into my memory with a flaming stick, which was very close to the truth actually...~ [JANJAN61]
@3017 = ~Er... yes?~
@3018 = ~Ahh... of course.~
@3019 = ~Hahaha... you're not what? You're not my beast? Oh, but you are, all of you are, don't you see?~ [KALAH08]
@3020 = ~Well done, my friend! Truly, I doubted that you would survive to meet me. Welcome to my domain. I regret that my hospitality will result in your deaths.~ [KALAH03]
@3021 = ~Little Aerie, is that you? I have no eyes, no eyes!~
@3022 = ~You there!  I am not what I seem to be!  It is I... Quayle.~
@3023 = ~I will yell if I wish, and I will make damn sure our enemies here me! We must hurry and find... we...~
@3024 = ~I will not! If you do not care enough to hurry then perhaps another should lead! Someone that will make sure our fallen are avenged! Someone who... who...~
@3025 = ~We must gather ourselves and what equipment we can for the war to come. We must be ready to avenge... and fight...~
@3026 = ~I... I am sorry, I have been thinking too much of... of Khalid. I was in shock before, but...~
@3027 = ~We will have revenge for all wrongs in time.~
@3028 = ~I... I agree, though I shall try not to be fixated on such things. All will be dealt with in time. I will see to it.~
@3029 = ~I will not forget just like that. I will... bide my time. In the end we will deal justice to those that deserve it. Patience is all it will take.~
@3030 = ~Yes, in time. I will try to maintain my composure through this.~
@3031 = ~Nnn... no!~ [JAHEIR70]
@3032 = ~Nnn... No! NO!! Wh... what?~
@3033 = ~Restless dreams. I have them myself on occasion.~
@3034 = ~N-no, there is something very wrong.  More and more I feel Khalid's absence.  I... I thought myself stronger than this.~
@3035 = ~I... I was.  I stood beside Khalid in a battle long since won, only this time, he did not survive. There was... nothing I could do.~

@3039 = ~Wherever the trail of gold leads us. I lost much in my capture, and I will not leave poor.~
@3040 = ~Moral, most definitely.  I must watch the overall balance of things, and you may figure largely in the tipping.  It is because of... what you are.~
@3041 = ~Who will judge what path is right for me?~
@3042 = ~I enjoy matching wits with cretins like these.~

@3045 = ~Perhaps an inn. I guess it doesn't really matter, does it?~
@3046 = ~I'm... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I do not wish to cause undue strain in our party. I am merely a bit stressed, and no doubt you are as well.~
@3047 = ~Stow it, Jaheira.~
@3048 = ~Yes, but not acceptable. We are friends, and should act as such. I... I apologize.~
@3049 = ~Agreed, though we have all suffered much and the mood may change. I will try to be civil by your side.~
@3050 = ~Mmmph... no... no... NO!!  Wh-what... what?~ [JAHEIR76]
@3051 = ~Nnn... no... NO!! wh... wh... what?~
@3052 = ~Jaheira, you scared the hell out of me. I thought we were under attack.~
@3053 = ~No, there is something very wrong. I... I have been having nightmares, and when I wake, it is still there. Khalid... I thought I was stronger than this.~
@3054 = ~None of us can affect the past, Jaheira.~
@3055 = ~You are harsh and cruel, but it seems to serve you well. Perhaps that is the answer. I... I don't know. I will not bother you again with this.~
@3056 = ~Yes, well, we should be going. I am fine now. Thank you.~
@3057 = ~Hmm... seems I cannot help but speak of the dead lately. I did not wish to cause you any distress if I have.~
@3058 = ~I... I see. That attitude will not make you popular among the living that do remember. The dead leave their tendrils behind, for good or bad.~
@3059 = ~This I know all too well.~
@3060 = ~I think you are right. It is a shame when the dead take the living with them.~
@3061 = ~Yes. His story became yours, and you took it with you. You are not of his blood, but there is much of him in you.~
@3062 = ~True... true enough. You are wise to see as such.~
@3063 = ~Well... enough of this for now. Talk such as this can get maudlin if indulged too often. I have a... a good feeling from this though.~
@3064 = ~Yes, he sheltered you carefully from those that would harm you. Khalid was the same way, always taking the cautious path.~
@3065 = ~Yes, and they are missed.~
@3066 = ~Thank you for that grasp of the obvious.~
@3067 = ~Nothing of the sort, but I am interested in how you fare against your own instincts.~
@3068 = ~Do you think my struggle different than any other person's?~
@3069 = ~'The present will pass by if you live in the past.  Neither should you wait too long for the future to find you.'   Who said this?  It was... Khalid.~
@3070 = ~Now look, foolish things in my head. Still, these talks always make me feel... better.~
@3071 = ~Mmmph... Khal... No... Khal.. NO! I...~ [JAHEIR78]
@3072 = ~I... I am not so bad.  This one was not so cruel as the others.  Khalid was in the distance, but he would not come closer, and I could not see the way to him.~
@3073 = ~He walked with us, from a distance. He smiled that I was content. I guess... I guess I was.~
@3074 = ~Then we can finally be rid of his specter then? I was getting tired of you constantly depressing me.~
@3075 = ~It... it was not a group. Just... it was just you and I... and I think you are right.~
@3076 = ~Well... um... shall we be off. It is already late in the day. Plenty to do.~
@3077 = ~This is quite cruel of you. So be it, I will not endeavor to speak to you of such things again. It is a waste of... of... Let's just get out of here.~
@3078 = ~Pssst... psssst. Hey. Hey there.~
@3079 = ~RISE AND SHINE! Oh, I hope I didn't disturb ye. My, but yer a bunch of sound sleepers. Did'nay hear the approach of us wee little bandits and now look at the mess yer in.~

@3081 = ~An honorable what? Bandit? Do ye have a clue what will be happening here, buddy boy? We're here to steal ye blind, and ye wish me to do that 'honorably?' Fine. Hand over yer valuables... SIR!~
@3082 = ~Yes, lets do just that. I'll start. Ye'll be handing over what valuables ye have -and we've heard ye have a lot- and then we'll be going on our way.~
@3083 = ~We get what we want and ye get... well, perhaps we just get what we want. That's good enough for me.~
@3084 = ~Riddle of the Imps

There was some kind of specter in the chest that held the drow treasure, which killed the opener rather viciously before fleeing.  Perhaps I should have played the imps' game when they offered it.~
@3085 = ~Well, yer certainly being reasonable about all of this. Mind you, I'll just keep a grip on the lassie here until my boys have finished their work. Stand still, will you?~
@3086 = ~Hush now, lassie. Yes, I stand before ye a liar.  Go figure.  Now we'll just finish ye and... hold still ye... OW!! Me hand!~
@3087 = ~Oh, for shame. That was simply a mistake, especially for the little lassie. Oops, there goes my shaky wrist. Aw, that has got to sting.~
@3088 = ~Eughh, should I let ye polish me boots while you're down on your knees? Ye have the spine of a noble, that is for certain. What the... hold still, lassie!~

@3104 = ~Ahhh... nothing.  Nothing at all...~
@3105 = ~Bodhi keeps her side of the bargain.

Bodhi agreed to fulfill our bargain, though there were some additional concerns she revealed.
According to Bodhi, Irenicus captured me because he had discovered my nature as a child of Bhaal, and he was attempting to 'aid' my development, though his methods were indistinguishable from torture. The Shadow Thieves attacked Irenicus before I could be told any of this, and I escaped as he was incarcerated.

Bodhi also told me that she is essentially Irenicus' sister, and that her reason for helping me is that she wishes to free the wizard from the same place that Imoen has been sent to, a dread asylum for magic-users called Spellhold. Bodhi does this not out of any familial attachment, but rather because she requires Irenicus for her own purposes. As added incentive she offers to reveal whatever Irenicus learned about me. 

The asylum is on an island under its own rule, and Bodhi used the gold I gave her to book passage for me.  There I will try to find a way into Spellhold to free Imoen... and, Bodhi hopes, free Irenicus at the same time.~

@3187 = ~Large Shield +2:
This dwarven-made shield was commissioned by Pellan of Tyr, a brash paladin known for unquestioning courage and an almost total lack of common sense.  Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle.  As it happened, Pellan and his armor digested readily enough, but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps.  Subsequently coughed up, it lay in a hoard for years until retrieved by Pellan's son, a warrior who knew when to sneak. 
Superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to wield.

@3190 = ~A large shield inlaid with a golden griffin.  This shield, also known as the kite or tower shield, is a massive metal shield reaching nearly from the chin to the toe of the user.  It must be firmly fastened to the forearm and the shield hand must firmly grip it at all times.  Naturally, this precludes use of the shield hand for anything but holding the body shield in place.  Strangely enough, this shield feels unusually light for its size.

This is the morningstar of Kiel the Legion-Killer, first-born son of Durlag Trollkiller and Clan-prince of his father's ill-fated tower. He was wielding it in his final hour as he rushed to warn his father of the doppelgangers' infiltration of their Clan-home. It is said that the intensity of his rage in these final moments permanently imprinted itself upon the weapon. All who wield it are overcome with this battle anger whenever an enemy is sighted.

@3254 = ~Er... sure.  Can you tell me where I might find Mae'Var?~
@3255 = ~Er... no, no.  Of course not.  Just tryin' to inform ya of the ranks, is all.~
@3256 = ~I'm Zyntris.  Just so you're aware, I'm the senior cutpurse around here, right?  Get too big for yer britches and I stick ya... got it?~

@3258 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>... pleased to meet you.~
@3259 = ~Well, just go down those stairs over there and you'll find Mae'Var engaged in the business of information extraction.  Forcible extraction, that is.~
@3260 = ~Er... thanks.  I'll be on my way.~

@3262 = ~Uh... could you direct me to Mae'Var?~
@3263 = ~Er... could you direct me to Mae'Var, perhaps?~
@3264 = ~Well, I am very pleased to meet you, <CHARNAME>.  There truly aren't enough fellow sisters in the Shadow Thieves... although we are amongst the very best, aren't we?~
@3265 = ~Mae'Var says that you are to be our newest member.  How delightful to see a new face for one... Lin's did tire me so dreadfully.  I am Anishai, and I am most pleased to meet you.~
@3266 = ~I truly believe that Mae'Var has become a bit too big for himself.  How very sad... I suppose it is only a matter of time, now.~
@3267 = ~I wouldn't be crossing Edwin, if I were ye... I've heard some pretty nasty things about him since he arrived from the north.~

@3270 = ~The One God has demanded that his disciples achieve a higher state of wisdom... you must remove that which is limiting and offensive.~

@3272 = ~Alright... so how does one become a servant?~
@3273 = ~I say yes. I never liked serving those fools anyway. I will enjoy their destruction..~
@3274 = ~What is this item you speak of... and where would I locate it?~
@3275 = ~You have... changed your mind, faithless one?  Have you decided to enter the holy fold of the Unseeing Eye?~ [GAAL25]
@3276 = ~The item is a rod... or part of a rod, rather, that you will find atop a holy altar.  I cannot tell you more than that.  You must let your faith guide you.~
@3277 = ~And you will help me find Imoen for 15,000? I still wonder why you would do this.~
@3278 = ~I have a key I can give you... this will allow you entrance to the inner chambers through a door a short distance back the way you came, at the sewer passages.~
@3279 = ~You are certainly somewhat braver than the cattle inside. You leave the safety of the palisade with a confident stride and a dangerous look about you. Those fools within are frightened of their own shadows.~
@3280 = ~Uhhhh... okay...~
@3281 = ~No... but I have decided to end your worthless life!~
@3282 = ~There is no such thing as 'safe risk.' Are your tasks for the thieves full of 'safe risk?' I doubt it very much so. I offer an alternative risk, nothing more.~
@3283 = ~Perhaps they would, but they are not here. I am not without my defenses. I would not ask you here if I thought you were a threat.~
@3284 = ~Such confidence is admirable. Very well, this place is now open to you. It is a safe haven, and below there are friends of mine that will tend to your trading needs.~ [BODHIX16]
@3285 = ~I will side with you, Mistress, and may the gods have mercy on our enemies.~
@3286 = ~That is... unfortunate. Very well, you may go.~
@3287 = ~Hmm... be wary, my friends!  Someone has come before us, I can sense it!~ [SASSAR02]
@3288 = ~I wish a campaign of disruption, and you will begin it. There is a shipment of supplies arriving by boat. You are to... confiscate it.~ [BODHIX18]
@3289 = ~But how am I to be of use if I am revealed as an enemy?~
@3290 = ~There will be other things for you to do in time. These little chores are only the preliminary. I will speak of others later.~
@3291 = ~Valen said something about a business opportunity?~
@3292 = ~What would you have of me in this place?~
@3293 = ~Reasons don't matter to the dead.~
@3294 = ~Yes, I was to offer a... relationship... to oppose your current employers, but I do not think it will be available to you after all..~
@3295 = ~By the gods! Haven't we paid off enough of the council to not have you idiot Amnish soldiers barge in here every time you feel like filling your arrest quotas?~
@3296 = ~This is the buckler of Kiel the Legion-Killer, first-born son of Durlag Trollkiller and Clan-prince of his father's ill-fated tower. Its light weight and excellent craftsmanship increase the dexterity of all who bear it by a single point.

@3298 = ~Bala's Axe - Wizard Slayer:
Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it.

@3353 = ~Polymorph Other (Alteration) 
Level: 4
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected.  Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form.  However most physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form.  This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully.  The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature.  All clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~
@3354 = ~You will surely pay for your insolence, fool... in the next life if not in this one.~

@3359 = ~Polymorph Self (Alteration) 
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4 
Area of Effect: self
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature.  The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well.  This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes.  The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others.  The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form.  Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistances to magic, missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime form.

The possible forms given by polymorph self are:
(1) Gnoll: wields a magical halberd (+1 fire damage and strikes as an enchanted weapon +3)
(2) Mustard Jelly: capable of slowing opponents (if they fail Save vs. Spells when hit).
(3) Ogre: capable of causing massive damage with its fists
(4) Spider: causes poison damage when it hits an opponent

In addition the caster may choose the form of brown bear, black bear or wolf.~

@3364 = ~Oh, pardon me, friend... I think you dropped something here...~
@3365 = ~Er... no, no of course not.  Oh, look up there!  What is that?!~
@3366 = ~I say... you're being rather rude with that accusing glare of yours.  I am but an innocent gnome!~
@3367 = ~Be careful to hold onto yer gold, my <LADYLORD>... there not be a single guard in this part of town to cry out for if ye loses it.~
@3368 = ~Well, now, I thought that the Docks be gettin' bad, but with one o' the black harlots showin' her face, here... now I knows it's far worse.~
@3369 = ~My husband has mentioned the thief master Mae'Var many times... he be a cruel and wicked lout, he is.~
@3370 = ~Careful, now... there's some mighty queer people roamin' the Docks, there is.  You must always be on yer guard.~
@3371 = ~Aye, now... weren't ye just selling turnips but a few weeks past, gnome?  I'm sure I've seen ye.~
@3372 = ~Naturally it was me, my dear.  The selling of turnips is a fine and time-honored profession that I am sad to say I have left behind me for the moment.  One can only do one thing at a time... unless, of course, you want to talk about my cousin Abraham.~
@3373 = ~You're speaking of me, you insolent woman!  Watch your tongue, or I'll scorch it off for you!  (Miserable peasants... the common Thayvian wouldn't speak like this!)~
@3374 = ~You should beware... this part of town belongs to the Bloodscalp, the leader of the Shadow Thieves!~
@3375 = ~There be a nobleman that's been down by the docks for some time... truly, 'tis a wonder that he has not been robbed as of yet!~
@3376 = ~By Helm... I mean no offense, miss, but might I say that yer the prettiest sight I've seen in a long time.~
@3377 = ~Thank you... I suppose.  That's very kind of you to say.~
@3378 = ~You want t' see the head o' the Docks, you speaks to the Bloodscalp.  He rules the Shadow Thieves, he does... and the Docks.  Ye'll see none o' the guards, here.~
@3379 = ~The weather has been so terrible... I expect the gods have been frownin' on us, they have.~
@3380 = ~Ay, now... you looks like a minstrel, you does.  Will you be playin' a tune for us, mayhap?~
@3381 = ~Nothing would please me more, good sir... but perhaps another time.~
@3382 = ~Might ye wish to take a look at some wares o' mine?  I can offer them at a mighty fine price... come, take a look.~
@3383 = ~I would not run about threatenin' the locals... there be no guards here to save ye.  But I'll do as ye say... for now.~
@3384 = ~Ye should be wary who ye threaten!  Come, boys... we have trouble here!~
@3385 = ~Good business to you, my <LADYLORD>... Ikert bids you welcome to my humble establishment.  You are new to the Docks, yes?  Might I ask your name?~
@3386 = ~Certainly... let's see what you have.~

@3391 = ~Some monsters are immune or resistant to magic.~
@3392 = ~You can't be too careful around here... there's no guards to protect us little folk from the ruffians!~
@3393 = ~You have to stay away from the Shadow Thief buildings... they don't like prying eyes, you know.~
@3394 = ~Gosh... I sure don't like it around here.  I wish I could go back to the burrows one day.~
@3395 = ~You don't?  Er... could you give me some, anyway?  I'm awfully short.~
@3396 = ~Er... as much as you want to pay me?  I'm open to anything.~
@3397 = ~Hmmm... you have the stench of a welcher.~
@3398 = ~At least you've rid me of a potential risk... and I can deny involvement because none of my men did the task. Still very sloppy, I expected better of you.~
@3399 = ~I'll not convert to Cyric's worship... or do anything else you ask.~

@3401 = ~Athkatla is the finest port south of Waterdeep... excellent trading, here.~

@3404 = ~OooOOooh... only one day's shore leave an' I can barely see straight...~
@3405 = ~Well, if that don't take all.  The thieves have finally stolen me fishing boat.  What in blazes am I supposed to do now?~
@3406 = ~Talk amongst the fishermen is that ye have t' talk to Renal the Bloodscalp if ye wants to talk to the Shadow Thieves.  Better than talkin' to Mae'Var... he's a frightening one, he is.~
@3407 = ~Saw the nobleman... what was 'is name?... Xzar?  I think that be it.  He was down by the docks last I saw him, looking to employ people like yourselves.~
@3408 = ~Yes?  Is there someth... Renfeld!  By Tymora!  Thank you for bringing him to us, we were beginning to worry!~
@3409 = ~Xzar...?  It's me, <CHARNAME>... don't you recognize me?~
@3410 = ~I saw you dealing with those Harpers ... but it is obvious you are not a Harper yourself.  You would be willing,  then, to render me a service regarding them.~
@3411 = ~Tell me... who are you?  What manner of place is this?~
@3412 = ~Well!  I see there is no one with sufficient courage to take on even the most noble of tasks!  Not even to save the life of a poor soul in dire jeopardy!~
@3413 = ~(sigh)  Very well... exactly what is it that you want, then?~
@3414 = ~Bah!  To deal with gutless, whining whelps is excruciating!   When you gather enough courage to take up my offer, I shall be here.~
@3415 = ~Excellent.  Go to their building and return once you have found him.  Short... halfling... thief... even one of your intellectual capacity can't miss him.~
@3416 = ~I know certain information... the mage who captured you, Irenicus; I know where he is.  Do my task and I shall tell you... heh, heh.~
@3417 = ~I'm willing to do the job... what was it again that you wanted me to do?~
@3418 = ~Yes, actually.  Montaron was turned into a bird and put in the Harper's aviary... but I don't have it with me.~
@3419 = ~I have found out what happened to him, yes.  He was turned into a bird... which I have with me, here.~
@3420 = ~That's right... find someone else to do your work for you.  I tire of your attitude.~
@3421 = ~Well, what are you waiting for?!  Go and get that bird and bring it back to me?  Bah... do I have to tell you everything?!~
@3422 = ~That wasn't part of the deal... I found out what happened and I told you.~
@3423 = ~Very well... I'll go and return with the bird.~
@3424 = ~Finally Montaron will be returned to my side!  This is excellent news... especially since some fools broke into my laboratory and slaughtered all my creations!~
@3425 = ~Then get moving.  Bah!  The amount of incompetence I am forced to deal with on a regular basis astounds me!~
@3426 = ~You try my patience... but I will go and return with the bird.~
@3427 = ~Forget it... get somebody else to get the bird.~
@3428 = ~(sigh)  Sometimes, attempting to speak to you is about as productive as whipping a malnourished and diseased dog... and almost as interesting.~
@3429 = ~Feeblemind (Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg

Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate into that of a simple beast of burden, an Intelligence of 3.  The subject remains in this state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon him.  The victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@3430 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of caster 
Duration: 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 5 
Area of Effect: 5 foot radius around target
Saving Throw: Neg. 

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for nine or more rounds, unless a save vs. spells is made with a -2 penalty.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster.  Any enemies within 5 feet of the target are also affected.  Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. 
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech.  Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

@3435 = ~Sorry, darlin'... ye're lookin' in the wrong part o' town.  Try the Copper Coronet... they might haves somethin' for ye.~
@3436 = ~Hmmm... you seen some sailors around here, aye?~
@3437 = ~Mmmm, now ye there in the robes... ye looks like a fine man.  Care t' barter, aye?~
@3438 = ~It is tempting, lovely one... but I think not.~
@3439 = ~Fetch me... the golden statuette acquired by the church. We need a centerpiece for the guild table. I care not how you get it, just keep the profile low.~
@3440 = ~I require... the amulet worn by the Weathermistress. Yes, it looked lovely on her, and I've a beautiful sheltie-spaniel cross that it will adorn just as well.~
@3441 = ~You need not kill her to get it. She likely removes it in the night. As pleasing as it is, it would leave a welt the size of a melon if slept upon.~
@3442 = ~Hello, there, my dear.  My name is Altheia... is there something that you wanted?~
@3443 = ~I thank you for your compliment.  You are quite kind.  I... I have changed my mind, however.  Perhaps it is best if you found someone else.~
@3444 = ~But I want you... I can afford more money, if that's what you're wondering.~
@3445 = ~You seem to be a woman of class.  How is it that you came into this life on the streets?~
@3446 = ~I have heard rumors of thieves everywhere here in the Docks... what do you know about that?~
@3447 = ~Oh.  Of... of course, my <LADYLORD>.  As you wish.~
@3448 = ~No... it is just... I have never... (sob) done this before!  I am so ashamed... but my father is dead and mother cannot feed us!  I... I have to do something!  (sob!)~
@3449 = ~Well, take my money, then... and let's get better acquainted, if you know what I mean.~
@3450 = ~Is it... that obvious?  (sob!)  ... I have never... (sob!) done this before!  I am so ashamed... but father is dead and mother cannot feed us!  I... I have to do something!  (sob!)~
@3451 = ~Here, then, child... take this 50 gold pieces.  I can afford it, and I trust it will tide you over a short while?~
@3452 = ~I have money, my dear.  Take some of it and perhaps we'll... get better acquainted, yes?~
@3453 = ~I know little about the thieves, my <LADYLORD>.  They be all over the district... and the other women say you must never work for Mae'Var if you value your skin.~
@3454 = ~You seem a woman of class, Altheia... how is it that you came to this life on the streets?~
@3455 = ~I... I cannot!  (sob!)  I cannot, sir!  Forgive me, mother!~
@3456 = ~It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade, instead of performing as one might think a vampiric blade would, was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that could eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent its removal, and the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. This may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking, and one might better spend ones time having a lovely beverage, rather than gallivanting about the wilderness with a pack full of rubbish -chasing phantoms.

@3461 = ~Ehh, kind of gaudy, isn't it? Can't see what's so compelling about it. I'll toss it in with the garbage going to Waterdeep. Lots of dainty collectors up there.~
@3462 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different parts of Faerun.  Whereas the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence.  The "shamshir", as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids.

Club +1, +3 vs. unnatural creatures
This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

(Enchantment/Charm) 
Level: 4
Sphere: Law
Range: Caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None

Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enchanted coordination of their attacks and defenses.  This allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter.  The effect is always centered on the caster, but affects all those within a 10 foot radius.  The affected can move outside of this after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of the harmony.  While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +2 bonus to his armor class.  This lasts for 6 rounds or until successfully dispelled. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.~

@3490 = ~There is nothing else I can do... sorry.  If you change your mind, you know where to find me.  And remember... say nothing or you will suffer the consequences.~
@3491 = ~The Final Battle with Bodhi.

While I had feared for some time that Bodhi's final revenge on me would be to take away Jaheira forever, it seems that the information in the lorebook was right... Amaunator's idol has restored Jaheira not only to life, but has removed the vampiric curse from her, as well.~
@3492 = ~The return to Harper Hold.

I have rejoined with Jaheira at the Harper Hold... and she was happy to see me, relaying that the Harpers there were no longer truly Harpers.  She is unaware of the full plot, but the lack of the specters on the second floor meant that this was a mere splinter group bent on revenge, and having killed them to free Jaheira from their clutches does not weigh on my heart.~

@3513 = ~Very well... I will talk to Sassar again about it.~
@3514 = ~I don't know... perhaps.~
@3515 = ~I am an old and proud dwarf, me friend, and I beg of ye to help us stop the beholder!  I have no eyes yet I will fight to me last breath to kill it!  Please...~
@3516 = ~Oh, please help us!  You are the only one we can turn to... the only one the entire city can turn to!  You would save so many!  Ooooh!~
@3517 = ~You... you would turn us away?  But how will we ever get the rod?  Oh, the beholder will come, first, for it, I just know he will!~
@3518 = ~I am Zaelas, and I have been assisting Sassar in researching the rod below... I truly thank you for helping us!~
@3519 = ~As they take flight from the law, so we have given flight but nowhere to flee. A gilded cage for a form free to soar, that they might know loss in confinement.~
@3520 = ~Bow down to the Unseeing Eye... quake before his holy gaze!~
@3521 = ~I... am but a worshipper of the Unseeing Eye, on a task for Gaal.~
@3522 = ~I... am your death!  I can take no more of this!~
@3523 = ~Yes, Gaal has mentioned you.  You would be better served to cast aside those evil orbs of yours, however.  But Gaal has spoken... move along.~
@3524 = ~Er... indeed.  And the blindness is most holy.  Move along, pilgrim.~
@3525 = ~Many have gone to the lower places and attempted to retrieve the Holy Artifact for the Unseeing Eye... but they were found to be unfaithful.  I hope I am selected next!  I will not fail my God!~
@3526 = ~The faithless who cannot endure the removal of their eyes are thrown into the Pit of the Faithless... there, the demons consume them and they writhe in pain forever!~
@3527 = ~I... my eyes... they hurt...~
@3528 = ~I... my eyes... the pain...~
@3529 = ~Er... nothing, thank you.~
@3530 = ~You... Sassar sent you?  Oh, thank the gods, I am relieved he is still alive!  I am Tad... what do you need me to do?~
@3531 = ~I don't know exactly where the passage is.  Be wary of the creatures who feed upon the bodies of the faithless that are thrown down there.~
@3532 = ~You want me... to go down there?  That is not much of a plan.~
@3533 = ~I see... I'll be on my way, then.~
@3534 = ~It should be safe, my <LADYLORD>... unless the Unseeing Eye is currently within.  He plans a great mass, soon, so if you hurry you should be safe...~
@3535 = ~I... see.  And you want me to go down into that pit?  That's not much of a plan.~
@3536 = ~It is the only way.  I do not know if Sassar has found any other way to combat the beholder... but I doubt it.  I wish you good luck, my friend.~
@3537 = ~Forget it... there's no way I'm going down there.~
@3538 = ~There is no membership to seek, there is only your own path to follow. Harpers seek out their own in time.~
@3539 = ~You bear the mark of one and the same. Here you are welcome and may rest in safety.~
@3540 = ~I... I cannot!  The meat callsss to me!~
@3541 = ~... n-no... I will resissst the sssmell!  Ssstand away, pleassse!~
@3542 = ~We... we triesss to be good... we triesss to be human...~
@3543 = ~They mayor leadsss usss... he tellsss usss to be ssscivilized...~
@3544 = ~... no, no!  The sssmell!  I cannot resissst!!~
@3545 = ~Oh Boo, I can never return to Rashemen!  I am proven unworthy!  I am no man and you are no hamster... we are lost!  Oh the sorrow!!!~
@3546 = ~I have had friends with such attachments before, but never have I met someone so... absorbed in the relationship.  Still, you seem all the better for it.~
@3547 = ~Boo is small, but is more than people believe.  Evil will see you the same as Boo, and that will help you.  You will make a fine Paladin, and I am proud to fight alongside.~
@3548 = ~You have descended to the depths of evil while I watched, and I am at fault for letting it get so far! With our ties severed, I will be free to exact the proper justice!  Boo will have your eyes when next we meet!~ [MINSC89]
@3549 = ~... Sorry, Berinvar is giving me a rather nasty look. I'd better let you get on your way.~
@3550 = ~Sure, I don't see why no... err... actually that probably wouldn't be a good idea. It wouldn't be safe for you because... you're not recognized as a Harper.~
@3551 = ~Oh, we're quite good at thinking on our feet. Usually we set up, do the job and move on before anyone knows it. We would have done that here but... ehh...~
@3552 = ~Dealing with the Trademeet Genies.

The Shadow Thieves in Trademeet want the genies gone as well... bad for business.  Itona said that Ihtafeer has likely replaced an old potion seller named Adratha who lives in a hut to the northeast of the druid grove.  If I eliminate the rakshasi, they will consider us even.~
@3553 = ~Good talking to you. Be... be careful, friend.~
@3554 = ~Chapter 3

Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source.  This other source approached me in the form of Bodhi... a woman of great power and evil, rivaling her ambition.  She revealed the nature of my benefactors under Gaelan Bayle to be none other than the Shadow Thieves, themselves, and offered to give me the same help that they did... but at a far lesser price.

I have accepted Bodhi's offer and she has taken me into her confidence, for now.  The true nature of her motivations has yet to be revealed, but it is obvious that Bodhi is on the winning side of this city-wide conflict.  As to the gold I have given her for her aid... I have the feeling that it is just the beginning of the final price I will eventually have to pay.  But I will have my answers... I will find Imoen and Irenicus both.~
@3555 = ~Recognized? You mean the amulets you seem to all be wearing?~
@3556 = ~What... yes... yes, these are the symbols that show we are Harpers. Ehh, one second.~
@3557 = ~Well, under certain circumstances we... uh... oh, look, Berinvar wants to speak with you. I'd better let you get going.~
@3558 = ~And death will come on wings of song,
A song of long and winding guile,
And in the end your end I wend,
And in the end, a harp will smile!~
@3559 = ~I have no quarrel with you. We made the path difficult, but not unknowable, and in the end this fool did perish, as well he should.~
@3560 = ~The scimitar, or "shamshir" as it was originally called, has a single-edged blade with a significant curve, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point.  It is perhaps slower than other weapons of the same type, though it compensates by the amount of damage it is capable of.  This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to compliment the skill of the wielder.

@3561 = ~A necromancer in the service of the Zhentarim, creating abominations for sale to the highest bidder. Far from their normal range, but not an unexpected enemy.~
@3562 = ~He could not lay low with such a flamboyant manner, and we knew of him quickly. You merely helped in the inevitable, and so you are free.~
@3563 = ~Only her presence kept you alive to question me. No doubt Jaheira would have tried the killing strike herself when you first met Xzar, but duty forbade it.~

@3567 = ~You... wantsss to sssee the Great Feeder?~
@3568 = ~The de'Arnise Keep has been invaded.

Even though Nalia is dead, I've agreed to assist Captain Arat in retaking the keep.  A secret entrance lies north of the palisade in the castle wall, and I should go within and find word of Lord de'Arnise or Lady Delcia and return.  There are apparently yuan-ti and trolls within, and the trolls can only be permanently killed with fire or acid.~
@3569 = ~The... Great Feeder?  If you're referring to the one who throws you down all the dead bodies then, yes, I suppose so.~
@3570 = ~I... I am the mayor of thisss town.  Theshal isss my name.  We havesss built it and we triesss to be good... triesss to be ssscivilized...~

@3573 = ~We isss fed from the hole... they throwsss the meat to usss.  We mussst eat!  But we triesss not to eatsss the living!  I triesss to teach the ghoulsss to be good, to have town likesss the living!~

I have found Solaufein at his quarters and battled him.  I only need take his piwafwi cloak and return to Phaere's apartment.~
@3581 = ~Inside the Drow City

I have talked Solaufein into giving me his piwafwi cloak.  With luck, he will not betray me and Phaere will never know the difference.  It doesn't seem like he will... from the sounds of it, Solaufein is unlike other drow, and actually expressed disgust with their ways.  Perhaps he and I shall meet again.~
@3582 = ~Well, call me an idjit but I always thought I had meself a tavern here.  Got some rooms upstairs if ye need.  Beats sleepin' it off in the street.~
@3583 = ~Ye have proven... to be not worth me time, so I'm saying so long with a smile. Mayhap we meet again, though a blade'll be me handshake! Good riddance!~ [KORGAN88]

@3585 = ~The Recipes and Ruminations of One Dradeel of Tethir

Formerly

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim. 
-----------------
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour, 
The eggs of a seabird, 
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening, 
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising. 
Bake in a well stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor. 
-----------------
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not reccomended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherese Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.
-----------------
Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy. 
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely know vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him. 

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolven clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.
-----------------
The Bachelor's Crutch
Noodles of quality and convenience.

Ingredients:
A measure of noodles.
Boiling water
Container

Combine ingredients in container.
Enjoy. Oh yes, enjoy.

Notes to myself: Should probably be supplemented with something of nutritional value, lest my bones become brittle as chalk. Perhaps the container?~
@3586 = ~Inside the Drow City

Phaere demands that I hunt down Solaufein and kill him.  He will be within his quarters in the Male Fighter's Society, and once the deed is done I am to return to Phaere's quarters with his piwafwi cloak.~
@3587 = ~The de'Arnise Keep has been invaded.

With both Lord de'Arnise and Nalia dead, none of her family are left to carry on the keep... and without one of them alive, killing TorGal and routing his forces was a pointless victory.  Fortunately, Nalia's body remains in my possession and I have been asked to raise her as soon as possible.~
@3588 = ~You are filled with a sudden sense of dread as the room fills with the sound of shifting stone. A door has sealed itself shut somewhere nearby.~
@3589 = ~Getting Inside the Asylum

Once we got inside the guildhouse, the courtesan warned me that I still wouldn't be able to wander about too much, even with the medallion.  I was offered a sleeping draught, which could put the entire household to sleep if put into the food... although the courtesan had no idea how the cook might be convinced to do so.~
@3590 = ~The wooden structure lies over a deep pit.  You cannot tell the exact depth of the pit, but when you toss a pebble into its maw, you never hear the stone hit the bottom.~
@3591 = ~Nalia Abducted By Isaea Roenall

A soldier named Khellor told me of how I might be able to expose Isaea's corruption and secure Nalia's release.  A contact of Isaea's is named Barg and can be located at the docks in the Docks District.  He also said I might look into Isaea's records at his home just northwest of the government building in the Government District.  Anything I find I should report to Isaea's commander, Corgeig, who can be found in the government building, itself.~
@3592 = ~Valygar's family quest is over.

Valygar's quest is finally done.  Lavok was not what he expected, and has caused the normally judgmental ranger to think deeply about what he has experienced.  With the necromancer dead and the Cowled Wizards no longer hunting him, the ranger has gone on his own way.  I doubt I shall see him again.~
@3593 = ~Finish the leather armor begun by Rejiek Hidesman

I found the man mentioned in the letter I found at Rejiek's home and correctly named him as 'Darcin Cole'.  He thinks I am Rejiek, and will finish the skin armor if I bring him the blood of a silver dragon... wherever one might be.~
@3594 = ~Wouldn't we all, mate?  I be havin' all the finest sorts o' mead and ale... an' if I end up havin t' toss ye in a room upstairs, it costs ye extra.~
@3595 = ~Ah, if it don't be a familiar face.  Ye have returned to the Sea's Bounty, and the Thumb does bid ye welcome.  Does ye have a bit o' thirst, aye?~
@3596 = ~I don't know why we get so many young nobles slumming here... you'd think they'd be smart enough to keep out of the Docks.~
@3597 = ~"Oh, me mother went a'sailin'
And she became a captain too
She pulled her mate o'er her knees
And spanked 'im black an' blue!"~
@3598 = ~"The mate then ran ashore on leave
And cried an' cried all day
Said me mother was an orc
An' that she'd have t' pay!~
@3599 = ~"The mate then roused up all th' crew
An' they cried out for 'er head
But me mother, she's a smart one
She jus' winked 'er eye an' said...~
@3600 = ~"Johnny, ye're a dumb one,
Does ye think that I was blind?
If ye hadn't given reason
I'd ne'er spanked yer sore behind~
@3601 = ~"When the winds picked up an' tossed the ship
From yonder to an' fore
Ye went an' screamed jus' like a girl
An' forgot yer sailor lore~
@3602 = ~"Because when ye are a sailor,
Ye put other thoughts behind
Ye gives the ship yer courage
And ye pays yer fear no mind~
@3603 = ~"Well, the crew all did agree with her
They threw Johnny o'erboar'
And that's why you'll hear Johnny cryin'
When the winds they start to roar!~
@3604 = ~"An' that's why you'll hear Johnny cryyyyyin'
When the wiiiinds they start tooooo roooaaar!"~
@3605 = ~Sailors an' thieves... Athkatla be full o' them both!~
@3606 = ~The Sea's Bounty be a nice pub an' all, but if ye steps outside, ye be as likely to have yer pocket picked as not.~
@3607 = ~The Sea's Bounty be a fine an' grand place.  <hic!>  Hmm... where's my coin purse?~
@3608 = ~It is good to see you again. I had hoped you'd return. There's little here for me. Do you... do you still need another party member?~ [NALIA94]
@3609 = ~The sailors around here are so handsome... but their language is simply atrocious!  I cannot decide if this tavern is worth my time.~
@3610 = ~Yes, I remember.  Well, you may be right... perhaps we should ask them?~
@3611 = ~Errr... alright.  Foul intruders!  We shall stop you for our master!~
@3612 = ~They say this be the City of Coin... and it be the last place ye want to be if ye have none.~
@3613 = ~I don't know why they have one o' the guards here in the slums... he gets paid so much money he might as well be blind, aye?~
@3614 = ~I've heard more than a few stories about that there circus over on the promenade... but I don't believe a none o' it.~
@3615 = ~Just a word o' caution... ye don't want to be dealin' too much with Lehtinan, there.  He's the evil sort, an' I don't use that term lightly.~
@3616 = ~This is the pleasure room... you're welcome to join us.  Or sleep for a while.  We all end up asleep, here, eventually...~
@3617 = ~... MmmMmmm... my, but you are a pretty one?  Would you care to join me, my pretty elf?...~
@3618 = ~... Care to sample some of our Black Lotus, my good friend?...~
@3619 = ~No thank you, good sir.  I've... already attempted the experience once before.~
@3620 = ~... HahaHAhahaHAHA...(giggle)~
@3621 = ~... I think Lehtinan is the most DARLING man to make this place for us...~
@3622 = ~... MMMmmm... all I can think of is those slaves in the pit... what was that gorgeous one's name?  Hendak?  MMmmm...~
@3623 = ~... I've won twice today betting on Hendak, that fighting slave... wonderful man, that...~
@3624 = ~I wonder if they're going to start another fight soon?  Hmmm... maybe I'll just take a quick nap, instead...~
@3625 = ~This sort of place would normally be beneath me... but it has some of the most wonderful entertainments, you see.  If you know how to ask for them.~
@3626 = ~Ahhh... I do miss the days of being fabulously entertained in the back rooms.  But Hendak does still run a fine place.~
@3627 = ~Have you seen that huge sphere?  How absolutely dreadful.  I seem to remember something about it... some story about a wizard?  Hm.  Whatever.~
@3628 = ~That's the only thing I hate about coming here... beggars!  Beggars everywhere!~
@3629 = ~I've won several matches with those dogs of Surly's!  What a delightfully vicious little game!~
@3630 = ~I am the keeper of the creatures that fight in the pit.  My wild ones do well... our record is excellent, especially my lovely Tabitha, here.  Isn't that right, my precious?~
@3631 = ~Champion's Strength~
@3632 = ~I warn you, however... if you dare to tell so much as one other person about this place... we will know about it.  And you will suffer the consequences.  Now go.~
@3633 = ~If you have, then I am ready to add my skills to your repertoire.  What say you?~
@3634 = ~I... well, you're the one that knows them!  They're not going to kill you just because you're looking for the whereabouts of a spy... er... thief.  Bah!~
@3635 = ~You may dislike me... whoever you are... but would you not even take a small risk for Montaron?  A faultless soul, and likely being tortured even as we speak!~
@3636 = ~Forget it... I'm not falling for that trick.~
@3637 = ~My... my name is Renfeld... (groan)  I have been poisoned... I beg you to take me to... friends... they have a building not far away from here... please, I beg you!~
@3638 = ~It is... no trick!  I am dying... please, I ask for your help!~
@3639 = ~Your soul shall be fodder!~
@3640 = ~Patience will give us power... soon.~


@3643 = ~You are new... you smell different.~
@3644 = ~The cabin boy, the cabin boy, that dirty little nipper... ahh the sea, she calls me.~
@3645 = ~You are quite the novelty... I never seen your like before.~
@3646 = ~You seem... interesting. I not used to such as you.~
@3647 = ~You are very different. I find that... interesting.~
@3648 = ~Leave here and do not return until your world ends.~
@3649 = ~You are... different.~
@3650 = ~I smell... outsider?~
@3651 = ~Some will not trust you... some like me.~
@3652 = ~I don't know you. You are... stranger.~
@3653 = ~Seek out the befoulers!~
@3654 = ~You! Are you for hire? As a mercenary, I mean? You look capable and hearty, like you've had formal training.~
@3655 = ~Your grace, I am Mazzy Fentan, a valiant servant of justice and righteousness. As you can see, I could use your assistance.~ [MAZZY76]
@3656 = ~Obviously you're not to be trusted. Even if you speak the truth, you deserve your fate.~
@3657 = ~Contemptuous oaf! Have you no honor? If this is to be my fate, then don't envenom it further with your presence.~
@3658 = ~It is here to dominate and to conquer. This Shade Lord seems to feed on the corruption of souls. If it is not stopped it will continue to build its army of shadows.~
@3659 = ~You've a spiteful soul, <CHARNAME>. I'll go no further in this group. Leave me be. I have important work to accomplish and I'll not have it soiled with your presence.~
@3660 = ~They died with honor regardless of what the Shade Lord did to them afterwards.~
@3661 = ~Why don't you return when you've made some money? Perhaps you could pit-fight for the funds. Surly pays a bit to the winners of the dog fights.~
@3662 = ~Yes, but we need to negotiate the price.~
@3663 = ~Thanks... wait... you don't really mean it.~
@3664 = ~You there! You look like you've... killed... before. Are you mercenaries? Capable mercenaries? No offense, but I need some help and it requires a harsh touch. 

~
@3665 = ~Perhaps I can be of assistance, but my time is a valuable commodity.~
@3666 = ~At present I am on sabbatical. I find myself missing the road and I long again for adventure. Does your party require another sword arm?~
@3667 = ~My lost companions, my boon friends. May your souls rest in peace. I shall always carry your courage and your honor with me. I shall strike down evil in your name!~ [MAZZY78]
@3668 = ~But... no, there is no point in arguing. Very well, but I hope you reconsider. Who knows what horrors are being visited upon my poor family even as we speak.~
@3669 = ~You are very cruel. My family will be paupers... think of the servants we employ. We are kind, and I have given more than my share to those less fortunate.~
@3670 = ~I would not have thought you so snobbish, but you certainly act it. I... I guess I cannot be choosy. I need help wherever I can get it. Will you help me?~
@3671 = ~I risk my neck for a favor, save you from some kind of enchanted slavery... and the first thing you think of is bad poetry?!~
@3672 = ~Some secrets are for keeping, Haer'Dalis.~
@3673 = ~It should be on Mekrath's altar... should you retrieve it, I will be with my mistress at the playhouse under the Five Flagons, waiting anxiously for its return.  May we meet again...~
@3674 = ~A bard to sing my praises? My dear Haer'Dalis, how could I refuse?~
@3675 = ~And tear you from your troupe, Haer'Dalis? The critics would drag me through the coals for stealing such a fine talent.~
@3676 = ~Now... in the altar of this wizard's lair is a very important gem.  Our dear friend Mekrath took it from me and I must have it back. Come, let us look for it and return to Raelis as soon as possible.~
@3677 = ~I fear I cannot. You will have to get someone else.~
@3678 = ~I must return to Raelis, but please... find that gem and bring it to me there.  Both she and I shall be greatly in your debt.~
@3679 = ~You are with Raelis?  Well, well, well... my hide may yet be saved.  Come, let me join with you and we shall be done with the foul humors of this place.~
@3680 = ~There you are!  I've been waiting positively AGES for you.  I did a little scouting around and the outer walls have been breached.  That means they are inside, and we'll have a tough time getting them out.~ [NALIA60]
@3681 = ~I've practiced!  I'm going to be someone that gives to the poor and takes from the rich, I am.  We've got lots to spare... and it's fun, too.~
@3682 = ~Whatever the reason, they are here. I am sorry, but I don't know numbers or tactics; I only know that we must get rid of them... we must rescue my family, that is all.~
@3683 = ~You'll have to sneak in and rescue someone. Perhaps... oh, what's his name... Daleson, the servant that tended the stables. He might be in there. Will you find him?~
@3684 = ~I had no interest in you before, and I have no interest in you now.~
@3685 = ~We need more information. If we march through the front door it will be a slaughter.~
@3686 = ~We don't know how many they have, how smart they are, or even if there is anyone left alive to rescue.~
@3687 = ~Perhaps... oh, what's his name... Daleson! He worked in the stables. They may have left him to tend the animals for food. He would know! He might be inside.~
@3688 = ~But you have come all this way... No, if you do not wish to help then I will not ingratiate myself further. I see quite enough of that from the nobles around here.~
@3689 = ~Is it cowardly to live through the day? You can certainly storm the front gates if you like, but what happens to my family when the trolls realize you are there?~
@3690 = ~Enter north of the palisade, though a secret door along the wall of the keep.  I used it to sneak out at night.  Aunty never approved, but I didn't care.~
@3691 = ~Is it cowardly to live through the day? We can storm the front gates if you like, but what happens when the trolls realize we are there?~
@3692 = ~I can't go another step without knowing who we face. I will not go blind into this.~
@3693 = ~We need more information. A frontal assault would be a slaughter.~
@3694 = ~We don't know how many they have, or even if there is anyone left alive to rescue.~
@3695 = ~Yes, my friend. I thank you again for your support. I suggest that we seek out the Temple Superior, Overgold Renwellyn. We've no proof of Barl's guilt other than Wallace's word and my suspicions.~
@3696 = ~Why no, I've seen them just this week. I expect wedding bells'll be comin' for the two of them.~
@3697 = ~Shut up and listen, old man. We know your buddy Barl's been poisoning people and we're gonna kill him. Where is he?~
@3698 = ~I assure you this is true.  Barl supplies Wallace, a local merchant, with potions... and one of those potions poisoned Mazzy's sister.~
@3699 = ~What? But I just joined... oh, very well. I can't wait around for you though. I have to go to my family's land and help them. If you still want to help then that's where you should go. I'll meet you there and we can plan the attack.~ [NALIA97]
@3700 = ~I have no intention of helping you. Get someone else.~
@3701 = ~But... but we've been together such a short while. Please, do you still intend to help me defend my family's keep?~ [NALIA93]
@3702 = ~Please, you did promise.  We need to go to my family's land and join the defense. If you have changed your mind, please tell me.~ [NALIA69]
@3703 = ~You could have said earlier! I need to be there! They may already be... Goodbye and thanks for nothing!~
@3704 = ~We must get to Daleson soon. They may kill him, and then we'll have no idea what we're up against!  He should be inside next to the secret door.~ [NALIA71]
@3705 = ~Now, there be a vital gem nestled within the stench of this place... in an altar, I believe.  Mekrath took it from me and I must have it back.  Come, let us retrieve it before we venture further.~
@3706 = ~Mekrath has stolen an important gem from my keeping and locked it away within an altar in this lair.  Find it and I shall stand guard over ye mewling babes 'til we return to Raelis.~
@3707 = ~You want fight Gorf? Hah, hah, hah!~
@3708 = ~Ugh, that much good. Gorf ready to fight, pit man!~
@3709 = ~How dishonorable! The boorishness of the large people never ceases to amaze me.~ [MAZZY84]
@3710 = ~You told him, Mazzy!~
@3711 = ~We need comrades, not servants, Haer'Dalis. What skills do you bring with you?~
@3712 = ~It'll do... Welcome to the group, Haer'Dalis.~
@3713 = ~More than enough, Haer'Dalis, more than enough. My apologies for doubting you.~
@3714 = ~It is mine and I was on my way to deliver it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe when he captured me.  Come, let us find it that Ms. Shai may reward us both for its safe delivery.~
@3715 = ~I don't believe that it's any of your business, hound. Now may I join you or is this meeting over?~
@3716 = ~You're right: This meeting's over.~
@3717 = ~Of that, you have my word... Come, my late but unmourned captor has hidden a gem in an altar, here. It is imperative that I return it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe and soon. You have my assurance that her reward shall be generous.~
@3718 = ~A word to the wise, however: it is best you come to her with gifts. I had a gem that would have served the purpose nicely but the late Mekrath saw fit to steal it from my hands.  It is in an altar in this place... I strongly recommend you take it with you.~
@3719 = ~Very well, Haer'Dalis. Friendship... Welcome aboard.~
@3720 = ~I believe the jewel lies within an altar, here... If we can find the jewel and complete the delivery, then I shall place myself at your every command.~
@3721 = ~If you find it, I ask that you deliver it to the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe where I will be waiting. I will see to it that my mistress rewards you greatly. Now fare thee well, my hounds of rescue, for time is short.~
@3722 = ~This is the second half of the Rift Device Rod. The completed Rod may be used for the destruction of the Unseeing Eye.~
@3723 = ~The mysterious Rift Device. 
This rod is said to be so destructive that it was cursed by the gods and buried deep within the Earth. The ancient god Amaunator and his worshippers were charged with the task of guarding it. Amaunator's fading Avatar has allowed you to use it with the expressed purpose of destroying the Unseeing Eye. The Avatar asked that you return it when your task is done, as it would be exceptionally dangerous to bring this device above ground.~
@3724 = ~If we can find it, a certain Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe shall reward us greatly for its return. Come, let us search for it and be done with these wretched airs.~
@3725 = ~Should you find it, I ask that you deliver it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe. I will see to it that my mistress rewards you greatly.~
@3726 = ~You wound me... 'twas a simple verse.  You think, mayhap, that my brain has been addled too long by arcane spells?  Oh, what tragedy!~
@3727 = ~You can... feel the wrongness in such a place.  It has seeped into the very rocks, themselves.~ [MAZZY18]
@3728 = ~Mekrath has given you to me fairly... your only other choice would have been to remain a mindless slave.~
@3729 = ~I'm from Imnesvale in the Umar Hills.  People h-have been disappearing.  Some of them have t-t-turned up, but they're all turned inside-out and mad.~
@3730 = ~I suppose such actions are the only means of raising your status, but I still want your tromping about in these halls kept to a minimum. Delousing will interfere with my social schedule.~
@3731 = ~Obviously those filthy creatures have swung the doors wide to any common traveler. You do look somewhat different than the fiends that entrapped me.~
@3732 = ~Nalia sent you, didn't she? Only she would know where to get such ruffians. Consorting with servants will leave her dead like her softhearted mother, earning a virulent fever for her charitable excesses.~
@3733 = ~I have a hazy recollection of it being in an altar, here... but should you ever find it, I know an actress of the Sigil theater troupe, Raelis Shai, who would pay a fine reward to any who might bring it to her.~
@3734 = ~I must find it again so it may be returned to its rightful owner, Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe... Your help in this would mean a million worlds to me.~
@3735 = ~Your friend Mekrath stole from me a certain gem that I must have back. If you can find it in this place... in an altar, if I remember right... please bring it to me at the playhouse. You will not go unrewarded.~
@3736 = ~The gem is in an altar, here... so let's return it and reap a good reward. So put aside your illusions of grandeur for a while and help me find the blasted thing before Mekrath comes back.~
@3737 = ~I suppose I should expect nothing less. Your lack of breeding is apparent in your close-set eyes. Loot as you will, but you will not get the satisfaction of a fearful response from me.~
@3738 = ~I think you should be afraid. I do not keep baggage for no purpose. Prepare to die.~
@3739 = ~Do, as you will. I will not lose my dignity just because you threaten my life. Indeed, I would rather die than lose respect for myself. Frankly, I don't know how you peasants stand it.~
@3740 = ~... until yon mage cast me into bondage, of course.  Miss Shai will reward you greatly for the jewel, of that I have no doubt. So come, I believe it lays in an altar here... let us find it 'ere the wizard returns.~
@3741 = ~'Twas mine before my capture and I was delivering it to Raelis Shai, the Mistress of the Sigil theater troupe.  I do not doubt that she would still reward us greatly for its delivery.  Come, let us find it and be gone from here before the wizard fool returns.~
@3742 = ~Do you now? Perhaps you are unsure where your place is? Below mine, and while your current actions may place my life in your hands, they certainly do not elevate you above your true station.~
@3743 = ~Alright, then... just join with me and we'll figure it out as we go along.~
@3744 = ~I don't have time for this... if you really want to go, then go.  I don't need a companion who babbles so much.~
@3745 = ~It is in an altar, here, and we must bring it to Raelis Shai, mistress of the Sigil theater troupe.  I assure you, she shall be more than pleased to see it. Come, let us find it before more unpleasantness occurs.~
@3746 = ~Haer'Dalis, there is always room for one such as you within my company.~
@3747 = ~I doubt he will say a word. He's as soft as Nalia at times, but he does not lower himself to dealing with his lessers. Do rescue him, will you? It is your duty, I believe.~
@3748 = ~In an altar, here, if I remember right.  Once this gem was mine, you see, and it must be mine once more that I might deliver it to Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe for she has need of it.  Come, let us search this place and then make this long-delayed delivery.~
@3749 = ~Oh, 'tis like a nightmare!  Yet more hooligans tracking their filth through the halls! We shall have to vacation for a tenday while the whole building is deloused.~ [DELCIA02]
@3750 = ~You are angry, my friend.  This I understand implicitly.  Injustice and indifference have always been the banes of our society.  I often suspect that these sins pose more of a danger to us than any dragon ever could.~ [MAZZY67]
@3751 = ~When Kalos heard Dana was gone, he and his friends took up what arms they could.  They stormed the Baron's manor unthinking, like men gone berserk.~
@3752 = ~If you could only find it and bring it to my quarters at the playhouse beneath the Five Flagons Inn, I promise you Miss Shai would be most grateful.~
@3753 = ~It bears repeating my dear. She would slum as you do, offering charity to those beneath her, and her reward was a pestilence that took her life.~
@3754 = ~Milady, we should save such discussion for another TIME. Let's move on. NOW.~
@3755 = ~What am I saying? You will NEVER need to worry about being in a position such as I hold. Simply don't have the blood for it.~
@3756 = ~Nalia, I think we should let your aunt get to safety while we MOVE ON. Now. Please.~
@3757 = ~I would like that, Haer'Dalis.~
@3758 = ~Return to your playhouse, Haer'Dalis. I shall look for this jewel you speak of and bring it to you there.~
@3759 = ~Raelis Shai, Mistress of the Sigil theater troupe, beneath the Five Flagons Inn, would be more than pleased to have it in her possession. Come, let us retrieve it and make haste unto the playhouse.~
@3760 = ~I believe the gem to be in an altar, here... if you could retrieve it and return it to me at the playhouse, Mistress Shai would be most pleased. It would be advisable that you hurry, too, as Mekrath will no doubt be returning shortly.  Now I must go.~
@3761 = ~Before my capture at Mekrath's hands, I carried with me a certain gem.  I believe it to be in an altar, here... deliver it to me at the playhouse below the Five Flagons and Miss Shai will be more than grateful.~
@3762 = ~Hmm? Oh! Yes, we should... really get moving. You will be safe back the way we came, Aunty, but I cannot go with you yet.~
@3763 = ~You needn't whisper, dear, but do try to refrain from talking behind my back with the help, will you? It does not do them good to see their betters maligned.~
@3764 = ~Rather an amusing bit of restraint on your part, and I appreciate that. She's decent enough, but very set in her ways and hard to deal with. Come, we must rescue my father.~ [NALIA72]
@3765 = ~What? And who be you then? Come 'round the back way did ye? I suppose ye must have. Nothin' but trolls and snakes the front way. What are ye doin' here then?~
@3766 = ~Fear not, I have come to rescue you.~
@3767 = ~You? Rescue me?  I ain't nobody, even the trolls know that, so they left me to tend the animals cuz I ain't no threat.  Did Miss Nalia send you?~
@3768 = ~Now why would you want to go and do something like that? Sure don't sound like you care much for the likes of me. It were Miss Nalia what sent you, wasn't it?~
@3769 = ~Will you now? And why do you care about this place? Could only be two reasons. Either you heard this place ain't as poor as you say, or... or Miss Nalia sent you.~
@3770 = ~Nalia did send me, and I just meant that I would stop the trolls from taking over.~
@3771 = ~It's not like that at all. I'm just more interested in the combat and reward.~
@3772 = ~Nothin' personal, but thrillseekers like you get us little guys hurt.  I guess you're better than nothing, and probably better than Nalia.  She means well, I suppose, but she's still a noble.~
@3773 = ~Maybe thirty.  There was a big troll that seemed to be in charge.  I've kept out of sight, but I also heard him bossing something called a "yuan-ti".  I don't know how many of those there are.~
@3774 = ~Probably took him down to the dungeon.  Lord de'Arnise had his dungeon boarded up, but I think them trolls sniffed it out.  Don't know why they didn't just kill everyone.~
@3775 = ~I'll just be staying right here, thanks all the same. They ain't bothered to come get me yet, and if you go out there making trouble, I think this is the safest place for me.~
@3776 = ~Of course not, just having a little fun with you.~
@3777 = ~You... you 're no better than the monsters out there. Have it your way, but make no mistake you will pay for this in the long run, I just knows it!~
@3778 = ~This place isn't open to your kind anymore. This estate and all its possessions are now in the care of Family Roenall. Move along, rabble.~
@3779 = ~He is well. He told me their strengths, and that a Lord de'Arnise was still alive.~
@3780 = ~Storm Ring

This ring is worn by followers of the Storm Lord Talos, whose disciples await their god's wrath and welcome it eagerly.  The ability to wreak havoc and ruin are the principle ideals that Talos desires to see in his subjects.~
@3781 = ~Sniff... SNIFFFFFF... I smell you... I do... you gradunk no be hiding on TorGal!~ [TOGAL03]
@3782 = ~I rain 'cross many places, what think you gradunk leave here dry? I TorGal, and I trgank lead Rocksmash pack! We serve Stronger, so who traag you to say no?!~
@3783 = ~You grrranktal no tell me what be done! None but Stronger tell TorGal what fregRrrrt be done! Who you to say to Rocksmash pack? GweRrl?~
@3784 = ~Who ask grgath like you what should die? Rocksmash pack think all die, now have what stronger grrreth want. TorGal do good job, now you rrrthag die for fun!~
@3785 = ~Mekrath stole it from me and has hidden it in an altar within this place. Come, let us rescue it from its unjust confinement and reap our reward at the playhouse.~
@3786 = ~I believe it to be in an altar, here... return it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe.  I assure you that my mistress, Raelis Shai, would be more than grateful.  With your leave, my hounds of chaos, I must make my exit. I pray we meet again.~
@3787 = ~Goodman Valygar!  I tire.  Would you please prepare my bedroll and fetch extra wood for the fire.  There seems to be a chill in the air.~ [MAZZY50]
@3788 = ~Perhaps I should have made a formal request, but... I am new to this as well... There is none other more fit to be my squire.  You are a gentleman... a friend.~
@3789 = ~It is a large building... a large orange building to the southwest of the Docks District. There will be a man guarding the door... his name is Rylock.  Please, take me to him...~
@3790 = ~It is... no use, I am afraid.  I have already attempted to neutralize the poison inside me.  I... do not know... what has been done to me.  Please... I must go to my friends...~
@3791 = ~Very well... I will take you now.~
@3792 = ~Reward?  (groan)  I... I have nothing to offer you... aside from my gratitude and those of my friends.  Please... I do not have much time...~
@3793 = ~Very well... I'll take you there.~
@3794 = ~Th-thank you.  I... do not have long to live.  You must take me there quickly...  (groan)  ... take me to Rylock...~
@3795 = ~H-have... have you no compassion?  I... I am dying.  Nobody will aid me... please, I am begging you...~
@3796 = ~You?  P-please... I ask you again... please help me...~
@3797 = ~He has been poisoned, somehow... but he said magic was not able to cure it.  He seemed desperate to find you.~
@3798 = ~He is... sick?  I shall bring him inside immediately.  Thank you, friend, for doing this.  We are most grateful.  Here is a small reward for you troubles.~
@3799 = ~A reward?  Er... yes, I suppose so.  For you trouble.  Renfeld appears ill... I must take him inside immediately.  Thank you.~
@3800 = ~This is a private residence.  Thank you for bringing Renfeld to me.  He appears ill, so I must bring him inside immediately.  Some coin... for your trouble.~
@3801 = ~Poisoned?  By the gods!  Thank you... I must bring him inside immediately!  Here is some coin, for your trouble.  I thank you again, friend.~
@3802 = ~Yes?  Is there someth... Renfeld?  He is dead?  What has happened to him?~
@3803 = ~Poisoned?  It is a sad thing, then, that he did not arrive to us soon enough.  Thank you for bringing his body... we are most appreciative.~
@3804 = ~Hm.  Alright... for your trouble, I suppose.  I thank you again for bringing the body to us.  Good day to you.~
@3805 = ~None of those questions are your concern.  Here... some money to cover your trouble.  I must take him inside, now... thank you and good day.~
@3806 = ~We maintain the balance, fool... and every Harper goes more out of his or her way for the common good than anyone else ever cares to.  (sigh)~
@3807 = ~You have one of our brethren with you!   We must resurrect her immediately and... what is wrong? I feel great ugliness around her... a foul curse!~
@3808 = ~Good. This will make things easier for every one.~
@3809 = ~I am yours to command.~ [MAZZY22]

(Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 5
Range: 15 yards
Duration: 1 turn +1 round/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

A caster who performs a conjure lesser earth elemental spell summons a earth elemental to do his bidding.  The elemental is 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires or upon the elemental's death.  However, every time this spell is cast there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster upon which it will go berserk attacking the mage who dared summon it.  If it can't reach the summoner it will fight its way towards him.  This berserking elemental will also remain until slain, or the spell duration expires.  This spell requires rigid concentration after the casting in order to implant control in the summoned creatures psyche.  The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for three rounds after being summoned.  At the end of this time if the caster has won he has control of the elemental.  However, if he has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill him.  This does not prevent the use of other charm type spells cast afterwards if the contest was lost.  It might be good to note that if charm spells are used before the contest is over they will have no effect on the outcome.~

@3826 = ~And we shall... shall... charge admission!  Yes!  Admission!  Oooo!  Now that IS a good idea...~
@3827 = ~Jaheira, our meeting here was no accident. I have waited for this moment, for this time when I would reward your filthy libelous ways.~
@3828 = ~No, I don't think... oh, yes.  I reckon someone did do just that a couple o' weeks ago.  Zapped into a pile o' ashes quicker than ye could blink.~

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

The caster of the Armor of Faith receives significant protection against melee and magical attacks.  This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster.  At first level, the protection is set to 5%, and every five levels of the caster improves this by another 5%.  A 20th level priest would have 25% of her damage 'absorbed' if protected by this spell. Note that this is not cumulative with any other protections, physical nor magical, including itself.~

@4043 = ~(sniff)  They really should do something about that murderer fellow in these parts... or at least force him not to flay his victims.  How ghastly!~
@4044 = ~(sniff)  I tried going to that theater they have in the cellar, here, but it is so dusty and drab.  That, and the plays are horribly melodramatic.~

Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The priest employs this spell to set up a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating an impenetrable barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the blade barrier suffers 8D8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. If this is successful, the blades are avoided and no damage is suffered.  The barrier remains for ten rounds.~

Level: 7
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

Uttering a holy word spell creates magic of tremendous power.  The priest acts as a bridge between his god and the prime material plane causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 30' radius.  It affects only evil creatures or creatures of any evil alignment that are caught in the area of effect.  The effects differ according to the level of the target as follows:

Hit Dice or levels  --  Effects of Holy word
Less than 4  --  Death
4 to 7  --  Stunned for 1 turn
8 to 11  --  Slowed for 1 turn with 75% chance of spell failure
12 and up  --  Deafened for 1 turn with 50% chance of spell failure

There is no saving throw vs. this spell and the effects are instantaneous and last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.  Note that this spell may not be cast by any priest of evil alignment.~

@4085 = ~I think it is such a shame that they just do not search all the houses and round up all the sorcerers and just... do away with them all!~
@4086 = ~I hope me husband gets back soon from Trademeet... I hear that there's been trouble there as o' late.~

@4088 = ~I don't know why the guards don't take a harsher stance against th' thieves in this city... hang them all, I says.~
@4089 = ~They should round up all the thieves, here... especially them Shadow Thieves... and just kick 'em out o' the city, I thinks!~

@4092 = ~Get on, get on... don't bother a poor halfling woman who's runnin' the hair off her feet, almost.~
@4093 = ~I haven't got anything to say to ye... ye're as likely to rob me as skin me, methinks.~
@4094 = ~Calm yourself, little one, and restore your senses to some form of order.  I am no murderer.  A killer, perhaps, when I must... although I doubt you would detect the difference.~
@4095 = ~(shudder)  You... you look like you could be a murderer, to me!~
@4096 = ~Not bad intuition, halfling.  Flawed and incorrect... but overall quite respectable.  (The insult deserves a fireball, but it would only prove her right!  Bah!)~

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell the wizard creates one image of himself that will travel along beside him.  The image will perform all of the actions that the wizard does so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard they will not know which one is real.  There is a 50% chance that an attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that he will attack the caster.  The image will disappear with a successful dispel magic, when attacked or when the spell duration runs out.~

Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When cast at a point designated by the wizard this spell will cancel all illusion/phantasm spells of 3rd level and lower in the area.  The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, and Non-detection.  It is important to note that the caster can control just who this spell affects.  Therefore, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party.  The area of effect is roughly a 20' radius around the target.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.~
@4128 = ~Stoneskin (Alteration) 
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon himself, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground completely covering him.  This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every 2 levels of the caster an additional skin is gained upon casting, for example a 10th level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th level wizard would receive 10.  For each skin the wizard possesses the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against him, but the sixth would affect him normally.  The skins will remain on the wizard until he is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks such as fireball, however it will protect him from physical magical attacks such as magic missile.~
@4129 = ~Teleport Field (Alteration) 
Level: 4
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

With this spell, the wizard instigates a teleportation effect as far as the wizard can see.  All enemies in this area are randomly teleported for the duration of the spell unless they Save. Vs.

@4131 = ~Breach (Abjuration)

Range: Visual sight of caster

@4132 = ~Pierce Magic (Abjuration) 
Level: 6
Range: Visual sight of caster 
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target Creature 
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects.  The first is that the creature's magic resistance will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster.  The second is that it will cancel one spell protection of 8th level or lower on the creature.  For example if this spell was cast by a 15th level wizard the target creature would lose 15% magic resistance from his current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains, as well as cancelling one 8th level or lower spell protection.  The list of spells that this includes is: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe Of Invulnerability.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.  The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~
@4133 = ~True Sight (Divination) 
Level: 6
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 70' radius
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 70 feet in radius around the caster will be effected.  Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile illusion/phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled.  The spells that are affected by this are: Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum.  The area of effect is roughly a 70' radius around the caster.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.  This spell only affects enemies, thus it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~
@4134 = ~Contingency (Evocation) 
Level: 6
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Permanent until used 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells.  One spell level for every three levels of the caster is allowed up to 18th level or 6th level spells.  Once the spell is chosen the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided.  The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his/her hit points to an enemy being sighted.  Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.  For example a 12th level wizard could place the spell stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his hit points'.  Then in combat once the wizard is reduced to 50% of his hit points or below, stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him.  This requires no action by the wizard, it happens automatically and instantaneously.  The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster.  Therefore it cannot be an offensive spell and cannot target any other party members.~

@4137 = ~I'm warning everyone, so as to get the word out that there are guards on the streets. We've had a... a string of killings, and I don't want any more happening.~
@4138 = ~Dangerous enough for people that look for trouble, but when innocents... This is different. Murder, unlike any I've seen in years.~
@4139 = ~Bandits I can understand; they are easy enough to figure out. What's happening here is... it's murder, but not like I've ever seen.~
@4140 = ~Such a remark I would expect from the killer himself. No, I doubt even you would stoop to the crimes of this... this creature.~
@4141 = ~Nothing. They have nothing to take. He kills them and that is all. Not only is it pointless, but he does it in as painful a way as possible. It's... it's sick.~
@4142 = ~Enough of this. I must go about my rounds. If you find any information about the murders, be sure to let me know. Don't go looking for trouble though.~
@4143 = ~A beggar found a piece of thick leather by one of the crime scenes.~
@4144 = ~No disappointment from me. Been pretty quiet around here, which means he hasn't struck again. I haven't caught him, but at least no one has been hurt.~
@4145 = ~Interesting, but not of much help. Lots of people carry or wear leather.~
@4146 = ~Elephant hide, you say? Could be from the circus then. Their tamer might have had contact with elephants. I'll have him questioned at the garrison.~
@4147 = ~I have found out who it is! It was the tanner, Rejiek!~
@4148 = ~Neither of which is conclusive evidence. Lots of people have leather and a smell could be anything! You killed a man over this?~
@4149 = ~I see. Perhaps there was no other way then. It could have been disastrous, but you seem to have done a good job checking him out.~
@4150 = ~Well, that evidence alone would not have allowed me to act against a businessman, but it seems to have served you well. The locals will appreciate that they are safe.~
@4151 = ~Hey, brat, I'll give you ten gold if you answer a few questions.~
@4152 = ~I don't have anything for you, but maybe you can help me?~
@4153 = ~I... I found the body of... of old Bilver. He never hurt no one! He was all bloody an... an... Maybe other beggars know more. All I did was see him.~
@4154 = ~Actually, maybe you could tell me about the crimes in this area.~
@4155 = ~I knows who it was, I do! I'm sure! It's that witch! She's the mean ol' Missus Cragmoon. Mean evil witch! She smacks you for stealin' cookies, that's how I know she's mean!~
@4156 = ~You won't tell her I told, will you? I... I don't wanna be incarc'rated, or whatever she gonna do! You go talk to her, I'm leavin'!~
@4157 = ~Well, that was quite a mouthful. Faraji is a poor child, and a light-fingered one at that. I would take what he says with caution. He is not so wide-eyed as you think.~
@4158 = ~He said you were an evil witch.~
@4159 = ~I see. This child, that finds me old and a little off my noodle, has called me a witch and you have taken that as basis for murder accusations? I think not.~
@4160 = ~You are mistaken, and I would suggest you drop the matter. Some people need secrets, and pursuing this would certainly expose some of mine.~
@4161 = ~What do you have that smells like guril berries?~
@4162 = ~Let me see. Hmm... looks quite thick indeed. Very rare, but I have seen it before. This is elephant hide. Good for strong armor, but I rarely see it.~
@4163 = ~Locally?  Well, let me think. I know of three things with that smell. Guril berries are one, and the bark of the oak is similar. And solik berries, too.~
@4164 = ~What would these things be used for locally?~
@4165 = ~Well, I do a brisk business in guril berries. They are used in folk remedies, turned into topical salves for...*ahem*... intimate afflictions.~
@4166 = ~I'm sorry, I'm closed at the moment. Come back when I have replenished my stock.~ [TANNER02]
@4167 = ~Nothin'. Not a thing.~
@4168 = ~But... hehehh... but...~
@4169 = ~Not telling. You want? You gotta buy. I found it, right near a body. It's mine, so you gotta pay. You pay... a hundred gold. Yeah, a hundred.~
@4170 = ~No? No! Ok, then you pay half. Give me... forty gold!~
@4171 = ~You got what you want so go! I don't need, because it's not human flesh! That is different! Go and dance where you will! Talk to the seller that buys!~
@4172 = ~Come, my scrumptious little curried chicken... shall we be off to an evening of merriment, hm?~
@4173 = ~I'm sure you're wondering what the nose is all about.  It's rather large... even for us gnomes, eh?~
@4174 = ~Go away... you're cramping my style.  If the ladies see me with you, I'll never make a coin.~
@4175 = ~Hah!  I can unequivocally say that I am the wealthiest and best-loved gnome in the entire city!~
@4176 = ~The lasses love you only for your nose, Bertrand.  'Tis a shame to the rest of us... oh, to be lumped in the same class as a gnomish gigolo!  The indignity of it all!~
@4177 = ~How about it, my luscious little porkchop?  You... me... together in an embrace that would shock your mother?~
@4178 = ~Excuse me... might you have a coin to spare my poor, venerable mother?  She would ask for herself, but she lays in a cold, cold room nearly sick to her death, alas...~
@4179 = ~Yes, certainly... here is a gold piece for her.~
@4180 = ~She's sick, is she?  Perhaps you could bring me to her... I might be able to offer her some help.~
@4181 = ~I'm sorry... I can afford to give you nothing.~
@4182 = ~Bless you, my <LADYLORD>!  You are a sweet and generous soul... my mother will be indebted to you forever!~
@4183 = ~I'll pay your gold.~
@4184 = ~Oh, thank you thank you thank you!  I can taste that loaf now... mmmMMMmmm...~
@4185 = ~Wait. There was something. A smell... besides the blood, I mean. I think I smelled... guril berries. Yes, that's it.  Guril berries, or something like it.~
@4186 = ~Hey... you!  Give me your money NOW or you're going to regret it... comprehend, yes?~
@4187 = ~Alright, alright... here you go...~
@4188 = ~I comprehend that you're trying to ply your trade on the wrong person... and you're about to be the one regretting it.~
@4189 = ~Smart move.  Now... in case the subject comes up... ya never seen me...~
@4190 = ~Yeah?  Well... we'll just see about that, won't we...?~
@4191 = ~(grunt!)  Uh!  You!  You give me money... ALL money... NOW!!~
@4192 = ~You'll have to take it from my dead body, ogre... and that's not likely!~
@4193 = ~Oooh, you sure know how to sweet-talk the ladies. I'll be here; you paid for your time.~
@4194 = ~Hmm, that's the one. This... tree bark... stuff? It was stronger smelling on him though. This is the same, but it's faint. What would make him smell like this?~
@4195 = ~Pierce Shield (Abjuration) 
Level: 8
Range: Visual sight of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses.  The target's magic resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster.  Next, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level.  For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th level wizard, the target creature would lose 25% magic resistance from his current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains as well as cancelling one spell protection if the mage currently has one.  The list of spells that this includes is: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap.  Magic resistance does not effect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.  The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.  It cannot be dispelled.

@4196 = ~Don't mind the smell... it's just a bit o' the last catch rubbed off on me.~
@4197 = ~Out on the boats all day... I think I'll be headin' down to the Five Flagons for a pint or two, aye?~
@4198 = ~Ay, now... why are ye looking so crossed-eye at me, hm?~
@4199 = ~So he might have worked with leather? Odd. Well, I hope that helped. You've got what you wanted. Off with you now. Perhaps... no. Goodbye.~
@4200 = ~I... I'm sorry... <cough>  It's just that... I hate the smell of fish...~
@4201 = ~I be tellin' ye... I knows me husband says he be fishin' all day... but I think for certain he's at the Five Flagons!~
@4202 = ~I can clean and gut a fish faster than ye can blink... ye can find our goods down at th' market every day, you can.~
@4203 = ~So... you be the one that solved the murders, aye?  What... you be lookin' fer applause?  I be too busy.~
@4204 = ~I... I was not looking at anything, good fishwife.  I, um, oh never mind.~
@4205 = ~There be a seagull about... an' I've gots meself a sling bullet with 'is name on it!~
@4206 = ~Have ye ever looked a seagull in the eye, eh?  There be evil there... pure evil.  An' I means to hunt them all... all of 'em!~
@4207 = ~Ye haven't seen a seagull about, have ye?  I be Stivan the Seagull Hunter, mighty and famous.  Er... care to buys a feather?  I haves plenty, I does.~
@4208 = ~You would hurt those poor birds?  They are scavengers, only... and I'm sure they have done nothing to you!~
@4209 = ~Wrong!  The demons have carried off three of my brothers, they have... they are a plague upon us sent by the gods!  AND I SPIT UPON YOU, GODS!  <PTEWW!!>  AND AGAIN!!  <PTEWW!!>~
@4210 = ~Oh, look, my dear... it is a commoner, trying to speak to us.~
@4211 = ~My dear Lord Feveron... if you insist on demeaning the peasants as they approach us, you will upset them all.  I have no wish to start another riot.~
@4212 = ~But... but darling, it is so fun to make light of the peasantry.~
@4213 = ~(sigh)  Very well.  My... apologies... commoner.  Your smell offends me almost as much as your demeanor, but as a noble I must learn to tolerate both.  Now go away.~

@4217 = ~I... I'm sorry.  Are you addressing us again?  Do go away.~
@4218 = ~Eek!  The commoner is speaking to me again!  What should I do?  Shoo... shoo, shoo!~
@4219 = ~I am an escort to the Lord Feveron and the Lady Diana... you will maintain your manners with them or suffer the consequences.  Now off with you, citizen, before you make trouble.~
@4220 = ~Spell Trap (Abjuration) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster.  Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap -- making the caster recall a previously cast spell.  For example, a wizard shields himself with spell trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd level spell).  He gets three spell levels back -- he will regain one spell, up to 3rd level in power.
The spell trap protects against 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers Of Death).  The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~
@4221 = ~Sorry for bothering you.~
@4222 = ~Why are you closed? Hiding something, are you?~

Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature.  This includes: Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, Spell Invulnerability, and Spell Trap.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

@4226 = ~Chain Contingency (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None 

Chain contingency channels some of the magical energy of the mage and releases it only under certain circumstances.  Basically, the mage chooses three spells, which will be released under certain conditions such as being hit by an enemy.  When this condition occurs all three spells are cast immediately.  Spells of up to 8th level may be used in the contingency.~
@4227 = ~I don't know what you are getting at.~
@4228 = ~Your class cannot use a second weapon.~
@4229 = ~Boys... boys...  Don't fight over me, please.~ [BUBBLE01]
@4230 = ~You cannot place a two-handed weapon in your off hand.~
@4231 = ~The guard? Ahh, you mean Lieutenant Aegisfield? Good man. We had a chat and he's sure I had nothing to do with any of the recent crimes. Now, if you will excuse me?~
@4232 = ~Most excellent!  I have defeated the loathsome Carbos!  Come, my beloved Bubbles... let us go!~
@4233 = ~Bubbles!  But... but Bubbles!!  But I love you, my chicken pot pie!  Come back!~
@4234 = ~Aha!  That moron, Shank, is now dead!  I am victorious!  Come, my Bubbles... let us go and celebrate this blessed event!!~

@4236 = ~Shapechange (Alteration) 
Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature (mind flayer, iron golem, greater wolfwere, earth elemental, fire elemental, or giant troll).  The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and has almost all of its abilities. Thus, he can change into a mind flayer to stun his opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush his foes.  These creatures have whatever hit points the wizard had at the time of the shape change. Each alteration in form requires only a second, and no system shock is incurred.

Note that the although the assumed form has the combat characteristics of the real creature, it may not have all of its immunities.~
@4237 = ~So, you were the one who has been speaking ill of me? You gathered this... evidence? So there's others that will know too? Then it will not stop here.~ [TANNER06]
@4238 = ~So... you are admitting to being the killer? Why did you do this?~
@4239 = ~I see. You have gathered this... er, evidence? I suppose others will know of this as well then? Then it will not stop with your leaving.~ [TANNER07]
@4240 = ~Not to disappoint you, but there are many, many people that own leather, you among them, I am sure. I make my living selling it, so I know how common it is.~
@4241 = ~See that you don't. Goodbye.~
@4242 = ~What is your point? It is a common smell, especially on new armor. Many sets are sold each day. I am not responsible for how they are used, any more than a blacksmith would be.~
@4243 = ~Well, that is certainly damning evidence. I mean, who would have new smelling leather armor. Perhaps only half of all the people in Athkatla.~
@4244 = ~You should have run away, little fool! You could not understand! My work must go on!~
@4245 = ~(cough!)  Oh... bless you, my <LADYLORD>, bless you!  (cough!)  I did not know how much longer I would survive buried in there as I was!~
@4246 = ~I... I was buried by the men who kidnapped me! (cough!)  They held me for ransom from my family, and after my family had paid they knocked me out.~
@4247 = ~I... I remember being carried here, and thrown into that grave next to another body!  And then they buried me alive!  (cough!)~
@4248 = ~I am sure... I am sure I would have died if you had not arrived so soon!  (shudder!)  What a horrid death these evil men had in store for me!  Ohhh...~
@4249 = ~I woke up with this in my hand... I think I must have torn it off his shirt when he threw me in the grave.  Here... perhaps it will help you find him.~
@4250 = ~Thank you... I shall do my best to locate these man.~
@4251 = ~Oh, no, I couldn't!  These men are still out there... and they will surely come after me and my family if they knew I said anything!~
@4252 = ~Please... you must... you must stop them!  I beg of you!~
@4253 = ~Sorry... I have no time to help you.  You will have to go to the garrison.~
@4254 = ~I... I thank you for saving my life.  But I am still in danger!  <cough!>  You... look capable with your weapons... please find these men and stop them!~
@4255 = ~Only that... there was someone who spoke to this man.  Perhaps the gravekeeper.  You should talk to him, at least... he must have seen something!~
@4256 = ~Thank you... I shall do my best to locate these men and bring them to justice.~
@4257 = ~On second thought, I think there is little I can do.  You have your life, now... go to the garrison or not, it is your choice.~
@4258 = ~Oooh, no, I cannot go to the garrison... but thank you for saving me.  I must return to my family.  I pray these men don't take another victim.  Farewell!~
@4259 = ~I am not sure, Viconia... I have a couple of ideas of where to start looking, though, and I must make the effort.~
@4260 = ~But... that is only my humble opinion.  Of course.~
@4261 = ~Rampah dance! Rampah no be disturbed. You get going. Talk business when you have important!~
@4262 = ~I was not looking to be a farmer, of course.  I just... wanted a place of my own.  Where I could find peace.~
@4263 = ~Over time, we formed an awkward friendship.  He did not ask why I wore my hood, and I slowly began to trust him.  He wondered, though... that was obvious.~
@4264 = ~I woke up to searing pain.  While unconscious, they had abused and tortured me... then tried to bury their sins.~
@4265 = ~Then I will show you when we have the time. I will take you through the deepest lands, and you will see the beauty that I know is there.~
@4266 = ~That is, if you have not tired of my company yet.~
@4267 = ~I see what is there. Beauty is irrelevant.~
@4268 = ~W... well. I would... I would miss your company too, <CHARNAME>.~
@4269 = ~Ho there, I have worked long and lonely hours and it is good to see a friendly face! Care to see some of my trinkets and far-flung wares?~
@4270 = ~Something... for the lady, perhaps? Oh, yes, I see a glint in the eye. There is romance afoot, and it needs the dancing partner of the adornments of affection!~
@4271 = ~Nonsense! Oh, but perhaps I have overstepped my bounds with my observant eyes. I apologize most profusely.~
@4272 = ~Load times will go MUCH faster if you have done a full install.~
@4273 = ~Oh, come now... you have thrived on chaos, have you not?  It has thrown challenge after challenge at you and you have grown stronger and more powerful.~
@4274 = ~I'll not speak of Gorion... or anything else for that matter.  Go away.~
@4275 = ~No... I suppose not.~
@4276 = ~What a... charming fellow. Completely insane of course. Out of his mind. Blind as a bat. No idea what he was saying.~
@4277 = ~Yes... yes of course. Out of his mind. Yes.~
@4278 = ~Whatever, Viconia.  Let's just get back to our traveling, shall we?~
@4279 = ~Let's... let's get going shall we?~
@4280 = ~Um... I...~
@4281 = ~Pathetic creature! Run away, far away, and don't you ever come back!~
@4282 = ~Call me a fiend, will ya?  Why, I've never seen such a cheap funeral in my life!  You sold my clothes and kept the casket closed!  You picked the flowers this mornin' from near the swamp!~ [LESTER02]
@4283 = ~Oh, I'll go back, all right... but not before I kill you, you disgusting piece of filth!  Prepare to die, Nevin!!~
@4284 = ~There!  Stupid git didn't deserve more than a sweater and a kick in the rump, anyway!  Hmph!!  Now... I wonder where my Calimshite darling went off to... always time for one last quickie...~
@4285 = ~You bastard!  Now I'll have to pay to have you reburied!  I should have you chopped into mulch and fed to a dog!!  Gah!  Now... where is that idiot priest...~
@4286 = ~He was a good man, he was.  (sniff!)  Just stubborn... refused to give up his coin pouch to a thief.  Stubborn fool.~
@4287 = ~What? All right then, what is it you want? What are you trying to pull here?~
@4288 = ~What? What did that little weasel tell you? I knew I shouldn't trust him. I had no choice. Them or me.~
@4289 = ~Hold, there... you have an aura of suspicion about you.  I warn you that I am Kamir, Paladin of Helm... I will brook no trespass on this, my darkest of days.~
@4290 = ~I am no more unique than most who come here.  My son lies in yon wee grave.  I... I failed my oath to protect the lad, and he has been taken from me.~
@4291 = ~You are most decent.  I... am not ready to leave just yet.~
@4292 = ~Tirdir? But he's... It was that little weasel Sethle, wasn't it? He told you. I knew I shouldn't trust him! I had no choice though! Them or me!~
@4293 = ~Please... leave us alone.  There is nothing more that can be done for our poor Wellyn.~
@4294 = ~Why would someone do this?  (sob!)  What could possess someone to kill a little boy?  And a halfling, too... he never hurt anyone!~
@4295 = ~Calm yourself, my darling.  There is... nothing more that can be done for him.~
@4296 = ~But why?!  (sob!)  I just... don't... understand...  (sob!)~
@4297 = ~You, there... leave us alone.  Can't you see that my wife is upset?  Just... just leave us be.~
@4298 = ~Yes... Arvoreen's blessing.~
@4299 = ~This is... a terrible tragedy.  My heart goes out to both of you.  Life beyond our simple burrows is never simple or easy.  Arvoreen's blessing upon your son.~
@4300 = ~(sniff!)  Do you... do you truly think so?~
@4301 = ~Thank you, sir.  That is... that is very kind of you to say.~
@4302 = ~I... I couldn't! I can't... I can't stand the blood!~
@4303 = ~And I have.  I mean... I mean that I did.  I love... loved the lad dearly.  Stefan I named him.  Strong, honest boy.~
@4304 = ~Who's there? What do you vermin wish now? The guard will hear of this outrage! Who... You are not my captors. Who are you? I demand to be freed!~
@4305 = ~Well, I thank you then. I have been in this place too long. No doubt my ransom was on the way, but I begin to doubt they would have released me.~
@4306 = ~Tell me about this oath, then... surely it cannot be that bad.~
@4307 = ~I tire of this maudlin whining... I'll leave you to it.~
@4308 = ~But I am.  I failed my vow.  And I know no way in which I can atone for my failure.  If... if there was only some way... I would embrace it, gladly.~
@4309 = ~I and my descendants are in your debt. Farewell.~
@4310 = ~An... an orphan, you say?  Perhaps... perhaps that would be a way... to atone for my failure.  Thank you, my <LADYLORD>... I shall go and talk to them at once.~
@4311 = ~It is no matter.  I do not expect you to.  But please... leave me to my grief a little longer.  I... I am not ready to leave my son just yet.~
@4312 = ~I am Dawnlord Arenthis of the Lathander church... excuse my young charge.  Risa doesn't talk much since the recent death of her parents.~
@4313 = ~Indeed it is.  And there is very little that can be done for her, as well... other than to put her into an orphanage, I suppose.  She is so shy and sad, though, I am sure it will do her no good.  Tsk.~
@4314 = ~If only there were someone who would care for her.  Hmm.  You strike me as a good person... perhaps you would be willing to care for a child in need?  What would you say to that?~
@4315 = ~My life is not for a child... but there is a paladin not far from here who I think might be a suitable guardian.  His own son has just died... and I think he might be amenable.~
@4316 = ~I would not ask you to care for her, surely... but might you know of someone who would make a suitable guardian?~
@4317 = ~You... you are the one I am to meet? I know of no one else that would approach me. Show me the note if you are who you appear to be.~
@4318 = ~Some compassion would not be out of order for one so young and innocent, I would think.  Please... leave us alone, then, if you cannot find it in your heart.~
@4319 = ~Actually, there is a paladin not far from here who I think might be a suitable guardian.  His own son has just died... and I think he might be amenable.~
@4320 = ~I wish this over with quick, so whatever it is, it will have to do.~
@4321 = ~A paladin?  A true paladin?  Perhaps... perhaps that would be an excellent idea.  If he is willing, that is.~
@4322 = ~Please, my <LADYLORD>... it would mean so much if you could find this paladin and ask him about this.  Risa needs a proper guardian much more than an orphanage.  I beg it of you!~
@4323 = ~Forget it... I have better things to do.~
@4324 = ~Our deal is done. May you rot for what you have done.~
@4325 = ~I cannot, my <LADYLORD>.  I must stay and care for Risa.  If you could seek out this paladin, I would be most grateful... and Lathander would smile on you.~
@4326 = ~(sniff!)  ... go 'way!~
@4327 = ~Greetings again, my <LADYLORD>.  Ach... it still pains me so that Risa, here, has no choice but to go to an orphanage.  It would do her little good, I think.~
@4328 = ~Hail once again, my <LADYLORD>.  I... please.  I ask that you leave me to grieve for my son in peace.~
@4329 = ~All right... I shall leave you be.~
@4330 = ~The... the locket is lovely, by the way. Thank you.~
@4331 = ~Greetings... greetings to you both.  I... I understand that the girl is in need of a guardian?~
@4332 = ~... yes.  Yes, I am most pleased to agree.  This is Risa.~
@4333 = ~Oh... you must be very sad...~
@4334 = ~Yes, I am.  I miss him very much.  I think he would approve, however, of me taking care of you.  That is... if you are willing.~
@4335 = ~O-okay... where do you live?~
@4336 = ~Come... I shall show you the church.  Thank you, cleric... and thank you, too, my <LADYLORD>.  I am... most appreciative.~
@4337 = ~I am most pleased at this wonderful turn of events.  Lathander's greatest blessing upon you, my <LADYLORD>, for the part you have played in this.  Sometimes... sometimes Faerun can be a kind place...~
@4338 = ~But one's place is not always apparent.  Who decides on a person's proper place?~
@4339 = ~Magic Resistance (Alteration) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell, the recipient receives a resistance to all magic.  The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the priest up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level.  This resistance is set so if the target already has more magic resistance than the priest would confer, it will actually lower it to the set value.  This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@4340 = ~Is that what you think I am? A traitor? I don't know if I can stomach this. I... I don't want to talk to you of this anymore.~
@4341 = ~I guess that is true. That fool Galvarey sought to do an injustice. He betrayed the spirit of the Harpers, not me. This knowledge will ease my mind.~
@4342 = ~I have been in a similar place as this before, though it was in the company of other Harpers. I will miss those times.~ [JAHEIR95]
@4343 = ~There must be a way to reconcile this matter.~
@4344 = ~I doubt that it will be that easy. Galvarey was as close to a regional leader as the Harpers have. The events will be told from his favor, I am sure.~
@4345 = ~It would seem that the coldest thing in sight is you. I will seek spring in not talking to you.~
@4346 = ~No better comfort could I ask, <CHARNAME>. I will continue to stand for you if you do the same for me. Together we can... togeth...~
@4347 = ~Her actions were in the wrong, no matter her intention.~
@4348 = ~There are times when you seem almost reasonable, and then you say such things that only make me doubt myself. Perhaps... perhaps they were right? I don't know.~
@4349 = ~Avoid them? The Harpers? What are you asking of me?~
@4350 = ~No! I just... this is so damn difficult to get straight. We should... we should speak of this later. Things will be said in anger... Let's move on.~
@4351 = ~Very well.~
@4352 = ~No, this cannot wait. I don't think I can resolve this if it is not discussed. If this is put off... then all I am thinking must be put off.~
@4353 = ~And I do trust you, but I do not trust myself. I am no traitor, of that I am sure, but what am I if I must hide from my brethren? What am I then?~
@4354 = ~I begin to think that most things are simple to you.  You have helped nothing with this comment.  I... I do not wish to continue this.  Let's just go. Quietly.~
@4355 = ~Yes, but can I? There is no middle ground. I am heading for an extreme of either end. With you at least the choice is mine. It is, isn't it?~
@4356 = ~It is not the weather. I just... something is coming and I do not like how it feels. I don't know what it is, but I do not like how it feels.~
@4357 = ~I hope I can offer you such 'kind' words when you need it.  This is no time for humor, thank you.  Let's just keep moving, but... stay close, if you would.~
@4358 = ~I... I am sorry, but I need a moment to collect myself.~ [JAHEIRA2]
@4359 = ~No need to ask. We haven't had time to stop since your meeting with... well...~
@4360 = ~There is no shame in this. You did what you thought was right.~
@4361 = ~No. No it isn't. Blindly on, hitting walls as we go. (sniff) By the gods, let's just get moving. I do so hate getting this sick on emotion.~
@4362 = ~Such a line I have not heard since my early days traveling the hordelands. Thank you for trying to cheer me, but I will manage.~
@4363 = ~Your silver tongue could do with some smithing as well. A bit blunt, I would think.~
@4364 = ~Yes... yes, I suppose I have. How much did I do for you however, and how much was for me alone.~
@4365 = ~No, no it wouldn't. I am sorry, but this will take time once again.~
@4366 = ~Your old injuries feeling alright? I thought I saw you wince a moment ago.~ [JAHEIRA4]
@4367 = ~What? Ah, yes, just a bit of... of knee trouble. A roll of the eyes for the pain.~
@4368 = ~Oh, no, not in the least, really. I am just... I have to deal with a few things... I have to decide some things.~
@4369 = ~So... could I... could I have a few moments of your time?~ [JAHEIRA5]
@4370 = ~As inconvenient as it is, go ahead.~
@4371 = ~Jaheira, this is not a 'chat.' This is more a judicial inquiry.~
@4372 = ~No? The Harper in your midst?~
@4373 = ~You are not 'the Harper in my midst,' you are Jaheira by my side.~
@4374 = ~Is everyone an ally or an enemy? Is everything a matter of battle to you? I had hoped it would not be, but I have had growing doubts to the contrary.~
@4375 = ~I... I don't know what to say to that. I still have many concerns that must be addressed, but you seem so...~
@4376 = ~There has been change all around. You may have been affected in ways you don't know.~
@4377 = ~How... hmm... how did the last battle make you feel? Did you enjoy it?~ [JAHEIRA7]
@4378 = ~I... I am sorry! But I must know! I must know that you are more humane than not! I must know that your... your poison blood has not taken your senses!~
@4379 = ~I guess that would be best, wouldn't it. For... for the best. I will not bother you again.~
@4380 = ~Good morning, my lad. How are ye this morn? I did not wish to startle ye, but I was walking by and could not help but notice this note blowing in the wind.~ [TERMIN02]
@4381 = ~Jaheira! I would have words with you!~ [DERMIN06]
@4382 = ~This is a very special case. You have faced little opposition from the Harpers so far. From here on the attacks will increase in severity, unless you come with me now.~
@4383 = ~Well, that was decidedly unpleasant, and more than I wish to worry about.~
@4384 = ~I am going to do exactly what I said I would do. I am going to think about this. All of this.~
@4385 = ~He was Calimshite, I believe.  They are fond of slaves.  The price for my safety was the favors I bestowed... erotic arts that the Drow have honed for an eon.~
@4386 = ~Actually, I rather enjoyed it: he was quickly my pawn, and the caravan went as I wished.  Alas, his heart gave out one night... the guards thought it murder and chased me away.~
@4387 = ~That's horrible... I can't believe he made you do those things.~
@4388 = ~I had heard manhood was available at a price; I am not surprised to find you copperless.  Cower before my manner, if you must, <CHARNAME>... you disgust me.~
@4389 = ~I think it's disgusting... but I suppose you had little choice.~
@4390 = ~Oh, get away from me, already.  I tire of your ridiculous games.~
@4391 = ~I... I know, I know, my husband.  (sob!)  But I saw my poor little Wellyn, I saw him!  He comes to me at night and he is not at rest!  He was murdered... (sob!) ... and he is not at rest!~
@4392 = ~... Mama?  Papa?  Is that you?~
@4393 = ~Spirit?  I... my name is Wellyn.  I just want... I just want my stuffed bear back...~
@4394 = ~Spirit?  I've... I've never hurt anybody!  My name is Wellyn and I... I just want my stuffed bear back...~
@4395 = ~It's my favorite bear, Littleman... the bad man who came into our house... he, he hurt me and he took Littleman with everything else...  (sob!)  I can never go to sleep without Littleman!~
@4396 = ~Oh... (sob)  I just... I just want my Littleman!  (sob!)  Where is my Mama?  (sob!)  ... Mama?  Is that you?...~
@4397 = ~Oh, please, please!  (sob!)  I just want my Littleman!  (sob!)  Why did you take it!  ... Mama?  Mama, is that you?...~
@4398 = ~I've... I've gone to him...  (sob!)  ... I've tried to tell him that I just want my bear, please, but he just gets too frightened of me.  (sob!)  Oh, please get it from him!~
@4399 = ~... Mama?  Mama, do you know where my Littleman is?  Do you have him?~
@4400 = ~Yes, Wellyn... here is your bear.  You can go to sleep now.~
@4401 = ~You don't?  (sob!)  Oh... could you get him?  Could you get my stuffed bear, pleeeaaasse?~
@4402 = ~... Th-thank you, <SIRMAAM>...~
@4403 = ~... Mama?  Papa?  Is that you?  Do you have my Littleman?~
@4404 = ~(sob!)  Mama?  Is that you?  (sob!)  You're not my mama!  But... but you have my bear!  You have my Littleman!!~
@4405 = ~Oh, please... I cannot sleep without my Littleman!  Can I have him... can I have him, please?~
@4406 = ~This stuffed bear?  Er, certainly... here you go...~
@4407 = ~What?!  You won't give me my bear?!  You... you are so MEAN!!~
@4408 = ~Ahhhh... fleshling!  This is OUR land in the evening... this is no place for such as YOU!!~
@4409 = ~Aaah!  Oh... me pardons... I thought ye were that bloody ghost again...!~
@4410 = ~Oh, aye... unfortunately.  A, uh... ghost is sometimes hauntin' me.  Terrible, frightenin' thing, that is.~
@4411 = ~Well... yes it is.  How did you know that?~
@4412 = ~This ghost you mentioned... it wouldn't be a little halfling boy by the name of Wellyn, would it?~
@4413 = ~I am a, er... merchant of fine goods, me <LADYLORD>.  Pleased t' meet ye.  Now, if ye'll excuse me... ye are in my room...~
@4414 = ~Oh... er, I don't know.  Can't say for sure.  Excuse me, but this does be me private room... could ye please leave?~
@4415 = ~This ghost wouldn't be haunting you because it is a little boy you murdered and robbed, would it, hm?  Hand over his bear... now.~
@4416 = ~Alright, alright... I'm going.~
@4417 = ~You're... you're here to retrieve his... bear?  I, uh... I think I have it around here, somewhere.  Yes... let me take a look... ah, yes.  Here it is.~
@4418 = ~Give... give that to the little bloody bastard and tell him to stay away from me!~
@4419 = ~I'll spare your life... but don't let me catch you around here again!~
@4420 = ~What?!  How... how did you know about that?!  Well... you'll not take ME alive!!~
@4421 = ~Alright, alright... I'm going, I'm going... just let me collect me things, here...~
@4422 = ~Oh, it is, it is... I'll just collect me things and I'll be out o' yer hair...~
@4423 = ~Oh... it's you again... what is it ye want, now?~
@4424 = ~Our... our little boy is at peace, now.  He appeared to us to say good-bye, and told us that you had rescued his bear.  I... I thank you, my <LADYLORD>, you are very kind.~
@4425 = ~Yes, thank you so much.  (sniff!)  It is... such a relief.  Come, my husband... let us go home.~
@4426 = ~Oh... I am so happy that you have come back!~
@4427 = ~Oy, now!  What... what are you doin' sneakin' up on a fella in the middle o' the bleedin' night, aye?~
@4428 = ~You look like you're digging up that grave... what are you, some kind of graverobber?~
@4429 = ~Sorry... didn't mean to bother you.~
@4430 = ~Listen, here... you either cough up some money or I'll report you to the garrison.~
@4431 = ~I'm just diggin' up a bit o' buried treasure... hey, now.  Ye gives me the willies, ye does.  Ye're in league with the bleedin' garrison, ye are!!~
@4432 = ~No, I'm not... but I'll not allow you to commit this sacrilege!~
@4433 = ~Well... all right.  But make a move on, then, or ye'll be regrettin' it mighty soon.~
@4434 = ~Ho, citizen! On orders of the Council, I accuse you of crimes against Amn.~
@4435 = ~You're on the wrong side of the river here, friend. This is Shadow Thief territory and we can't have you committing monstrous crimes without our permission.~
@4436 = ~There may be such a woman... it could be that the answer to your question is playing itself out right now.~
@4437 = ~Jaheira, I don't care that... what? Glad? I thought you wanted this?~
@4438 = ~I am not in a mood to converse with madmen of the sewers. Back to your slime pit, old fool!~
@4439 = ~My one true companion, topsider.~
@4440 = ~No... I enjoy the excitement of this life.  Is that so hard to understand?~
@4441 = ~Well, think about it, then.  But do so silently... and let us continue our travels.~
@4442 = ~'Passing by?' Athkatla? I see. Well, thank you for... thank you for following me, even if you are only 'passing by.'~
@4443 = ~Then you do not know me well, <CHARNAME>.  I am unlike you all.  In some ways... if not all.~
@4444 = ~You remove the ring from the finger and it tingles in your palm. There is obviously something special about the ring.~
@4445 = ~Certainly.  If you wish to discuss nothing and have no conversation of any type... if you wish to remain an ignorant dalhar, I am only happy to oblige.~
@4446 = ~Notice the lack of Spectral Harpists? They were here at one time, and they would not leave their post unless it was no longer to be guarded.~
@4447 = ~True... but if that were not the case, you would consider such a thing natural, yes?  I have seen the custom borne out and cannot grasp the notion properly.~
@4448 = ~Those we kill in self-defense may look like Harper allies, even if they are not.  We have no choice, and I will not feel guilty over this tangled web any more.~
@4449 = ~Then we will go together. Rejoin and... and walk with me.~
@4450 = ~You are a cold and vicious woman, Viconia.~
@4451 = ~That sounds like an excuse.~
@4452 = ~You not know the glory of Crragtail! You stupid <RACE> of above, where sun causes rot and dryout! Down here all is moist and soft, and good throne!~
@4453 = ~Peeeyewww... rrrr...~
@4454 = ~I do not tolerate threats from creatures that live in filth!~
@4455 = ~Staff? You want Stick of Many Foods?! You not get! You come to steal greatest treasure of Crragtail empire! Better than Throne of Comfy, or Pipe That Smell Not Quite So Much!~
@4456 = ~RRaagh! Rrget yourr traitorrrr!!!!~
@4457 = ~I do not wish to diminish the glory of your rule, but how does 2,000 gold sound?~
@4458 = ~Grrrr... rrwha?~
@4459 = ~Ehh... how much you say? What wa' dat?~
@4460 = ~2,000 gold for the glory of your realm.~
@4461 = ~I was taunting you. I offer nothing! You live in a fool's realm!~
@4462 = ~Yeah, glory, whateverrrr. Stick yours. Have funs above.~
@4463 = ~Reaagh... wha?!!~
@4464 = ~Wha... RRRAAAGHHH!!~
@4465 = ~Yes, I intend to have power for myself.~
@4466 = ~You wish to have power, do you?  I... I think...~
@4467 = ~... I think it is disgusting that a lowly male would desire to rise so far past his place.  You are nothing like Shar or Lolth!~
@4468 = ~Ah, I see.  As I thought, you are yet the reticent coward.  You remind me of the lowly drow males, crawling along the ground on your belly with eyes downcast.~
@4469 = ~The undersea of Laratrak, for example, defies words.  To sail across takes two days luent to linoin... east to west... three days trezen to werneth... north to south.~
@4470 = ~Do not be a wael... a fool. I enjoyed it well enough; I killed for sport and necessity, but I took no pleasure in sacrifice solely to satiate her endless desire.~
@4471 = ~They took me to the orlenggin... the sacrificial altar... where a surfacer screamed in agony, and for the pleasure of Lolth I was given a spider dagger to end his life.~
@4472 = ~This human was but a kul'gobuss to me, but it felt wrong.  He was bare and chained... helpless.  His tears ran freely as he begged for mercy in his unfamiliar tongue.~
@4473 = ~There were... many sacrifices, were there?~
@4474 = ~It is the drow way.  But that is... behind me, now.  Let us continue our travels, <CHARNAME>.~
@4475 = ~My heart is filled with bile at these memories, at any rate.  Yes... yes, do let us move on.~
@4476 = ~He... he was no mere male!  Is it so difficult for you to believe that I might have cared for another, once?!~
@4477 = ~Yes.  Yes, he saved me.  I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I do not wish to continue discussing Valas.  Excuse me.~
@4478 = ~Our... our relationship was unusual, yes...~
@4479 = ~... I... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.  I do not wish to discuss Valas any further.  Excuse me.~
@4480 = ~There are normally no...'brothers', although some males are favored more than others.  Most simply exist to serve Queen and House, but this is... not always the case.~
@4481 = ~You mentioned your brother, before... he was a special case?~
@4482 = ~So I will fear no more. I... I value your company, <CHARNAME>. After all we have been through, I must know: do you value my company as well?~
@4483 = ~... of the party?  So, business alone has kept you with me.  Very well... Best I know now, before... Well, that is quite enough of that.  Let's go, shall we?~
@4484 = ~I won't delay us any longer for now. We will speak again on this, in better spirits, I hope.~
@4485 = ~Ah, the dawning of our day, though it is very rarely that we seem to match our sleep cycle to the day or night.~ [JAHEIRB1]
@4486 = ~Sunrises are but one of, oh, at least two things worth waking to I could think of.~
@4487 = ~Perhaps, though I intend no malice. I would laugh at you as I laugh at myself, and... hopefully I will come to know you that well.~
@4488 = ~No need to. No sunrise could compare with your beauty in the moonlight.~
@4489 = ~Stop.~ [JAHEIRB2]
@4490 = ~As you were 'forced' to deal with the Harpers that died in Athkatla?~
@4491 = ~The garish Hold, his political agenda; he was merely using the weight of the Harper name to promote himself. Tell me: what did he offer you?~
@4492 = ~Ah, but the events are not known. What is accepted is that you have killed your brethren and taken up with a known murderer. There is no evidence existing to the contrary.~
@4493 = ~One grows weary. We would have done good works, Jaheira, just from a more profitable perspective.~
@4494 = ~Innocent?! Is that what you call <CHARNAME>? But <PRO_HESHE> is a child of Bhaal! Whether his nature is good or bad it will certainly be disruptive!~
@4495 = ~Ah, your wit is still the most dangerous trait about you, Jaheira. I told you to cultivate it.  Little did I know I would be on the receiving end one day.~
@4496 = ~Heh, you and your jokes make me smile far too often, even when I do not want to. People will think I am getting soft.~
@4497 = ~Haha! Shush you! I'm supposed to be feeling bad about this whole thing. Oh, let's just get moving.~
@4498 = ~Nothing, though morale is going to slip if you keep glaring at people.~
@4499 = ~That's what I said but I meant... I'm sorry, I shouldn't need to play these games. I'm just so mad and I don't know how to get it out.~
@4500 = ~He put you in the position of opposing a mentor. It couldn't help but trouble you.~
@4501 = ~I need you to say... what? I don't know either. I'm sorry, this is not fair to you at all.~
@4502 = ~My brother, Valas, was an exception to the standard drow male.  He was my childhood friend... and perhaps my only friend, after all is said.~
@4503 = ~He... watched over me and protected me, and I ensured that the worst of the abuses that befell males did not strike him.~
@4504 = ~In the end... he saved my life.  He... prevented my sacrifice and killed our mother, giving me the opportunity to flee.~
@4505 = ~He... no longer exists.  <CHARNAME>... I am cold and tired and no longer in the mood to speak.  Excuse me.~
@4506 = ~(sigh)  Let us... just walk for a while in silence, <CHARNAME>.  I am no longer in the mood to talk.~
@4507 = ~So... where was I?  Oh, yes.  Your part in this.  I would like you to go to Mae'Var and join his guild.~
@4508 = ~Sometimes your self-righteous sense of judgement makes me ill to my stomach, <CHARNAME>.~
@4509 = ~Yes... so am I.  But... that does not mean she will never do so.  (sigh)  Come, <CHARNAME>... the road beckons.~
@4510 = ~Alright, fine, I'll stay for a moment.  By the gods, Viconia... you're shaking!  What is the matter?~
@4511 = ~Then begone, rath'arg... and leave me alone to my misery.~
@4512 = ~I... I dream of Valas, sometimes, and I try to speak to him in my dreams.  But he is only a monster, now, and I scream when his horrid spider legs caress me...~
@4513 = ~I think... what can Lolth do to me if she has done this to Valas?  What worse torments await me when she finally decides to come?!~
@4514 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am frightened to my very core!  Do not leave me alone!  Stay with me this night.  I... I need to feel your flesh next to mine, to embrace your strength...~
@4515 = ~It will mean... it will mean nothing.  Lolth's reach is far... and I fear there is no escaping it...~
@4516 = ~I do not wish to be cheerful; I wish to be miserable, hating everything that has led to what we are.~
@4517 = ~All right... I will stay with you, if that is what you wish.~
@4518 = ~Do not deny me this, <CHARNAME>... I offer to you all the pleasures that a drow woman may bestow if you but hold me this night.~
@4519 = ~I... do not doubt your ability, Viconia.  And you are beautiful.  But not like this, not in this manner...~
@4520 = ~Very well, Viconia... I shall stay with you this night if that is what you wish.~
@4521 = ~Viconia... not like this.  Not because you are desperate... it isn't right.~
@4522 = ~I do.  Come to my arms out of view of prying eyes... place your hand against my darkly trembling heart and I will show you the boundaries of passion as only I can...~
@4523 = ~Do not deny me, <CHARNAME>... and do not deny yourself.~
@4524 = ~My mother wished me to recant, to prostrate myself before the Spider Queen and beg forgiveness.  She was desperate that I do so, in fact.~
@4525 = ~What if they were the wrong ones? I have turned this over and over in my mind, and the dead have piled up and I have still gone forward.~
@4526 = ~She abandoned me, left me completely without power.  I had no brother, no power and House DeVir was, as far as I knew, falling.~
@4527 = ~Come, my children!  Fear the power of Talos!  Join us in reverent worship to avoid the disasters that are sure to strike us down in the days to come!~
@4528 = ~I thought Talos is an evil god... how is it that he is openly worshipped here?~
@4529 = ~I have heard a bit of Talos... tell me more.~
@4530 = ~I have heard that Lathander is a young and vain god... why would you grant him obeisance?~
@4531 = ~Lathander may be prone to the vagaries of youth but he has other gifts.  To serve the Morninglord is to strive for vitality and joy... what is wrong with that?~
@4532 = ~Bah! What does the heart know. It makes you do foolish things for no cause. It makes you forget the dead before you should. It makes you fall in...~
@4533 = ~It most certainly is, supplicant.  Enter our most sacred temple, and bask in the glory of the God of Dawns... experience His benevolence for yourself.~
@4534 = ~It... makes you do things that wreak havoc on your mind. I'm a sorry, <CHARNAME>, you should not have to hear this. You have been good and true.~
@4535 = ~I should be happy, but I am not. Even with all we have done to make things right, I am still troubled.~
@4536 = ~And arrogance will kill you. They thought they were right, and we think we are right. Is there so much of a difference?~
@4537 = ~You needn't keep a distance between us. I am in less of a mood now.~ [JAHEIRB5]
@4538 = ~Should I tailor my mood to yours? You have proven unresponsive in the past.~
@4539 = ~You have questioned our relationship at every step, even as you pursued it.~
@4540 = ~This is a place of the peaceful and divine... not for the likes of you.  Begone from here!~
@4541 = ~I do so worry what has become of the missing priests... there are so many who have disappeared it is a terrible concern!~
@4542 = ~I do not trust these preachers... what is this Unseeing Eye?  It sounds horrid... and they have all plucked out their own eyes!~
@4543 = ~I pay homage to all our gods, but I serve only Arvoreen.  One day I hope to be foremost among His holy swords.~
@4544 = ~Sometimes I feel as if the gods are testing me, little one... but overall, yes, they watch over me most kindly.~
@4545 = ~It just isn't fair... I donate coin to Lathander for prosperity and Helm for protection... and then the Talassans come and burn down my shop!~
@4546 = ~A merchant must cover all his bases and be wary to offend no god... it is a most trying existence!~
@4547 = ~I am trying. You have shown such caring so far. I have taken you for granted as someone that would always be here, even as I questioned our very friendship.~
@4548 = ~I will not make such a mistake again. Of this I am sure.~
@4549 = ~I have... had a realization. I have been walking with my eyes downcast for so long I had forgotten the beauty of the land. I... all we have seen; I had thought never to feel the warmth of nature again.~ [JAHEIRB6]
@4550 = ~You make me appreciate such things. I never appreciated a simple forest before you.~
@4551 = ~Do we not see nature in everything? Even in the deepest dungeons?~
@4552 = ~Oh, some days I am sure that the gods are all frowning on us.  Faerun is doomed!  Doomed!~
@4553 = ~There are beings of great power in the planes that are my home... but do you think that they really concern themselves so much with this one?  It strikes me as a barren fancy, really.~
@4554 = ~There's no rest fer the wicked, they says... so I plan on prayin' extra hard today, I does.~
@4555 = ~Pardon me fer a teeny bit o' blasphemy... but have ye seen the Morninglord's lasses as o' late?  Now I know what 'em priests says about rebirth, I does!~
@4556 = ~All these preachers about for this no-eyed god are a little creepy... I wonder what sins they absolve?~
@4557 = ~By Lathander's grace the entire city has prospered... it is only right that we lay down in devotion to Him.~
@4558 = ~The city is in dire straits with so many of the clergy disappearing... only to turn up as converts of this strange cult.  It isn't right!~
@4559 = ~By Lathander's grace... how can you bring one of those dark, evil things here into this part of the city?!~
@4560 = ~I'll walk where I like, rivvil... and you can take your petty religious slurs and throw them in the river, for all I care!~
@4561 = ~Why... that is the most darling little pet you have there, sir.~
@4562 = ~Boo is no pet... he is a fine companion for Minsc.  But he seems to like you anyway.~
@4563 = ~And I would stay by the brooks of home if I wished only my reflection. I would like to see some of myself in your face, but not so much that I lose what is you.~
@4564 = ~I must admit that Lathander seems to have the right idea... those gaudy, golden interiors are fit for a true King, if you ask me.~
@4565 = ~Ah, if it isn't Lord Valygar.  I am sorry, my lord... we still haven't built a temple to Mystra for your family, yet.~
@4566 = ~Oh, stop it. I'm being serious here.~
@4567 = ~You know very well, my lord, that I am no sorcerer... and nearly all of my family is well beyond the reach of your petty barbs!~
@4568 = ~I do not know what you mean... I have no plans to leave my gnomish lord Baervan Wildwanderer... I owe Him too much, sir.~
@4569 = ~She seems to be well enough remembered, here... but I thought her worship was no more.~
@4570 = ~Indeed!  In her time, Waukeen was known and welcomed fondly by all in the great City of Coin!  The Promenade was built to honor her and trade prospered throughout!~
@4571 = ~It is sad she disappeared from our lives... many of us still honor her.  I am confident that one day she will return and claim all the wealth that is rightfully hers.~
@4572 = ~Perhaps this changes nothing, perhaps everything. I don't care anymore. My heart cannot have nature within and be ashamed as well.~
@4573 = ~We have to be nearing our goal. It has been so long a journey and we've been through so much. I hope this does not end up all being for naught.~ [JAHEIRB7]
@4574 = ~I could not have come this far without you helping me, Jaheira.~
@4575 = ~There can be no mercy for this creature. What he has done is unforgivable.~
@4576 = ~Who knows, indeed. Yesterday saw friends die; saw blood spilled. Tomorrow...~
@4577 = ~I see. Then stay up and talk with me for a while. I doubt I shall sleep.~
@4578 = ~Perhaps we should take some time to talk.~
@4579 = ~Er... yes... yes, I am.  Why do you ask?~
@4580 = ~Ack!  I... are you sure?  I mean... I have no memory...~
@4581 = ~I... I see.  What is it exactly that you want?~
@4582 = ~Heh heh... oh, nothing, Talon Nirkhas.  A simple mistake, perhaps, on my part.  Please do excuse me.  (You are in SUCH trouble, girl!)~
@4583 = ~I see.  Talos' blessing on you, then, and... er... good day.~
@4584 = ~(ahem)  It is... not against my vows to drink the cups or sample the flesh of a willing woman.  We Talassans favor pleasure in the face of the destruction of the Stormlord.~
@4585 = ~Whew!  I am certainly glad that situation was not what it seemed!  There are many... ah... celebrations I have but hazy memories of!~
@4586 = ~What are... what are you looking at?  Nothing to see, here.~
@4587 = ~The child is mine... like she was the cleric's?  Or the gods know only how many other men's?~
@4588 = ~She is?  Er... how much do I owe you?~
@4589 = ~Oh, er... perhaps I was mistaken.  You look very similar to another I had... spent time with.  Excuse me, my lord.~
@4590 = ~I'll give you the money... for the little girl's sake if nothing else.~
@4591 = ~I am afraid you're barking up the wrong tree... I do not have that to give you.~
@4592 = ~Thank you, my lord.  My name, by the way, is Miranda... and this is your, um, daughter, Lanie.  We appreciate your dedication to duty and will see you anon, perhaps.~
@4593 = ~Not many would, I suppose.  She is a goddess of the halflings ... representing our ideals of friendship and trust.~
@4594 = ~As you might understand, it is important for us halflings to fit in wherever we can.  A home is a home... we may as well strive to make it a pleasant home.~
@4595 = ~Bah!  It is the end come upon us!  Many of our priests have disappeared... but some have returned to preach for this devil god!  Talos will take revenge!!~
@4596 = ~It is a good thing for Cyrando... he has such a way with words.  He is a good friend... and I am a poor excuse for a bard.  (sigh)~
@4597 = ~The foolishness of this Garrick fellow... does he think the Lady Irlana does not see through his ruse?~
@4598 = ~I am Sir Cadril, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.  Pleased to make your acquaintance, my <LADYLORD>.~
@4599 = ~If I e'er found a man who could speak as Garrick does, but with fluency and passion... then that man would have my heart, methinks.~
@4600 = ~Greetings to you, my <LADYLORD>.  I be Lady Irlana, Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.  At your service.~
@4601 = ~This foolish boy, Garrick, can barely take instruction... sometimes I think he barely has a thought in his head.~
@4602 = ~My heart goes out to the Lady Irlana... but this is as close a simple gnome such as I can ever hope to come to a noble beauty like her.~
@4603 = ~Now, that's not necessarily true, my friend.  My cousin Adecan married a fine human woman, he did.  He was of the sort that was not fine to look on, as well... but she did appreciate his sense of humor.~
@4604 = ~The lad could tell a joke to save his life, in fact.  Once kept a trio of ogres laughing so heartily that they forgot to eat him.  Too bad he didn't speak griffon, however... poor Adecan.  I hear his last joke was a zinger, although the punchline got cut short.~
@4605 = ~It has been a struggle of duty and honor, good friend... but the gods have treated me well, nevertheless, I think.~
@4606 = ~Ah... Anomen.  I see you are... back.~
@4607 = ~I am, Cadril.  And there is no reason for your furtive, suspicious glances, either... whether you like me or not.~
@4608 = ~Ah... Sir Keldorn!  How do you do?  I just spoke to Lady Maria this morning, in fact.~
@4609 = ~I... I see.  She is well?~
@4610 = ~Hmmmn... for some reason, you seem rather familiar, too, my dear.~
@4611 = ~You are a bard, man... look into the depths of your heart and draw from that well a potion that will please your lady.  Speak of things that will move a mountain by your passion and eloquence!  To do aught else would be to shame your profession.~
@4612 = ~Err... Garrick, isn't it?  What can I do for ye, Garrick?~
@4613 = ~I, uh... I, uh...~
@4614 = ~I am... here to pledge... to you the love... of a poet and an artist.  Take my fragile love, my... sweet, hold it in your... hands as a gaze upon you admiringly.  Er... yes, that's right...~
@4615 = ~Oh... I see.  Well, thank you, Garrick.~
@4616 = ~(Come with me, my lady and let me... ow!  damn insects!  Wait, fool, don't say that!)~
@4617 = ~Come with... me, my lady... and let me out damn insects!  No, you fool... don't, uh...~
@4618 = ~(Heh... you've got a prize, here, my lady.)~
@4619 = ~Um... excuse me for a moment...~
@4620 = ~Lady Irlana!  I wish to, uh, proclaim my undying love... for you.  Yes, for you!~
@4621 = ~(Patience, my lady... this could be amusing.)~
@4622 = ~Yes... ummm... okay...~
@4623 = ~Lady Irlana, I am... bedazzled by your... beauty and yawn-struck... by your nobility.  What... I would not to do... spend an evening... in your barns.~
@4624 = ~Arms, fool!  I, uh... I meant arms.  Yes, your arms.~
@4625 = ~Well... it's easy... I, uh...~
@4626 = ~(I can never truly be worthy of a true lady of virtue, my love... I only desire that you see past my faults and give me a chance!)~
@4627 = ~I can never... truly be worthy of a... blue lady of virtue..my love... I only desire you... that you see past... my faults and give... me pants!~
@4628 = ~Thank you, sir knight.  I am most fond of the Lady Irlana... and am pleased that she was able to accept love from a simple gnome such as myself.~
@4629 = ~Yes, well, congratulations, again.  And farewell to you both, for now... I shall see you on your return.~
@4630 = ~Thank you, Sir Cadril... I shall see you soon.~
@4631 = ~No, I'm sorry, I don't have a reason to speak with you.~
@4632 = ~Do not attempt to render judgement on my mind, imbecile!  Just... leave me be!  Let me scour the stain of your touch from me... and be done with it!~
@4633 = ~Bah!  Do not attempt to look into my mind and render judgement, imbecile!  You haven't the strength or the knowledge!  Just... leave me be!~
@4634 = ~You nauseate me, <CHARNAME>... is that not reason enough?  I look upon you and I see something that I would rather squish under my boot!~
@4635 = ~I am telling you that I have had rivvin by the dozens, that I allowed their saliva to cover me, allowed them to use me for their pleasures!!  And I enjoyed it!!~
@4636 = ~Finally you show some sense!  I am drow, foolish jaluk... never forget that!  Jal khaless zhah waela!~
@4637 = ~You would not let me repel you, no matter how I tried.  I am defeated by your stubborn will and strange regard.  My need is real, <CHARNAME>... stay with me tonight.~
@4638 = ~I'm sorry, Viconia.  I think it is best if this relationship does not continue... it will never work out.~
@4639 = ~Very well... I shall.~
@4640 = ~Very well, Viconia... I shall stay with you.~
@4641 = ~Come to me, then, my mrann d'ssinss.  You have defeated me... now taste your victory...~
@4642 = ~I... I am lucky, <CHARNAME>, to have found you on the surface.  To think that I would need to come so far, to such an alien place, to find someone that I could... trust.~
@4643 = ~You are not so terrible, <CHARNAME>... for a male.~
@4644 = ~And you are not so terrible... for a drow.~
@4645 = ~I think I understand what you mean, Viconia... and I thank you.~
@4646 = ~This must not come to pass. The everseeing eye of Helm must be made aware of what they intend.~ [OISIGX02]
@4647 = ~Do not pout so, <CHARNAME>.  I meant no barb by it.  This is unfamiliar territory for me, as a drow... although, with you, it does not seem so bad as it once did.~
@4648 = ~There you are. I knew you would come. You have the look of a servant of what is right, a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of good faith and charity.~
@4649 = ~The illithid mind is a stranger landscape still.  Their main goal is dominance of others... and they believe that life with the elder brain is the highest form of being.~
@4650 = ~That, and the delight they seem to get from cracking open your skull like a hen's egg and drinking everything swimming inside your head...~
@4651 = ~The Kuo-Toa will trade, but negotiations are fraught with danger.  No one Kuo-Toan settlement is the same as the next... they are unstable and prone to profound suspicion.~
@4652 = ~Do not assume kinship solely on appearance. I will decide my alliances.~
@4653 = ~This prophet preyed on the people's need for security. Can you not offer this?~
@4654 = ~Fathers do not exist as you know it.  The males service the matron of the house when she wishes to conceive... or when she desires pleasure.~
@4655 = ~Welcome to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, young <MANWOMAN>.  I am Prelate Wessalen.  Walk always on the path of justice, honor, and duty.~
@4656 = ~Amongst the Drow, cruelty and pain are both armor and shield.  It makes us deadly... Lolth encourages competition and rivalry to keep us strong.~
@4657 = ~As an adult, he was a useful wizard... and amused my mother enough that she did not sell him into slavery.~
@4658 = ~And I certainly did not expect him to... do what he did.  Knowing that he would have to pay the price.~
@4659 = ~Because she never forgives a trespass.  She keeps a frightening thrall over her sect... visiting from the Demonweb as often as a peasant visits the greengrocer.~
@4660 = ~It is because I have seen, because I have felt the lash of tentacle rods, that she will... will leave me to think I am safe or free and then she will come for me.~
@4661 = ~I... have a need, <CHARNAME>.  A need that must be fulfilled... I must feel your strength within me and around me.~
@4662 = ~'Allo there, pally. I'm Squire Melvin. It's nice t' meet ya.~
@4663 = ~Are you aware that, despite our intimacies, I know little of you other than the usual graces?  You've mysteries in you... and secrets.  That face holds tales in its creases.~ [VICONI96]
@4664 = ~We have information that the core of their worshippers are underground and relatively close, though our scrying has only allowed us to see as far as the sewers.~
@4665 = ~Imoen... was then and is now.  She's my closest friend.~
@4666 = ~Gorion... a wise man, good teacher and greater friend.~
@4667 = ~What is the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart?~
@4668 = ~Then ask nothing more. I will follow into the depths and return with answers.~
@4669 = ~And what is the reward? I am a <MANWOMAN> of faith, but I must eat as well.~
@4670 = ~Err... I change my mind. I won't anger a deity, especially if it involves the sewers.~
@4671 = ~'Tis an order o' paladins 'n such. Truth, justice, honor, and courage, ye knows.~
@4672 = ~Well, good luck, Melvin.~
@4673 = ~Aye, ya gots a fine look about ya.~
@4674 = ~I'm not sure... I was hoping on being somewhere with you, however.~
@4675 = ~I apologize Viconia... I just didn't expect this from you.~
@4676 = ~It's a pleasurable enough diversion, Viconia, but nothing beyond that.~
@4677 = ~Feh, it is little more than idle fantasy, really.  It is good to see that you have a little desire however... perhaps that is something I can work on, hm?~
@4678 = ~May the Morninglord's Dawn find you ever renewed, my friend.~
@4679 = ~I may be tired, but I look forward to showing the arts I learned as a Drow.  I hold a degree of... affection... for you, <CHARNAME>.  How else am I supposed to show this?~
@4680 = ~Hmm.  An odd thing to say.  If I had no male to service me in the Underdark I slept alone.  I am... unfamiliar with this.  How else would you show... affection?~
@4681 = ~Here... let us hold each other tonight, only, and I will show you.~
@4682 = ~As you wish, my mrann d'ssinss... come into my arms and let me show you but a small portion of the drow's vast knowledge of the art of massage...~
@4683 = ~As... as you wish, <CHARNAME>.  I feel uncomfortable with this arrangement, but I suppose that... that some rest is not uncalled-for.~
@4684 = ~Is it... is it time to awaken already?~ [VICONI99]
@4685 = ~I must admit, <CHARNAME>, that I slept more deeply that I have in some time.  I have not felt safer in... a long time... than I did in your arms.  A unique experience.~
@4686 = ~No... it was more than that.  I thank you for your... consideration.~
@4687 = ~I am going to ask you to do something that I would not ask of any but the bravest of the faithful. This beast must be destroyed.~
@4688 = ~I... I have nothing... nothing to answer that with, <CHARNAME>.  Thank you for your... consideration.~
@4689 = ~You are awake, I see.  That is good.  I have been watching you for some time... thinking.  I wish to share my thoughts with you.~ [VICONIA1]
@4690 = ~I know this is not your intention.  You have given me... protection, trust and a fair amount of affection, I would think.  I am too proud to continue in this vein.~
@4691 = ~Are you sure about this?  I... have deep feelings for you, Viconia.  I would not want you to waste what could be.~
@4692 = ~To your reward then, for you have performed admirably. You are to receive the greatest gift that we can bestow, one that transcends mere coin or purse.~
@4693 = ~Do not crawl like an infant, fool.  Your mewling churns my stomach.  Desist and we both rest easier.  Let us just continue our travels, <CHARNAME>... I much prefer that.~
@4694 = ~I am sure, <CHARNAME>.  You and I know there is nothing that 'could be'.  It is ended cleanly... so let us continue on our travels without further argument.~
@4695 = ~In this there is allegiance. Your faith is aligned as ours, though it lacks direction.~
@4696 = ~No... that's fine.  Stay, if you must.~
@4697 = ~Very well, I shall stay.  But take your pathetic eyes from me... and let us continue our travels.~
@4698 = ~I have... I have an odd feeling.  I do not... think... I have ever felt like this before...~ [VICONIA2]
@4699 = ~I will not be patronized by you, you idiot jaluk!  Next time you have something smart to say, shove your head underwater before I do it for you!~
@4700 = ~I am not sure.  As drow, we grow to have a natural tendency to feel rock... and to feel magic... and this has similarities of both within it...~
@4701 = ~It is almost as if a dark whisper is traveling over Faerun, searching, seeking out... something.  I... fear it is looking for me.~
@4702 = ~Consider always the consequences of your actions so that the least effort may bring the greatest and best reward.~
@4703 = ~Wherever you go, sow seeds of plants, tend the growing things you find, and plant seeds of hope, new ideas, and plans for a rosy future in the minds of all.~
@4704 = ~It... it has the stink of Lolth.  She is spinning her web, <CHARNAME>... she is looking for me.  Why now?  Why?!~
@4705 = ~It... no... there it goes.  The feeling... has vanished.  But that does not mean it will not return.  I... I am suddenly quite cold, inside...~
@4706 = ~Do not worry, Viconia... I am here to protect you.~
@4707 = ~Forget about it, Viconia... there is nothing that can be done.~
@4708 = ~Perhaps... you are right, <CHARNAME>.  I am ill at ease, however.  If my fears prove to be true, this may be the end of me.  I suppose I shall see... when and if it comes.~
@4709 = ~That... feeling!  It is back again, but stronger this time!  I can feel the ripples of the dweomer... black whispers from the depths of the Abyss!!  She has found me!  SHE HAS FOUND ME!!~ [VICONIA3]
@4710 = ~It... it's inside my head!  IT'S INSIDE MY HEAD!!~
@4711 = ~There is the strayed one!  Gather her, rothe... and kill the others!!~
@4712 = ~Ooooh... that sort of psychic rape by a hound from the depths of the abyss is the sort that I simply will not tolerate!  My head feels as if it is barely connected to my body...~ [VICONIA4]
@4713 = ~I understand that you have saved me, and I am appreciative.  The alternative would have been... unthinkable.  I am just... a little disoriented...~
@4714 = ~They were handmaidens of Lolth, one a yochlol: a handmaiden from the Abyss.  Gated assassins.  To think that she would go to such efforts to gather me up, it is almost beyond belief.~
@4715 = ~And... what will she do to take me, next?  The Spider Queen is not so easily dissuaded.  <CHARNAME>, I despise this terror that threatens to swallow me!~
@4716 = ~Easily and bravely said, <CHARNAME>... but Lolth is no creature to be trifled with.  I... I must think.  Please, leave me be for a while...~
@4717 = ~I am calm, foolish male... but my fear is justified... the Spider Queen is a thing to be feared!  I... I must think, <CHARNAME>.  Please, leave me be for a while...~
@4718 = ~Do?  I... I do not know.  I must think, <CHARNAME>... please, leave me be for but a while...~
@4719 = ~Yes, leave... find some way to save yourself, but I won't have you endangering me or the others!~
@4720 = ~No.  Stay here... it is the safest place for you.  We will find a way around this.~
@4721 = ~You cast me out?!  I should have known it would come to this!  All trust... is foolish!  Darkness take you, <CHARNAME>, I shall pray for your destruction forever!!~
@4722 = ~I... do not know if there is a way around this.  I... please let me think on this, <CHARNAME>... leave me be for a while...~
@4723 = ~Welcome. I had hoped you would come. You bear the signs of one that is good of heart, but that also gives weight to all sides of an argument.~
@4724 = ~You... you are an affront to me... I wish this had never come to be!~
@4725 = ~To the deepest pit of the abyss with my promise!  I shall do as I like, you ignorant male!!  I... you are an affront to me!  I... I wish... this had... never been!!~
@4726 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>!  This is... easier... for us both, in the end.  Begone with you and your ilk, I pray that we never meet again!!~
@4727 = ~I... I... just... leave me be, <CHARNAME>!  Just leave me be!!~
@4728 = ~We... we must talk.~ [VICONIA6]
@4729 = ~This... is not working... between us.  It will never work, and I think you know this.  There can be only one outcome.  It can only end poorly.~
@4730 = ~Love?  What is this love?  What can it do?  Your love will not be enough for us... it cannot provide us a future.  You know it is the truth~
@4731 = ~Sooner or later I will fail you, or you will fail me, or Lolth will capture me, or I will cause your death.  I am Drow and you are not... there is no happy ending here.~
@4732 = ~We must poison our hearts, my ssinssrigg... we must do what is necessary and cleave us apart before it is too late.  And I cannot stay.~
@4733 = ~I thank you, my ssinssrigg... you have shown me something I did not think to find, especially here on the surface.  You touched my black soul and I will be forever grateful.~
@4734 = ~If he is lying, then whatever cult he is proposing can only serve to hurt those it bilks into following him.~
@4735 = ~Aluve' ussta mzilst ssin'urn ultrin... farewell, my most handsome conqueror.  Until we meet again.~
@4736 = ~Nothing points to the emergence of a new deity. It would be impossible to hide such an event from the Great Guard that is Helm.~
@4737 = ~I... am sorry, Viconia.  If only there were some way for you to stay...~
@4738 = ~... I love you, too, <CHARNAME>... in my fashion.~
@4739 = ~Err... I changed my mind. I won't anger a deity, especially if it involves the sewers.~
@4740 = ~I... I regret I am not a creature who can feel things as you do.  The capacity... is just not within.  I almost wish it was, but darkness and loss are my callings... Shar knows only too well.~
@4741 = ~Hmm. Your refusal is displeasing. Know that Helm frowns upon you, and will do so until you change your course.~
@4742 = ~You have a clear duty here. A lesser <MANWOMAN> might shrink from this, but you must not. The disorder the beast will bring is to be stopped.~
@4743 = ~You are granted a place in Helm's sight. You are aligned with many of us, though you lack direction.~
@4744 = ~Then know the duties: you must be vigilant, fair and diligent. Protect the weak, the unpopular, the injured, and the young. Do not sacrifice them for others.~
@4745 = ~If there's something that ye be wantin', say so quickly.  Delosar's be a busy place and I be always short-staffed... I have little time even for ye.~
@4746 = ~No trouble at all. The door is back the way you came.~
@4747 = ~I hear that the halfling fellow went a built a bloody theater out of his cellar.  all th' power to 'im, but most folk I know are only interested in drink.  Good thing 'at is, too.~
@4748 = ~I'm sorry... I can be no help to you, my <LADYLORD>.  I'm just about run off me feet as it is!~
@4749 = ~This whole business with the murders is unsettling... but I feel a little safer with all the guards here, even if they be addled with wine.~
@4750 = ~I be glad that the murders be over with... but now the constant irritations of the guards is almost too much to bear!~
@4751 = ~You can't be speaking to me... I haven't been called that in ages...~
@4752 = ~That... your goods do NOT work!!  You stole my money, you did!~
@4753 = ~Er... alright... fair enough... on yer way, then...~
@4754 = ~And what is it you wish of me?~
@4755 = ~And a lovely job you do.~
@4756 = ~Be wary of those mercenaries from Riatavin upstairs... Dennis and his fellows are e'er up to no good.  We'll get them, eventually.~
@4757 = ~You there... I recognize you, I think.  Watch your step around here, thief.~
@4758 = ~(hic)  Don' mind me, there... citishen...~
@4759 = ~I... <hic>  I... I am the law!  <hic>  I think...~
@4760 = ~The artist is known as Sir Sarles, and he is making an all-too-brief visit. We would be foolish not to seize upon the opportunity to have him work for us.~
@4761 = ~You!  <hic>  You're comin' wish me... to me room... or you're under arresht...  <hic>~
@4762 = ~Pay for what you must and barter for his service as best you can. Do not stoop to underhanded means... he is worth his coin regardless of the price.~
@4763 = ~I been to the New World city o' Ulatos, mate... off west in Maztica.  The governor, there, does treat the natives harshly... It will come to violence soon, I fear.~
@4764 = ~Joy of joys, this morning is a bright one indeed! You have done it, and work has begun already! I cannot thank you enough, and neither can the church itself!~
@4765 = ~Aye, I have heard of such.  The priests of Helm in New Waterdeep object strenuously... although I hear nothing has changed.~
@4766 = ~Your reward then. You have earned a portion of the artist's commission, which should cover any costs you incurred quite nicely.~

@4768 = ~I be in some need of assistance, me <LADYLORD>.  There be a fellow within Delosar's Inn, there... Dennis.  He owes me a good deal of coin, an' refuses to pay!~
@4769 = ~He promised to pay off me bartab, he did, in exchange for some lessons on the gong.  Well, I teached him, I did... an' now he refuses to pay me tab!~
@4770 = ~Er... gong lessons?  Are you serious?~
@4771 = ~I've no interest in getting into a fight... find someone else to help you out.~
@4772 = ~The gong be a fine instrument... and it be used in many a rite here in the City o' Coin, me <LADYLORD>... we honors all the gods for business deals, we does.  An' besides... it sounds pleasant.~
@4773 = ~I be a poor, poor man, me <LADYLORD>... I have almost nothing to offer ye.  I beg of ye to help a destitute teacher find some justice!~
@4774 = ~Aaaah, yer a fine and noble <GIRLBOY>, ye are.  Come... follow me inside o' Delosar's and let's have a little talk wi' Dennis, aye?  I do believe he is on the second floor.~
@4775 = ~Certainly... let's go and talk to this Dennis fellow, now.~
@4776 = ~I be Dennis... the leader of my mercenary fellows here out o' Riatavin.  If you want to keep yer face on straight, you'll stay well clear of us.~
@4777 = ~Fine... so long as you steer clear of me.~
@4778 = ~I have plenty of ale, and so do my soldiers.  Last time, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... step back and go away.~
@4779 = ~Well, if you're going to be rude about it, I'll go... just keep clear of me.~
@4780 = ~Are you trying to be funny?  I suggest you apologize, little <PRO_GIRLBOY>, before things get... heated.~
@4781 = ~Oy, Dennis, ye mealy-faced sack o' suet!  Ye owes me th' coin for me bartab!  Pay up or ye'll surely face the consequences!!~ [LOUT02]
@4782 = ~Don't threaten me, you sorry excuse for a thief... I owe you nothing!~ [LOUTCA02]
@4783 = ~You've a nerve, drunkard!  You took my sweet mother's gong!  You stole it and traded it for ale, didn't you?!  Didn't you?!~
@4784 = ~... Oh, er... now, I had actually gone an' forgotten about that...~
@4785 = ~... I'll just be on me way, then...~
@4786 = ~Um... me <LADYLORD>?  Some... assistance?~
@4787 = ~You'll not restrain this man, Dennis... not while I'm here.~
@4788 = ~Sorry, Vittorio... you're on your own.~
@4789 = ~Well... I, uh...~
@4790 = ~He did.  The gong belonged to my mother... it was her dowry and worth a great deal of coin.  This damnable lout, here, stole it before my lessons were even finished!~
@4791 = ~... Well, I, um... I may be able to help with that...?~
@4792 = ~... My <LADYLORD>?  Would it be too much to ask for you to... um... find this gong for... this gentleman?~
@4793 = ~I... I sold it, I did.  To a fence by the name o' Roger... he has 'is hideout in the sewers.  I... don't know where, exactly... but it were sold not long ago.  He could still have it, he could!~
@4794 = ~Fine.  Do what you want... it's got nothing to do with me.~
@4795 = ~That's it, Vittorio... either cough up my gong right now... or you are a dead drunk...~
@4796 = ~(gulp!)  ... I, I see...~
@4797 = ~Listen... I know that you're not really involved in this.  But I do want my mother's gong back.  If you get it for me, I'll not only consider Vittorio's debt even, I'll make it worth your while.~
@4798 = ~I've a few items of potent magic that are worth plenty if you were to sell them... I'd be willing to part with one for the gong returned.  What say you?~
@4799 = ~Well, Vittorio... I guess it's just you and me, now.  I guess since you don't have the gong... the price is coming out of your hide!~
@4800 = ~... p-please, me <LADYLORD>!  I beg of you!  Have mercy!~
@4801 = ~Alright.  Fine.  I'll see if I can locate this gong... if I have the time.~
@4802 = ~... NO!  PLEAAASSE!!~
@4803 = ~I... er... I thank ye, me <LADYLORD>!  I be most grateful!  Er... I think I should be going, now...~
@4804 = ~A fine good business to ye, me <LADYLORD>.  I just wanted to thank ye fer handlin' that Dennis fella in th' pub... a fine bit o' justice, that were.~
@4805 = ~... er, I do so hope ye finds the gong soon, me <LADYLORD>...~
@4806 = ~Well, Vittorio... I suppose that means your time has ran out, hasn't it?~
@4807 = ~I have no intention of continuing the search... but nor will I allow you to touch this man, Dennis!~
@4808 = ~I sold it to a fence by the name of Roger not too long ago, I do think.  He... lives in the sewers below th' city, although I knows not exactly where.  He... he should still have it...~
@4809 = ~... My thanks, me <LADYLORD>... yer a kind one...~
@4810 = ~So... you haven't found it, yet.  Does this mean that you no longer intend to look?~
@4811 = ~That's correct... but nor will I allow you to touch this man, Dennis!  You'll release him at once!~
@4812 = ~You have the gong?  Excellent.  Mother will be very pleased.  As I promised, here is your reward... it should fetch an excellent price, unless you find another use for it.~
@4813 = ~And you, Vittorio... you can go.  But I warn you to stay out of my way... I don't even want to hear your name, you foul drunkard!~
@4814 = ~... There is... there is just th' wee little matter of me bartab...?~
@4815 = ~Grrr.  You've got gall.  But... I suppose I've got my gong.  I'll pay half of your tab, fool.  Now get out.~
@4816 = ~Y-yes, yes, of course.  And thank ye, me <LADYLORD>... I am most appreciative!  You are so kind!~
@4817 = ~Ye has the gong!  Oh, thank ye, thank ye truly!  Er... Dennis... the good <LADYLORD> has the gong...?~
@4818 = ~Wh... what?  That gong you have!  That is my mother's gong!  How did you get that?!  Give it to me immediately!!~
@4819 = ~It's yours?  Very well, I have little enough use for it... here you go.~
@4820 = ~My thanks!  I have been looking for this ever since that drunken lout stole it!  Here... take this magic item as a reward... it will fetch you a fair price if you wish to sell it.~
@4821 = ~Hmmm... I suppose I could do that.  Here... I have 500 gold pieces.  That's a fair price for the gong... I'll not offer a copper more.~
@4822 = ~Then I'll take it from your dead body!  Men... attack!!~
@4823 = ~Oh, you must be the messengers come to beg the service of Sir Sarles. It's a great honor to be refused by him, so don't feel bad when you leave empty-handed.~
@4824 = ~Riatavin, to the far south, is rebelling against the Council... we be mercenaries hired to fight against Lady Aura and her kin.~
@4825 = ~I am the mage of this mercenary troupe... I get paid well, and I'll thank you to leave me be.~
@4826 = ~It matters not that Riatavin has petitioned to join Tethyr... their rebellion will not succeed.  We shall crush them.~
@4827 = ~The Cowled Wizards do not prevent mages from operating with the army... or with mercenaries.  Especially mages of my skill.~
@4828 = ~Helm has sent me forth. His everseeing eyes wish to gaze upon your work.~
@4829 = ~Our fight against the town of Riatavin has been blessed by the gods... we shall surely prevail.~
@4830 = ~I am the priest and healer of this mercenary group.  I am their spirit and arm of faith... and I can battle as well as any of the men.~
@4831 = ~Hmmn.  I don't remember seeing you down here before.  New customers, perhaps?  Me name be Roger.  Is there something that you... need?~
@4832 = ~Yes, you will be gaining the favor of a powerful faith.~
@4833 = ~Oh... odds and ends, mostly.  I buy things from people who acquire things, and I don't ask where they acquire them from.  And then I sell them to others.  A redistribution of goods.~
@4834 = ~No, what I need has not changed, and I have said so to your masters. The gold offered is sufficient, and I am just fine without the flattery.~
@4835 = ~You are told? Have you not checked? Gathering the materials is not the job of a fine artist such as myself. Go speak with an ore merchant or somesuch.~
@4836 = ~I recall the name of one that was referred to me on my last visit. Jerlia was her name, I believe. Speak with her. She has exotics occasionally. Try the Promenade.~
@4837 = ~Alright, then.  Remember... you haven't seen me, aye?~
@4838 = ~What are you?  Some kind of crime-fighter that scours the sewers?  I be mindin' me own business, and that's all it is... business.  If ye has a problem with it, then be on yer way.~
@4839 = ~I'll be leaving, then... I've no interest in doing business with you.~
@4840 = ~You have heard my conditions of service. Provide what I wish or I will not work for you. Check the Promenade if you seek an ore merchant.~
@4841 = ~Well, I did not expect to see you back here so soon. Perhaps next time I should request to work only in blood-forged meteoric adamantite.~
@4842 = ~I suppose I could part with a few coins for the deed.  I tell you what... dispose of the sea troll beastie for me an' I'll be pleased to pay you 500 gold pieces, aye?~
@4843 = ~I thank you on behalf of the followers of Talos.~
@4844 = ~Our business is concluded. The piece will be delivered when it is done. I will dispatch a messenger to collect my fee and tell your church of my decision.~ [SARLES07]
@4845 = ~How about rewarding me with something... say, a gong?~
@4846 = ~Ahhh, I see.  Well, I'll tell you what... do a little favor for me and I'll tell you who I sold that particular gong to, as well as where you can find 'em, aye?~
@4847 = ~I sold it, through an envoy, to a troll shaman.  Errr... Grae, I believe her name to be.  Lives in a troll mound near Trademeet, ye can't miss it.~
@4848 = ~I can't imagine she's the type to receive visitors... an' I believe the mound to be guarded by trolls a'plenty.  But if ye want it, that's where it'd be.~
@4849 = ~Heh heh.  Looking for a reward, are we?  Well, I can't say that it isn't deserved.  Here... I have a few spare coins.  250 of them, all told.  Thank ye kindly for the deed.~
@4850 = ~Get rid o' the beastie that has been plaguing me about here... the sea troll t' be specific... an' I'll be pleased to tell you all I know.  Aye?~
@4851 = ~Ach, calm down, mate.  You don't frighten me... I've dealt with harsher types then you.  And besides... harming me won't find you out where the gong lies, now, will it?~
@4852 = ~Actually, it's not that important to me... I'd much rather just kill you!~
@4853 = ~(gulp)  er... how about I just start RUNNING FOR MY LIFE!!~
@4854 = ~Well hello to you again, mate.  I still notice that the beastie is runnin' around, yet... are you not plannin' on finishing our deal?~
@4855 = ~No, no... I'll go back and finish the job.~
@4856 = ~That's right... I've no interest in continuing this task.~
@4857 = ~An excellent job, mate!  Finally, my stores will be plenty safe from that troll's bug-eyed intrusions.  Now, then... what was it, again, that you were lookin' for as a reward?~
@4858 = ~He's in disguise. His kind doesn't look all that different, and as long as he's left alone, he's fine. Not a bad guy, once you get to know him.~
@4859 = ~Err... 1,000 gold pieces.~
@4860 = ~Did I promise that?  Well, mate, here you go... an' a thanks to you for a deed well done.  Anything ye need in the future, don't be hesitating to look me up.~
@4861 = ~Heh... you must be thinkin' me mighty stupid, mate.  If I remember right, I offered you 500 gold pieces.  An' here it is... no need to be greedy, aye?~
@4862 = ~Ahhh... always good to speak to you, mate.  What is it, exactly, that you need?~
@4863 = ~Ye be lookin' a mite out o' place, <GIRLBOY>.  What brings ye above yer station?  Found a gold mine?~
@4864 = ~We seek a valuable gong that was sold to you by a fence in Amn... tell us where it is!~
@4865 = ~Bonny good luck, then!~
@4866 = ~Now the bastards fawn over me but horribly, all the while eyeing me purse.~
@4867 = ~(hissss)  Wait!  (gasp!)  I... I will tell you where the gong is!  Mercy, humans!~
@4868 = ~(hissss)  The gong... I sold it to Drush... an ogre mage.  In the tower to the northeast, beside the house of the witch. He is gone but said he would return today.~
@4869 = ~If this could ruin you, I should offer no less than 1,000 gold.~
@4870 = ~(hissss)  You are... honorable?  I... I must flee!~
@4871 = ~Yes, we come in peace... why are you not attacking us?~
@4872 = ~That depends... what are your intentions?~
@4873 = ~Actually... I'm looking for a particular gong.  Grae the troll shaman supposedly sold it to you.~
@4874 = ~No reason... I'll be on my way.~
@4875 = ~Blasted, vile, ignorant humanoids!  Very well, then... feel my wrath!!~
@4876 = ~As you wish, humanoids.  You are welcome here at any time, so long as your intentions are peaceful... perhaps I will see you once again.~
@4877 = ~I see.  My kin have been here since the time of Umar... ever since then, the humans have come farther and farther out into these lands.  Perhaps I should move on, soon.  It is something to consider.~
@4878 = ~Feel free to make yourselves at home... although I know that humanoids do not often find ogre tastes appealing.  I would ask that you not steal anything, but beyond that you are welcome.~
@4879 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot give this information out without compensation.~
@4880 = ~A gong?  Oh... that.  Well, yes, I do have that... I saw it the last time I made a visit to the troll mound and thought it was of an adequate size to shovel cow dung.  What do you need with it?~
@4881 = ~It sounds like the end of me for a mere pittance. No, that is not enough.~
@4882 = ~Do not concern yourself with our reasons... the fact is that we wish to have the gong.~
@4883 = ~Very well, I will offer 1,000 gold to compensate you.~
@4884 = ~Forget it!  Give me the gong, now... or else!~
@4885 = ~I happen to have one, here... let's trade.~
@4886 = ~Hmmn... yes, this will do just fine.  Here is the gong.  Thank you.  Um... sorry for the smell on the gong... can't be helped. Ol' Bessie here has a... problem...~
@4887 = ~Hmph.  I don't know... where do you humanoids normally get such things?  Do they not sell them in your cities?  I am not an expert at your ways.~
@4888 = ~It is your custom, humanoids, to perform trade... is it not?  I use this gong, even if it is not for something important.  I expect something in return if I am going to give it up.~
@4889 = ~Yes, I have.  Here... let's trade.~
@4890 = ~No... but you're going to give me that gong... right NOW.~
@4891 = ~No... but I'm going to keep looking.~
@4892 = ~Greetings, humanoid.  Make yourself welcome, as I have said earlier.  Please excuse me, however... I am quite busy at the moment.~
@4893 = ~I don't understand... why aren't you attacking me?~
@4894 = ~No... I'll be on my way.~
@4895 = ~Greetings to you, my <BROTHERSISTER>, and welcome to a refuge for the suffering and those in need.  Ilmater offers shelter and healing to all who desire it... what is it that I can do for you?~
@4896 = ~Of course, my <BROTHERSISTER>... please come with me.~
@4897 = ~As you can see, there is much call for the Crying God's compassion here in Athkatla.  We would ask that you give, if you can afford... if not, it is no matter.~
@4898 = ~Have you seen the theater at the Five Flagons?  I hear the troupe, there, puts on quite an excellent show.~
@4899 = ~I hear there's been several kidnappings within the last few months... and none of them ever turned up, even though the ransom was paid!~
@4900 = ~The weather's been quite foul over the last few weeks... storms, hail and fog a'plenty.  It's a wonder we get any sea traffic at all.~
@4901 = ~It is called the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, fool.  And we do more to battle evil than you could comprehend.  Look to your own actions, first, before you look to others'.~
@4902 = ~My goodness... so many men in uniforms, here, I hardly know where to start!~
@4903 = ~Mmmm... you, there... you're a Thayvian, aren't you?  I've heard some very good things about the men from Thay...~
@4904 = ~Heh.  There do be certain advantages to possessing a smaller stature... foremost among them be easier access to the honeypot pleasures of the female.  Heh heh.~
@4905 = ~(mumble) ... Mmm... where be the l'il serving wench?...~
@4906 = ~(mumble)  ... Eh?  Who be you?  You nar be me wife, are ye?...  (shudder)  ... I nay'er want t' see that battleaxe tonight, aye?...~
@4907 = ~(mumble)  ... Have a seat if ye likes...~
@4908 = ~(mumble)  ... Buy me an ale, aye?...~
@4909 = ~Ew... a commoner peasant!  Out, out at once!!~
@4910 = ~Excuse me, my <LADYLORD>... but this IS our room you are intruding into?  I would request that you leave.~
@4911 = ~Oh, it's not so bad now, is it? You've got a close approximation of what you need, and I have fair compensation for the demand on the item.~
@4912 = ~Hmm... you wouldn't be the room service, would you?~
@4913 = ~The price for that knowledge is 1,000 gold. Do you wish to pay that instead?~
@4914 = ~Tsk, tsk. Not even a challenge anymore. The big folk are getting more than a little inbred.~
@4915 = ~Perhaps I should just ask about your source. That was 1,000 gold, wasn't it?~
@4916 = ~Why, hello there... so nice to see someone of decent culture in this little horrid inn.  Too bad we have no servants with us to host you properly.~
@4917 = ~Ah... if you are one of the servants, I would like a cup of elven wine, please.  And perhaps a bit of pheasant, too... I'm feeling peckish.~
@4918 = ~I have no home but th' mud in th' streets... except that I am allowed t' stay in the temple, sometimes.~
@4919 = ~Please, me <LADYLORD>... could ye spare a bit o' coin for a sinner in need?  Please... but a single coin would do!~
@4920 = ~I... understand, my <LADYLORD>.  Go in peace wi' ye.~
@4921 = ~Then your unkindness was thoughtless and undeserved.  Please... go.~
@4922 = ~I have seen the Crying God heal many... and demand nothing in return.  He is a glorious and benevolent god, indeed.~
@4923 = ~Ilmater helps those in need... all of us in the slums could use his aid, I think.~
@4924 = ~Praise Oghma, the beneficent master of knowledge, invention and inspiration.  Come, seeker, and be welcome within his temple.  What can I provide for you?~
@4925 = ~Oghma teaches that knowledge must be collected and disseminated, and wisdom applied to its use.  The Wise God teaches that ideas must never be stifled.~
@4926 = ~This is not illithium! You have cheated my art!  Illithium holds no oil or grime! A handprint on illithium is an impossibility!~ [SARLES08]
@4927 = ~We seek to spread knowledge and to curb falsehood and rumor... especially with regards to history.~
@4928 = ~The things that are studied in the Oghmanyte orders are far beyond most people's comprehension.  We shall teach them... in time.~
@4929 = ~The most important element of illithium is that it will bear no dirt or grime! Cast as illithium, my work need never show the taint of another mortal's hands!~
@4930 = ~Then it should have been nothing! I have made my wishes clear, and you have made a mockery of them!~
@4931 = ~I can hardly ever sleep well... I have bad dreams in the night.  But sometimes Ilmater comes to me and comforts me and I sleep real good.~
@4932 = ~I was assured it had the same attributes as your metal.~
@4933 = ~Gosh, <SIRMAAM>... could you... afford a little gold piece?  I am so hungry and it's hours until we eat...~
@4934 = ~... I... yes, <SIRMAAM>... I'm s-sorry...~
@4935 = ~My mommy died giving me birth, and my daddy died in the war.  They left me all alone... an' I was sent here.~
@4936 = ~... I... I'm sorry... I just want my mommy...~
@4937 = ~I don't see why. This new piece is a welcome understatement. Looks as though it represents the shadows receding from the dawn. Fine work.~
@4938 = ~Nowhere. This place is unfriendly to even the pathetic dwarves of hill and mountain. Alright, fool, you wish to share my problem, I'll give it to you.~
@4939 = ~Nothing. Very few opportunities for mercantile trade in this place when you are even a hill or mountain dwarf. Alright, fool, you wish to share my problem, I'll give it to you.~
@4940 = ~You want illithium, you can wait for it. We mine it deep in the earth, and it's dangerous going. It's rare enough when production is normal.~
@4941 = ~You want to go chasing after him, that's your business. It's lost to me anyway. I show my face and he'll have the guards on me just for being duergar.~
@4942 = ~Ah Hah!~ [MAZZY36]
@4943 = ~Ach... missed!~ [MAZZY37]
@4944 = ~Spider Spawn (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 4
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

Upon casting this spell the wizard conjures several spider eggs into existence, quickly producing one or two fully grown spiders that remain under the wizard's telepathic control.  The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.
7th : giant spider
9th : phase spider
12th+ : sword spider
When the spell is cast there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one.  These spider(s) will remain under the wizard's control until slain, or the spell duration expires.~
@4945 = ~Summon Nishruu (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 6
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

By casting the Summon Nishruu spell the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, the Nishruu.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination this boiling churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.  Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Nishruu feed on the energies surrounding and used by wizards.  Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The Nishruu have no physical attacks at all.  However, they can be hurt by physical attacks.  Each time a Nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around him there are two major effects.  First all magical items with charges that the target possesses will be drained by one charge, destroying them if only one remains.  The second is that it causes the wizard to lose one memorized spell.  This is chosen at random, however, it will consume the highest level possible.  Excluding Death Spell, Death Fog or Dispel Magic, the Nishruu is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature.  The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.~
@4946 = ~Summon Hakeashar (Conjuration/Summoning) 
Level: 7
Range: 40 yards 
Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

This spell is similar to the 6th level wizard spell, Summon Nishruu.  The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons.
By casting the Summon Hakeashar spell the wizard calls into being a magical being of considerable power, the Hakeashar.  At first glance this appears to be some sort of mist but upon closer examination this boiling churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own.

Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.  The Hakeashar has no physical attacks at all.

@4947 = ~Young fools want a god to walk with them, but that is not the way.  It demeans a god to walk with the flock, just as if I supped with insects.~
@4948 = ~It is a beholder cult! The 'worshippers' are probably magically enslaved.~
@4949 = ~May The Destroyer guide your hand in the battle to come.~
@4950 = ~Serving Talos and living through the experience was reward enough.~
@4951 = ~Insanity! You... you tempt the fates like a mad<MANWOMAN>! Perhaps you will serve with your mindlessness, but you will never be of the chosen.~
@4952 = ~Talos would have welcomed you to the ranks of his chosen, but you have turned away. Madness.~
@4953 = ~But nothing is ever easy. Aside from his enormous commission fee, he claims he will work in nothing short of pure illithium - a metal more valued than gold!!~
@4954 = ~You will have to secure enough illithium to keep him happy, and convince him to accept an affordable commission. Discuss this with Sarles, he may be reasonable.~
@4955 = ~The Unsleeping Eyes of Helm have much to keep them busy now!  We have received word that Sarles will work for us! I cannot thank you enough.~
@4956 = ~But mere gold is not worthy of your service. You are of the chosen of Helm. You deserve greater tools with which to spread the word of Helm.~
@4957 = ~There is more to be done. An artist visits Athkatla now. Only Prism of Nashkel was more accomplished, but his work was sickly sweet and his death deserved.~
@4958 = ~Convince him to work for Talos. Use whatever means you must. Other churches are trying the same... if you cross their representatives, kill them.~
@4959 = ~You are as much use as Talos sees fit! Do you refuse this task?~
@4960 = ~Find his damnable illithium and make him accept a reasonable commission. He may rethink his demands if you press our point in discussion with him.~
@4961 = ~What is the disturbance, Talon? Talos alone reserves fury in his own temple. Ahh, is this to be the new tribute you have commissioned?~
@4962 = ~Well, he'll kill us both if I tell him now. You are very lucky, though perhaps Talos did guide you through this mire.~
@4963 = ~Aye, burn the elf!  Her dark and fiendish kin rose up from their underground homes and killed my father and brother!  They are all evil, I tell you!  All of them!~ [VICG201]
@4964 = ~As ye will. (Can't read, eh? 'Tis a fine pickle the Amnish school system's get itself into.)~
@4965 = ~What are you doing?!  Why have ye interfered with the judgement of Beshaba?! Her will must be shown to the people!~ [VICG107]
@4966 = ~And lo, the judgment of Beshaba has been called upon this most evil of drow, and she has been found wanting! May the people see their salvation from your evil in the Maid of Misrule! Pray that she is merciful, foul one!~ [VICG106]
@4967 = ~Huzzah!  Huzzah!!~ [VICTO302]
@4968 = ~I owe you my life, abbil... you have saved me once again.  I did nothing to provoke their attack, I tell you!  I was passing through the city when the man guessed my identity under my hood.~ [VICONIB3]
@4969 = ~I was surprised and he called out to others, revealing me.  I suppose they assumed I was here to spy on them... fools!  They are so quick to fear, these rivvin!~
@4970 = ~But, come... we must be on our way soon if we are to avoid drawing another crowd.  I distrust these barbaric people too much to hang about.~
@4971 = ~I have a duty for you to perform. It has been requested of us that we assist the temple of Lathander in their dispute with the worshippers of Talos.~ [TELWYN07]
@4972 = ~I found the stinking drow in the market, hiding under her cloak and hood, sneaking amongst us surely for an evil purpose!  She'll pay, all right... just like all of her kind will one day pay!~
@4973 = ~I do as Talos wills!~
@4974 = ~This drow is just like all the rest, I reckon... if we don't burn her now, she'll murder any one of us soon enough!~
@4975 = ~She was up to no good, she was!  Sneakin' around the markets, hidin' from us in her cloaks!  A spy... or an assassin!  Burn, I says!!~
@4976 = ~This is only right and fair... all the drow elves are evil to the core and this one is surely no exception!  This will show them that we can't be pushed around!~
@4977 = ~Oh my... I wonder if this drow means we are to be invaded by an army of them, soon!  Black elves bursting from the ground!  Oooohh...~
@4978 = ~The High Mornmaster of the Lathander has sent word you are to be congratulated. You have done well by helping the balance of power here.~
@4979 = ~Very well... I think I'll enjoy this.~
@4980 = ~We found her in the market... attempting to hide her identity!  No doubt a spy... we have taken the law into our own hands and it is good!~
@4981 = ~Stand aside and watch... or join us, if you wish, my <LADYLORD>!  Either way, justice will be done!~
@4982 = ~We know the culprits, they have not concealed their crime. Talassans, slinking from their temple to degrade our worship, hired common thieves for the deed!~
@4983 = ~<CHARNAME>... you... you abandon me?!  I have done nothing to warrant this!  Og'elend!  Traitor!  Iblith!  Oloth plynn dos!!~
@4984 = ~Do you demand more of your lord? Will you not march into danger for your faith?~
@4985 = ~We shall see.~
@4986 = ~I was merely concerned about the proper tribute to Helm for this task.~
@4987 = ~So much to do, so much to do... and so very little time.  It's never anything around here but run run run!~
@4988 = ~Mmm... I haven't been to one of the spa tubs in ages.  It's the only luxury we, here, in the city really have.~
@4989 = ~There was the oddest little gnome around here selling things like weapons and the like.  ... I could have sworn I remember seeing him selling turnips last month.~
@4990 = ~Ah... you wouldn't be here to sweep the street, would you, sir?~
@4991 = ~I am dressed as I am... and somewhat dirty... because of the time I have spent in the woodlands, sir.  I am NOT a street-sweeper.~
@4992 = ~Umm... weren't you dragged in here, earlier?  I could have sworn they were going to burn you.~
@4993 = ~Yes, that was I, rivvil... no thanks to your strange breed of law enforcement that you have in this city.~
@4994 = ~Don't ye go near the docks... I warn ye, it's dangerous and nearly unguarded.  Fie on the guard, fie!~
@4995 = ~Why, Lord Keldorn... pleased to meet you, sir.  I just came from droppin' off Leona at yer estate, I did.~
@4996 = ~Well, if it isn't Jan Jansen.  You incorrigible old gnome, you!  Married a lass yet, hmm?~
@4997 = ~I am not that old, madam.  And I assure you... should I decide upon a bride, you will be the first to know.~
@4998 = ~I am looking for some workers to add onto my manse... might you be interested?~
@4999 = ~I understand that the Jysstevs are hosting a famous artist... I do hope he will put on a display for us!~
@5000 = ~Let me see... you are the de'Arnise girl, aren't you?  Why aren't you decently married yet?~
@5001 = ~If you weren't aware otherwise, this is certainly the part of town to see and be seen in.  Hm... but, then, you're a commoner.~
@5002 = ~(yawn)  Oh, I apologize... were you actually speaking to me?~
@5003 = ~The Morninglord does not require your talents at this time. He will call if need be.~ [SAINXX08]
@5004 = ~I am telling you, my brother... the correct way to approach life is to accept its travails.  One must bend as the willow and see the obstacles that the gods place in front of you as challenges to be overcome.~ [PHIX0101]
@5005 = ~You continue to be a fine resource for the Morninglord. Your service has been exemplary, and you have earned your place within the temple order.~
@5006 = ~Don't be moronic.  You must struggle!  Through struggle we grow stronger!  Only the strong survive!  And I am not your brother.~ [PKIX0201]
@5007 = ~Strength comes through wisdom and pliancy... one must be flexible to accept the things that come.  Struggle only brings futility, my son.~
@5008 = ~Struggle and adversity bring strength, not futility!  War and violence weed out the weak and unhealthy, strengthening all!  And I am not your son.~
@5009 = ~Well, now I suppose you were right, after all.  Dead right.  Hah ha!  But I get the last word.  Come, Huntley... let's go.~
@5010 = ~Er... what the most magnificent Lord Pehllus means is that he is... far too busy... er... surveying the city to speak with you at the moment...~
@5011 = ~Um... what the most gracious Lord Pehllus means to say is... er... that he is waiting to meet a most lovely woman by the name of Oriona, and you are obviously not she.~
@5012 = ~Err... the Lord simply means to introduce himself, I am sure.  Bow before Pehllus Tanislove, one of the most powerful nobles of Athkatla and priest to the goddess of joy, Lliira.~
@5013 = ~Hmmmn... now, I am quite sure that I don't --~
@5014 = ~Uh... the Lord Pehllus means to say that he is currently not aware of your name...~
@5015 = ~Yes, of course, your Worshipfulness... my apologies, your Grace...~
@5016 = ~Er... ah... here's a platinum piece, good man.  Go play your instrument... somewhere...~
@5017 = ~Perhaps people just need a swift kick in the punctuals!~
@5018 = ~No, I seldom have time for reading. Too much work to be done!~
@5019 = ~Then they are dead! Dead!~
@5020 = ~Who?  Me?  I'm... I'm nobody.  I'm just a toady.~
@5021 = ~Um... I have nothing to do with raising the taxes, all right?~
@5022 = ~A crowd actually hauled a drow in here earlier... I... I think they're going to burn her!  Why won't anyone do something?!~
@5023 = ~Hmmn... that's three trade bars... and fifty dantars... how much is that in gold...?  Hmmn...~
@5024 = ~Hmmm... have you paid your taxes?  I wonder if you're on my list.  I must have you somewhere...~
@5025 = ~I only collect the home taxes... harbor taxes are collected at the docks.  If you want to pay for your trade booth, do it at the main office.~
@5026 = ~Wait one minute... you!  You're Jan Jansen, aren't you?  Four years behind on your home tax?  Selling without a license?~
@5027 = ~Young lady... why are you giving me such a queer look?~
@5028 = ~We have hired a thief, and he has stolen a Dawn Ring from the Lathander temple.  Find Travin in the Slums at night, collect the ring, and return it here.~
@5029 = ~Now I could let you in on some delicious secrets of some of the most powerful men in Athkatla... but that would be telling, wouldn't it?~
@5030 = ~When you've got it, you've got to use it to your advantage... you know what I mean, yes?  My two mansions and three cottages tell me I'm right.~
@5031 = ~Mmmm, darling, with lovely, dark skin like that... you could earn more than a living here, let me tell you.~
@5032 = ~Why, Lord Keldorn!  You've jumped into a river to avoid me, before, and here you are!  Have you... changed your mind?  (chuckle)~
@5033 = ~Er... ah... my lady!  I... I am a married man!~
@5034 = ~That is quite enough of that!  I... ah... I have urgent business elsewhere.  Excuse me, my lady.~
@5035 = ~I merely meant that I give great value to my service to Talos.~
@5036 = ~I've just been enumerating the tax landholds in the colonies... and a ship just arrived from Maztica telling me that three villages have been burned to the ground by the natives!  All that work, gone!~
@5037 = ~Er... you look like one of those men from Rashemen... you're not here to ask for anything are you?  Last time that happened, things got messy...~
@5038 = ~I'm sorry, sir... we don't allow dwarves in these buildings.~
@5039 = ~Hmmn... we seem to be all out of the vellum forms for tax concessions.  I guess the city goes without them this year... oh, well.~
@5040 = ~I've got a form for claiming land in Maztica around here somewhere... you have full rights to kill the natives, too...~
@5041 = ~The Dahaunarch is in the city... but I am afraid he is out on Council business right now and isn't expected back soon.~
@5042 = ~The Namarch is in Athkatla... but he is entertaining a dignified guest at his home and isn't conducting business.~
@5043 = ~The Meisarch... the highest of the Council... is currently at Riatavin dealing with the rebellion, according to my knowledge.~
@5044 = ~The Council of Six rules all of Amn, yes, but also the city of Athkatla... but they aren't currently sitting.  The bureaucracy is overseeing things here at the moment.~
@5045 = ~... Oh, ah, Lord Corthala... I'm afraid that the Council simply isn't willing to hear from you again regarding --~
@5046 = ~... Mm, ah, yes... the daughter of Lord de'Arnise.  The Council is taking the matter of your father under advisement.  We can let you know in, say, three to four weeks?~
@5047 = ~We will deal with the Sythillisian forces and the rebels down near Riatavin, not to worry.  Nothing will ever threaten the City of Coin, itself.~
@5048 = ~Don't get out of line, citizen... especially here.~
@5049 = ~All I want to do is find out why my little farm was taxed as a castle!  It's outrageous!  They have it listed as a castle, and that's it for them... they refuse to believe otherwise!~
@5050 = ~I even had a herald come and actually see my farm.  He decided it would be too much work to change the mistake that has my farm listed as a castle... so he said that he saw a castle there and left!~
@5051 = ~My family is one of the wealthiest in Athkatla... we have interests in the gold mines up north and the shipwrights here in the city.  So I will thank you not to stand too close..~
@5052 = ~I don't suppose you're from one of the mercantile companies, are you?  No... I didn't think so.~
@5053 = ~Hmm... hmmn.  Yes, you'll do.  You... the pretty elf, there.  I need a new mistress, and I think you'll do nicely.~
@5054 = ~Not... not in a million years, you foul beast!  <CHARNAME>... let's get away from him, please...~
@5055 = ~Hmph.  You there... any reason in particular that you're here?~
@5056 = ~Retrieve the document in any manner that you wish.  I would suggest using guile (but such subtle means are beyond these monkeys, I am sure.)~
@5057 = ~This cloak is an evil thing, albeit powerful. Made from the poorly stitched together skin of innocent nymphs, this cloak grants the wearer immunity to fear and panic.

@5067 = ~I'm sorry, but the prison is closed during the evening... no outside admittance is allowed.  If you wish to visit a prisoner, return in the morn.~

@5079 = ~It is a most dramatic play put on by the fine members of the Sigil troupe.  'Tis better to see than to be described... would ye like the ticket, then, mayhap?~
@5080 = ~Certainly... here is your 5 gold.~
@5081 = ~Alright... here is your 5 gold pieces.~
@5082 = ~Thank you, <SIRMAAM>... go on inside.  Hope you enjoy the play.~
@5083 = ~Thank you, <SIRMAAM>... go on inside.~
@5084 = ~No, Kirinaldo, I cannot!  Oh, Rodrigo... Rodrigo!  My fair love, where hast thou gone?!~ [FFACT201]
@5085 = ~Your lover has abandoned thee, sweet Lunisia.  You have only one option left... turnest thou to me and let us be wed at last!~ [FFACT101]

@5088 = ~Ah... yes, Rodrigo!  Rodrigo, it is thee at long last!  But where have --~ [FFACT202]
@5089 = ~I've been... uh... across the sea, my fair... um... my fair one.  Y-yes, that's it. Across the sea and, uh...~ [FFBIFF02]
@5090 = ~(ahem)... And perhaps on the new lands, my lord?~ [FFACT203]
@5091 = ~Yes, that's it!  On the new lands.  Yes... um...~ [FFBIFF03]
@5092 = ~Ugh! Where's the actor that was here last time?!  Pfaugh!!~ [FFCR0201]
@5093 = ~(AHEM!)  But... is it Rodrigo?  No!  No!!  How can this be?!~ [FFACT102]

@5102 = ~I... I am sorry, good folk of the audience.  As you can see, things are not quite right with our troupe due to circumstances beyond our control.~ [RAELIS07]
@5103 = ~I beg of you, good people, come back another day when we have restored matters... we shall prove to you then that the Sigil Troupe is worthy of your attention and coin, and we shall do so for free, of course.~ [RAELIS08]
@5104 = ~And, one final... odd... request, good folk.  If you, or another... knows of those who are skilled in the arts of sword and adventure... do send them to speak to me.  It is a matter of utmost urgency.~ [RAELIS09]
@5105 = ~If you have business with us, my <LADYLORD>, I suggest you speak to Raelis.  She is the leader of our troupe and our mentor... and she can tell you of our difficulty.~
@5106 = ~You are most gracious, my <LADYLORD>, to offer your assistance.  We thank you, truly... and I am sure Haer'Dalis will appreciate your help, as well!~
@5107 = ~The current step may be your first and may also become your last. The other two are abstract; this one is yours to choose and shape, though duty may force the choosing.~
@5108 = ~Hello.~
@5109 = ~I'm sure it would make you feel important, but I've simply no interest in you. I think you'll find we care about very little at all.~
@5110 = ~Oooh, yes, very threatening. I suppose you are expecting the appropriate response. All right then. Oh my, please spare us. Your descent into our city makes us oh so fearful.~
@5111 = ~Ah, you wish the exposition. Typical. I should really write this down so I don't have to keep repeating it. Not that we have had a lot of visitors.~
@5112 = ~We are the guardians. We guard the temple. This is very important because every few hundred years someone almost wanders this way.~
@5113 = ~Ah, hello...  I am afraid if you are looking for a refund for tonight's performance, I can only tell you to come back when our troupe is not in such disarray.~ [RAELIS02]
@5114 = ~This invisible ring cannot be removed from its owner.~
@5115 = ~Who are you people?  I don't quite... recognize what race you belong to, if you'll pardon my asking.~
@5116 = ~I understand what you ask, child.  We are people from distant lands and all of us are of mixed heritage.  Please, my good <MANWOMAN>... will you aid us?~
@5117 = ~His name is Mekrath, I believe... I know that his lair can be accessed through the city's sewers, though where exactly it lies is a mystery.~
@5118 = ~I am... unsure of your particular customs, but it has never been this Sigil's fortune to be treated fairly by the many city authorities that we have come across.~
@5119 = ~As well, though Haer'Dalis might be released, would the gem be returned?  The wizard could say it is his... and we could offer no proof to the contrary.~
@5120 = ~No... we must have our brother and his gem both safely returned, with no questions asked of us due to our strangeness.  This is the best way.~
@5121 = ~Very well... I shall do as you ask.~
@5122 = ~Sorry... not interested.~
@5123 = ~Fly, then... fetch our brother away from his captor however you might, and return to us soon.  My prayers go with you, my good <MANWOMAN>.~
@5124 = ~Forget it... I've decided not to continue this task.~
@5125 = ~Excellent, child... the fortunes of our troupe fly with you.~
@5126 = ~All the members of the Council are kept secret... that way, nobody knows who to bribe, you see.~
@5127 = ~The rebellion in the south is caused by demi-humans, that's what I think.  Never mind ogres and such... it's the elves and the like that are behind it all!~
@5128 = ~Amn should send more ships and people to the New World... our colonies there should supercede all the others and bring great glory to our nation!~
@5129 = ~Have you never wondered who is on the Council of Six?  I think it's all wizards, that's what... the wizards rule us secretly!~
@5130 = ~I sometimes think there is no Council of Six... and that the Cowled Wizards and the Shadow Thieves rule all of Amn in secret!~
@5131 = ~Believe me, rivvil... if the drow were here to rule, you would be well aware of it by now.~
@5132 = ~You Amnish are too closed-minded about the demi-human kin that live amongst you in peace... they are not so different from you as you seem to think.~
@5133 = ~When I am finally in the army, I wonder if I will sail to Maztica and join the colonial forces there... what a wonder it would be!~
@5134 = ~I wonder if the army would send me down south to fight that ogre fellow and his false 'Sythillisian Empire'?  We would show those creatures what a real war is!~
@5135 = ~Hmph.  I have been in the army, friend... and it is much more dreary than you think.  The victories, too, are few and far between... and hardly worth the price you are forced to pay.~
@5136 = ~You there, elven lass... you have the bearing of one of the lovely courtesans I have seen in this wealthy district.  Might I be correct in that observation?~
@5137 = ~The deal which placed us here has been followed to the letter, and we are never to be released from service no matter how pointless the task.~
@5138 = ~You will fail. You cannot help but fail. We know this. We expect nothing other.~
@5139 = ~Hmm... I have seen you entertaining somewhere, have I not?  Might you be for hire, sir?  I have a rather important function that I am hosting a week from now.~
@5140 = ~Business has been poor this year... I may have to go without that lovely lacquered new carriage I had my eye on.  (sigh)~
@5141 = ~Well... will you look at that?  A little halfling all dolled up in armor and such.  Why, aren't you just the cutest thing?~
@5142 = ~Wait one moment... I had my change-purse here but a scant moment ago?  Where could it have gone?  How shall I ever do my afternoon shopping?~
@5143 = ~We cannot petition the unknown. We have not seen a sign for ages and his name is lost to us now. No, nothing is directed at the temple except loathing.~
@5144 = ~(hurrrm... hurrrmmm)  Very well.  You look like one who might... appreciate... such entertainments.  There is more to my little place than meets the eye.~
@5145 = ~Then you have all the mind you need. We have long accepted our fate. There is no end to the duty. Rail against whatever beast is there, but it will do you no good.~
@5146 = ~I do not know and I do not care. You can do nothing here. There is no end to the duty. Rail against whatever beast is there, but it will do you no good.~
@5147 = ~What manner of creature was in there? It actually wanted me to attack it.~
@5148 = ~Was your god always as warlike as the beast in there?~
@5149 = ~<CHARNAME> walks here, and I have disposed of your little guardian.~
@5150 = ~You cannot have Boo, little girl!  But you may pet him and make pretty cooing noises if you wish.~
@5151 = ~Yes, certainly... here you go.~
@5152 = ~Then it is little wonder I cannot defeat the beast. It is their loathing and pathos, and it has become their object of worship, whether they know it or not.~
@5153 = ~Of course, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... we cannot all afford to help.  I shall leave you alone, then.~
@5154 = ~I... I apologize most profusely, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... I meant no offense!  I am simply in dire straits.  I... shall leave you be.~
@5155 = ~I weep for my children. Their hate sustains this place, though they would intend otherwise. Had they not thought of me at all I would have perished, and soon after so would they.~ [RIFTG07]
@5156 = ~I... am sorry, sir... truly I am.  But all the people with spare coin are here... and...~
@5157 = ~Ah, we be quite ahead on this project, aye?  63 days in and we can almost be beginnin'!  But we can't continue, now... poor Jerro has gone and busted his foot...~
@5158 = ~63 days and countin'... we'll be here by next year, I swear!  I would get started on me work, o' course, but I've had a bit o' a head rush.  Must sit down for a mite.~
@5159 = ~... Oh.  I see.  Well, it seems I was mistaken, then.  My apologies.~
@5160 = ~63 days into the project... we should be done diggin' the first section by, oh, say, 100 days or so.  I would keep workin' now, but me tummy is rumblin' somethin' fierce!~
@5161 = ~'Tis a fine job working for the government.  The overseer doesn't bother us... sleeps and drinks, mostly.~
@5162 = ~We're a team... a team, that's what we are... and as long as we stick together, nobody can make us work!~
@5163 = ~If you have a problem, talk to the overseer.  No, I don't know where he went... probably sleepin' somewhere.~
@5164 = ~The cause is simple. You will take the great device, the piece that I possess, and you shall combine it with the piece the creature already has.~ [RIFTG09]
@5165 = ~Tell my people that you carry the piece that I give you that you might deplete it; that you go to restore its components so that it may be disposed of as a whole, not in part. My people must know I intend to destroy it when you return... but more, they must know I intend to end their service.~ [RIFTG11]
@5166 = ~Er... yes, I am, actually.~
@5167 = ~The energies of my followers are directed at this place, not at me. Should I try to leave, I would likely lose my form, only to return in the temple some years later.~

@5169 = ~I know Keldorn... if it's all the same to you, I shall wait for him here.~
@5170 = ~Is that so?  Well, I do not recognize you and I find it highly unlikely that the Lady Maria knows of you.  Please leave the estate at once, <SIRMAAM>... I'll not have strangers poking about.~
@5171 = ~(sigh)  Lord Keldorn is a knight of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, <SIRMAAM>.  As I do not recognize you, I shall assume you are a stranger.  Please leave at once!~
@5172 = ~The destruction of a beast that is using you. I know not if you know its nature, but you will stand little chance against the thing without the great device.~
@5173 = ~Have you enjoyed your visit? Of course you found nothing and of course you will leave empty handed. There is... you...~
@5174 = ~Some idiot thief has stolen my necklace! Talos curse you for there shall be no services offered this day!~
@5175 = ~Oh, my... this business between Master Keldorn and Lady Maria is just terrible!  You may come in, my <LADYLORD>, but I would ask that you not disturb the Lady.~
@5176 = ~You have the great device! What are you doing with that? It cannot be moved! It has not been moved in a millennium!~
@5177 = ~It is the will of your god that it be taken from this place and weakened!~
@5178 = ~I do not believe you. Nothing has changed here in ages. If you have the great device it is only because our god is weaker than we imagined.~
@5179 = ~A sad, sad state of affairs, my <LADYLORD>.  Lady Maria is imprisoned and the children are understandably upset... I beg that you do not disturb them.~
@5180 = ~I was not going to try. You simply show how weak our god truly is. It changes nothing. We will remain trapped here, whether we've something to guard or not. Go, and be done with you.~
@5181 = ~I am sorry, my <LADYLORD>.  The master of this house is dead... I shall have to ask you to leave.~
@5182 = ~Who are you?!  What are you doing prowling about my home?!~
@5183 = ~(sob!)  You are... the companion of my husband?  (sob!)  Away with you!  Away!  You do nothing but take him further from my side!  Oh, I am doomed!~
@5184 = ~This cannot be. You cannot be the herald of change. It is not possible. I... I must see for myself. I must hear the word. We all must.~
@5185 = ~I intend to work things out with your mother, child.  Please... wait but a short while.~
@5186 = ~(sob!)  Go away!  (sob!)  I don't want to talk to anybody... especially daddy!~
@5187 = ~Who are you?!  Oh, my... thieves!  THIEVES!!~
@5188 = ~I wish we could have just been left with Lord William!  He was a better father, at least!  Just... just leave me alone!~
@5189 = ~What we placed was earned! We were abandoned to our endless duty while our lord slept! Our faith weakened and we... and we abandoned him, except in curses.~
@5190 = ~I remember this place... creatures among two apprentices, as I recall.  I can assure you they are all dead, now.~
@5191 = ~Is that so?  Well, then... you have done us a favor already.  You may go inside... but I warn you to keep to the first floor, my friend.~
@5192 = ~I hear. You who have suffered, who still suffer. The time is at an end. Letter of the law states that we guard until the end of time. Our time has ended.~ [RIFTG14]
@5193 = ~Praise be to the keeper of time, that he should let it end for the just.~
@5194 = ~This is the end of things. Rest your mind in my heart. Rest.~ [RIFTG15]
@5195 = ~Why do you speak in riddles, girl?~
@5196 = ~You will see. I cannot see, but that's because it's mine. You will see. Cannot fight it.~
@5197 = ~I am nine years in this life. They say my soul is the oldest of us. I am tired. Go see what we made. It's pretty. I wish I could see it. Can't fight it.~
@5198 = ~What is this?  Intruders within Mekrath's domain?  What brings you here, foolish <MANWOMAN>... speak quickly, for I do not suffer errant fools gladly!~
@5199 = ~Do not threaten me, wizard... I go where I like.~
@5200 = ~Sorry to intrude... I shall be on my way, then.~
@5201 = ~You'll release him to me... and his gem... or you'll meet your end at my hands!~
@5202 = ~Ha ha... spoken boldly, <MANWOMAN>.  I may have a use for one such as you, if you truly seek adventure.  Might you be interested in such an... escapade?~
@5203 = ~I might be... what sort of task do you speak of?~
@5204 = ~Adventure comes with its rewards... name what you offer and I'll consider it.~
@5205 = ~Perhaps he is at that, it matters little to me.  He stole into my sanctum as a thief... I captured him and it amuses me to keep him as my slave.~
@5206 = ~Regardless, you'll turn him... and his gem... over to me at once!~
@5207 = ~My price, hm?  Well... I do have a minor matter that needs to be taken care of.  Perform the task and I shall hand the foolish thief over to you.  Agreeable?~
@5208 = ~His gem?  Ah... THAT gem.  I see what game you are up to, little <MANWOMAN>, and it shall not work!  I'll not be divested of my gem by thieves and fools!!~
@5209 = ~Ah, this is the one!  Tch... the moronic beast has cracked it!  Pfah!  It shall take weeks to repair.  I certainly hope you killed the imp for this indignity!~
@5210 = ~He escaped ... and took a rather important device I was experimenting on.  A mirror.  Unusable if you do not know the proper incantations.  I would like it back.~
@5211 = ~The imp has likely escaped to the sewers... and your travel there would save me the time and aggravation of retrieving it.~
@5212 = ~A word of caution... the imp may have picked up an incantation or two and may have... used... the mirror.  One can only guess what it might have summoned up.~
@5213 = ~I remember the imp... and I have the mirror with me, here.~
@5214 = ~Very well... I shall seek out this item and return.~
@5215 = ~Forget it... hand over the actor and his gem now, or suffer your end at my hands!~
@5216 = ~But... you must be rewarded, as we agreed.  There is a slave... a thief I caught recently... that should be more than adequate.~
@5217 = ~Good.  I am going to find some materials to fix this blasted mirror.  I trust we shall not be seeing each other again... I shall not be disturbed a second time.~
@5218 = ~Well... what is it?  You have the mirror, I assume?!~
@5219 = ~No, I don't... and I do not intend on getting it, either.~
@5220 = ~You again?!  I tire of these constant interruptions!!  What is it NOW, foolish <MANWOMAN>... and your answer had better be a good one!!~
@5221 = ~You have a captive... I wish him turned over to me right now!~
@5222 = ~Do not threaten me, wizard... I go where I like!~
@5223 = ~You will die, wizard... good enough an answer?!~
@5224 = ~Very well... I shall leave you to your irritable solace, then.~
@5225 = ~What is this disease that you are afflicted with?~
@5226 = ~Ahhh... my head spins with sullen fire and strange, lurid notions instead of memories.  But... what is this?~ [HAERDA02]
@5227 = ~... My... my head clears, filled with stars and liquid fire... and I see before me the new holders of my shackles?  The wizard has released me, I see, only to pass my reins to another.~ [HAERDA01]
@5228 = ~And what if I want to lounge about your home? Who will stop me?~
@5229 = ~My well-paid guards of course. No doubt it would reflect very bad upon you to conflict with sanctioned city militia. I may be a simple collector of tomes, but I know the value of security.~
@5230 = ~Welcome to the home of Acton Balthis, currently Vice-Regent for the Council of Athkatla, my <LADYLORD>.  Er... Lord Balthis is not here, might I ask your purpose?~
@5231 = ~I am here to help myself to your lord's belongings... kindly step aside.~
@5232 = ~I was just looking around... I'll be on my way.~
@5233 = ~What if I were to try and retrieve it myself?~
@5234 = ~I don't much care who brings it to me.  I will pay you as much as the other fellows. Just don't damage the thing. It's entitled 'The Book of Kaza.' Off with you.  A word of advice however:  you'll need help from one of the other fellows, only they know where the book is.~
@5235 = ~You said that Lord Balthis was Vice-Regent for the Council... but I thought members of the Council were secret?~
@5236 = ~Korgan? I thought you were dead. Ahh, perhaps Shagbag and those others were getting ahead of themselves.~
@5237 = ~I ain't above putting a load of me fist in a few faces though, and sure enough they will get it. I'll off then, and catch them before they deliver the paperbound.~
@5238 = ~Either way, I will win. Good luck then.~
@5239 = ~Luck ain't no mattermind. Let's away to the garden of the dead. Methinks there be the best bet for the reader. I've a swift kick in the codpiece fer each of the gong-farmers ahead of us as well.~
@5240 = ~I serve Shar above all others, but I shall remain with you... for now.~ [VICONI35]
@5241 = ~I am not worried.  I am sure these... setbacks are only temporary.~ [YOSHIM04]
@5242 = ~Nothing is mattering all that much. I's just lamenting the turn of the coin that has taken me bookgold. I bet me lost partyboys have long gone with the loot by and by.~
@5243 = ~A... little help, here...~ [YOSHIM15]
@5244 = ~Ah, yes... the city.  With all its people and their accumulated wealth, yes?~ [YOSHIM17]
@5245 = ~What do they say... about daylight and thieves?  Oil and water?~ [YOSHIM19]
@5246 = ~Sou desu ne?~ [YOSHIM26]
@5247 = ~No, no, I dinnae think such a thing will happen. You'll be a day's dead before you get a coin for yout threat. I ain't one to bargain.~
@5248 = ~Then set your fury on the ground and we'll see if it stands up. I doubt it muchly.~
@5249 = ~Chief Inspector Brega, at your service.  I work under the Magistrate investigating the crimes of this city, and there are plenty that require my attention, believe you me.~ [BREGAX07]
@5250 = ~I am told that magic is illegal in Athkatla... is this true?~
@5251 = ~I must apologize, but I can carry no more. I have set your item upon the ground.~ [YOSHIM39]
@5252 = ~A momentary lapse, perhaps, but I fear this course will upset the greater picture. We must strive to maintain balance within ourselves.~ [CERND05]
@5253 = ~I will lead with gentle certainty, as the river shapes the rocks it flows through.~ [CERND08]
@5254 = ~Very little.  Lieutenant Aegisfield is in the Bridge District as the main investigator.  All I can say is to watch yourself at night if you must be out.~
@5255 = ~The handling of magic users is not my province.  Only the Cowled Wizards know for sure... what matters to the Council is that they deal with it.~
@5256 = ~The Cowled Wizards arrested two magic users.  Shadow Thieves were also involved, apparently attacking one of the wizards.  Beyond that... no, I know very little.~
@5257 = ~Nature acts in the simplest way.~ [CERND34]
@5258 = ~A bird in hand gathers no moss... or some such.~ [CERND36]
@5259 = ~I have taken something, though everything belongs to nature.~ [CERND41]
@5260 = ~(sigh)  I'll tell you what my job isn't... it isn't being forced to listen to idiots like yourself.  Good day.~
@5261 = ~Ahhh, good business to you, my <LADYLORD>!  My name is Quataris... might you be interested in some artwork?  A painting to add style to your abode?~
@5262 = ~I am sorry, friend... I see there is nothing here to interest you.  If you ever run across any... spare... works of art, I am always happy to buy.  Otherwise, good business to you.~
@5263 = ~I'm busy, okay? I'm busy!~ [EDWIN24]
@5264 = ~One day... one day...~ [EDWIN29]
@5265 = ~Watch your step... there are a lot of valuables, here, and they are protected well.~
@5266 = ~Gotcha good!~ [IMOEN42]
@5267 = ~The magic fizzled.~ [IMOEN48]
@5268 = ~You want a fight? I'll show you a fight!~ [IMOEN16]
@5269 = ~Hear ye, hear ye! All the news that's fit to bellow!  Today's latest: diplomatic overtures in Riatavin! Council of Six foresees resolution to southern troubles!~
@5270 = ~Riatavin? What's going on there?~
@5271 = ~Listen up, all. Riatavin and Trailstone petitioned to join Tethyr a few tendays ago, but talks collapsed under covenants gone bad. Now Riatavin wants back in.~
@5272 = ~The real tales behind the proclamations!  Each morning I've scuttlebutt on the fat and dirt on the pure. The call of the cock and I roll from my rock!~
@5273 = ~Allo! Allo! More Tethyrian exiles landing in Athkatla! Hear ye! Hear ye! Expelled for familial misdeeds! Oh shudder to think of all the red ink!~
@5274 = ~Umar was a witch who terrorized Amn a long time ago.  My mother says the hills were named after her, but she disappeared so long ago nobody remembers what happened.~
@5275 = ~Exiles? What's this all about then?~
@5276 = ~The Year of the Tankard has been a tough one for the rich and pampered trying to grind out a living on the backs of the poor down south.~
@5277 = ~Every morning I'm here, keeping the faith, protecting the righteous, and crucifying the guilty! Drop by to gnaw the fat and feast on the foolish!~
@5278 = ~Splint Mail is a variant of banded mail in which the metal strips are applied vertically to the backing of chain, leather, or cloth rather than horizontally as in banded mail.  Since the human body does not swivel in mid-torso as much as it flexes back to front, splint mail is more restrictive in battle.  This suit of armor is enchanted, granting the wearer a bonus of +1 to their armor class.

@5281 = ~I... I am glad that Quayle yet lives.  And... and I have found you, <CHARNAME>.  Perhaps the gods have begun to forgive my foolish pride.~
@5282 = ~Yes, it was.  I disregarded my teachings and I have paid for it.  I was taken from my home forever and bereft of my wings... a great and final punishment upon me.~
@5283 = ~I... I have paid for it, <CHARNAME>.  But saving that child was all I could do!  I hope he lives, yet... and I cannot believe that you would be so cruel as to cast that in my face!~
@5284 = ~He's dead, Aerie... and nothing's going to change that.~
@5285 = ~Please no more tears, Aerie... I am quickly growing tired of this.~
@5286 = ~Quayle befriended me when I was caged.  H-he would... bring me things.  To eat... or to make me more comfortable.  And he would teach me, sometimes.~
@5287 = ~He hated the owner for keeping me caged.  And... and when they had to cut off my wings, he took me in.  He taught me all he knew, and gave me my faith in Baervan Wildwanderer.~
@5288 = ~I was happy... of a sort... while I was with him.  I owe him so much.~
@5289 = ~I don't mean it that way, <CHARNAME>.  I... I am here because I must be... because I have to find my own way.  I... simply miss Quayle, still.  I don't know... is that not right?~
@5290 = ~I... I know that, <CHARNAME>.  His loss is a chill dagger in my heart.  If I speak of him, it is because he was one of the rare things since my capture that had given me happiness.~
@5291 = ~Quayle... he was one of the rare things that gave me happiness since my enslavement.  If this is so disturbing to you then I shall not speak of it... or... or to you, for that matter.~
@5292 = ~Oh.  I'd hoped that you might be someone important so that I could travel with you.  You are nobody, so goodbye.~
@5293 = ~Baervan is called the Masked Leaf... he is the gnomish god of nature.  I... I know it is strange for an elf to pay him homage, but that is the way it is.~
@5294 = ~I was always entranced by Quayle's tales of Baervan's escapades with his raccoon companion, Chiktikka Fastpaws.  They were filled with humor and kindness, and indicative of Baervan's gentle nature.~
@5295 = ~Baervan brought me my faith back... he gave me peace when I needed it most.  And I shall always pay him homage in my heart.  Is that so strange, <CHARNAME>?~
@5296 = ~I don't need a kid following me around.~
@5297 = ~Ha, you are probably correct.  I am a flightless elf lost in a strange land and am plenty strange, myself.  What I would not give, sometimes, to forget what I have known.~
@5298 = ~Is it so bad that it should threaten you?  But, then, I am mightily odd myself.  A stranger, alone and cast off from all I have known.  If only... if only you could understand.~
@5299 = ~Helmsport is the apple of New Amn's eye. Enter Waterdeep, seeking to expand her influence and ruthlessly plunder under the guise of diplomacy.~
@5300 = ~Have you traveled much?  I have been over much of Amn and Tethyr with the circus... although it was not always the most pleasant way to voyage.~ [AERIE94]
@5301 = ~Oh great, I'll just run and grab my things!  Mother, did you hear...~
@5302 = ~Don't whine to me about the circus, Aerie... my travels have not been by choice, either, and likely less pleasant than yours.~
@5303 = ~The Council of Six send an armada of Helm-priests and sellswords to expel the Waterdhavian traders before the natives sniff the winds of change!~
@5304 = ~I have not been that far north... the circus mainly made its way around Amn and further south.  I've been to Eshpurta and Murann, among other places... but people are all the same.~
@5305 = ~They gawked at me when I was caged... pointed and were cruel.  Once I was out of my cage, the people were no kinder... if it were not for Quayle, I could not have stood it.~
@5306 = ~I... I think I am glad, finally, to be traveling away from the staring and jeering crowds.  I am away from prying eyes, voyaging freely... on the ground, at least.~
@5307 = ~And... and I am glad to be traveling with you, <CHARNAME>.  You have saved my life and... made me feel very welcome.~
@5308 = ~Don't flatter yourself... you're here because you're useful and that's it.~
@5309 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>.  It... it was only an errant wish for talk and nothing more.~
@5310 = ~I... I am not whining, <CHARNAME>!  I know that you have not had an easy time, but neither have I!  Must you... must you be so cruel?~
@5311 = ~Always!  But be a dear, be sincere and get your ass on outta here. Let's foreclose on this topic. It can change, change fast and change she will!~
@5312 = ~You... you are making me blush, <CHARNAME>.  Th-thank you.~
@5313 = ~I... I see.  Th-then I shall endeavour to remain useful for you, <CHARNAME>.  To travel with you, if nothing else.~
@5314 = ~I see... I see I was mistaken.  If my presence makes it so unbearable for you, <CHARNAME>, then perhaps I should leave...~
@5315 = ~No... I apologize, Aerie.  I meant nothing by it.~
@5316 = ~Waterdhavians run amok in New Amn while the peace is policed!  Seems the New World has all the Old World problems!~
@5317 = ~Every morning my soapbox is set, my mouth full of moxie and my head swims with tales from across Faerun! All true! All timely! All told with aplomb and vigor!~
@5318 = ~Then... then I shall stay with you.  For now.~
@5319 = ~Hear ye! Hear ye! The Rebellion she truly begins today! Today of all days! Riatavin and Trailstone have defected! 
~
@5320 = ~It... it is nothing, truly, Haer'Dalis.  I am simply... thinking of a time when I still had my wings.  Sometimes... sometimes the memory still wrenches my soul.~ [AERIE74]
@5321 = ~I'm Rebecca.  You're my idol, <CHARNAME>.  I have been following your exploits for months.~
@5322 = ~Do you?  I... mean no offense, Haer'Dalis, but I find that hard to believe, if you have never flown.~
@5323 = ~"My fall was not the thing, my love,
 I thought I bore it well
 but to stare up into the heavens
 from the darkened plains of hell
 and think that I, too, once walked those
 endless heights
 is a pain I cannot tell."~
@5324 = ~Damage control for the Council now comes in the form of arbitrators sent to Darromar to restrict the involvement of the Tethyrian government.~
@5325 = ~With the dawn and a yawn comes new tales and old friends.   I'm all over it, like the stench on dung! Check here each morning for the latest on the latest!~
@5326 = ~That's... that was very lovely, Haer'Dalis.~
@5327 = ~They are but simple words, my dove.  For this bard to understand but a tiny fraction of your pain has cleft my heart in twain.  You... have my deepest sympathy, sweet, lonely Aerie.~
@5328 = ~I... th-thank you.~
@5329 = ~Oh... but you will surely laugh at me for such an admission.~ [AERIE75]
@5330 = ~You flatter me, now, Haer'Dalis.  But... yes, my mother used to tell me that I would be a fine actress.  I... I used to dream of fluttering onto the great stage in Faenya-Dale...~
@5331 = ~You are funny and strange, Haer'Dalis... but I thank you for the compliments, nevertheless.~
@5332 = ~Oh?  Have you, Haer'Dalis?  And to what manner of role shall I be subjected, then?~ [AERIE76]
@5333 = ~You wound me, fair one... I have deliberated over the choice for quite some time, now.  I have weighed carefully each play that canters through my head and chosen one that compliments you most fruitfully.~
@5334 = ~'Tis the lead of a Sigil play called 'Tersis'... written, if I remember, by a rather haggard tiefling gifted with the madness of true talent.~
@5335 = ~You would play the goddess, herself... fallen from favor and bearing the slings of accusation and scorn with grace and confidence.  With chin held high, she strides towards her former peers and dares to challenge the false verdict of the higher powers!~
@5336 = ~That... that sounds lovely, Haer'Dalis... but it's hardly me.~
@5337 = ~Ah, but it is, my mourning dove.  You have suffered the cleansing torments, borne under the impossible strains... and I'll wager there's a steel in your heart that you've yet to lay claim to!~
@5338 = ~Oh, I don't think I ever could... I don't think you know me, really...~
@5339 = ~I know you better than you think, my dove.  The true thespian reaches down into a well of dark waters within them... a place where others dare not look.  And you've a deep well, fair Aerie... be not afraid to dive within!~
@5340 = ~You've a pretty way with words, bard.  Well... I think I'll disappoint you surely, but if you wish to teach me your play I won't object to it.~
@5341 = ~That's all I ask, my dove... and this bard cannot wait to see the results of this first act now unfolding...~
@5342 = ~What is it, Aerie?  By the gods... you're drenched with sweat!  What's wrong?!~
@5343 = ~I... (gasp)  ... I was having a dream.  A most dreadful nightmare!!  Please... please sit with me for but a short while... I am shaken to my very core...~
@5344 = ~(shudder)  I... I was back in the circus, after my owner had decided that my wings had become too diseased.  I had been laying in my cage, sweating and delirious for days...~
@5345 = ~... his men came and pulled me out, and my wings burned so!  I could barely cry out, I was so weak!  And... and they began to saw off my wings... hacking at them with rusted knives!~
@5346 = ~(shudder)  I screamed and screamed!  They... hacked off... my wings and then used... torches to seal my wounds.  Oh, <CHARNAME>...!  (sob!)  Oh, <CHARNAME>, I... I...!~
@5347 = ~I... (sob!)  ... I didn't mean to bother you.  Please forgive me... it won't happen again...~
@5348 = ~It's alright, Aerie... that was a long time ago.  Calm yourself...~
@5349 = ~Shhh... calm yourself.  I understand.~
@5350 = ~It... it felt like I was there again!  I can... I can still feel my wings being torn from my back...~
@5351 = ~I... I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>.  It was so long ago, I should not still be so torn.  I... I must resign myself to my fate.  Come... let us continue on with your journey...~
@5352 = ~I have been thinking... I shall never fly again, never taste the freedom of my wings, I am sure of it.  I... I don't know if I can face this wretched existence on the ground...!~ [AERIE96]
@5353 = ~Don't say that... we'll find some way to restore your wings, I promise!~
@5354 = ~If you continue to act so weak and maudlin, then I agree... you'll never survive.~
@5355 = ~We'll find a way to restore your wings, Aerie... I promise you that.~
@5356 = ~Find the strength?!  Find the strength?!  How can you be so cruel as to cast that at me?!  I... I am a member of a proud race... my wings were everything to me!~
@5357 = ~I can never go back to Faenya-Dale!  I could not face them without my wings!  Here I am, stuck like an insect crawling on the dirt...~
@5358 = ~And you tell me to simply be strong?!  W-well... what am I supposed to be strong for?!!  I... I hate this existence...~
@5359 = ~I can never go back to Faenya-Dale, never look another of my kind in the eyes again!  I could not face them without my wings!~
@5360 = ~Y-your promises are empty!  I... I h-hate myself and this l-life! Just... just stay away from me!~
@5361 = ~How... how could you be so cruel?  (sob!)  I... I h-hate this life... I hate m-myself... and I hate you!  Just... just stay away from me...!  Just stay away!~
@5362 = ~I... I am sorry for the way I yelled at you.  I sometimes feel... as if I have been weighted down by many stones... but I should not have reacted so to your words.~ [AERIE97]
@5363 = ~It's alright, Aerie... but you are going to have to accept your fate and find a way to deal with it.~
@5364 = ~Forget it... if you can't deal with your problems, I'm not about to let you drag me into them.~
@5365 = ~I... I suppose you are correct.  But how can I?  Tell me how I can ever accept this, <CHARNAME>?~
@5366 = ~You've got to find another reason to live, Aerie... something else to hold onto.~
@5367 = ~Don't look to me for the answers... I don't have them.~
@5368 = ~I will try to carry on with you, <CHARNAME>.  I just... I just don't know if I can.  But I will try.~
@5369 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>.  I will try... to deal with it as best I can.  I just don't know if I am strong enough.  Please forgive me...~
@5370 = ~Be strong?  I... I'll try, <CHARNAME>.  I just... I just don't know if I can, but I will try.~
@5371 = ~I just wish I knew what that was.  It was once so easy... why have the gods punished me so?  I shall try, <CHARNAME>... I will try to be strong.  I just... don't know if I can.~
@5372 = ~Yes... I know.  I must find the answer on my own.  Nothing... nothing could make me sadder, I think.~
@5373 = ~Why must we always be fighting?  All I see is bloodshed and battle... and it drains me.  Do you... do you not yearn for a life of peace and contemplation?~ [AERIE98]
@5374 = ~Sometimes battle is required, Aerie... it is not something that I have a choice about.~
@5375 = ~Struggle and combat bring strength, Aerie... and I have needed all my strength just to survive!~
@5376 = ~And yet it continues on and on.  I... I don't know how much more of this I can take.  I feel so empty inside...~
@5377 = ~Fighting has brought me strength, Aerie... the strength to survive.  You could use the same.~
@5378 = ~You have a choice, Aerie... you can always go back to the circus, if you wish.~
@5379 = ~Strength... always you talk of strength and being stronger.  I... I do not know if I have your strength, <CHARNAME>.  I am beginning to think it is almost not worth it...~
@5380 = ~(sigh)  I will, <CHARNAME>.  I will stay so quiet that you shall not even hear me... nor notice when I am finally gone, I suppose, and more's the better when that happens.~
@5381 = ~I... do not wish to go back to the circus, <CHARNAME>.  There is nothing for me there.  I just... I just wish I had your strength... that it was easier to forget what I once was.~
@5382 = ~Noses are akimbo about Maztican gold falling into chubby fingers while Riatavin and Trailstone are left reading from the wrong books and the dogleg ledgers!~
@5383 = ~Their petitions have been renegotiated and the Council is flabbergasted with this latest episode! A curse and a wail in protest as Amn is rent asunder!~
@5384 = ~Prick up your ears and hear this woeful tale of loss. Half a tenday ago, the Council was talking with Riatavin about welcoming them back into the family fold.~
@5385 = ~This turn of events could draw Athkatla into a trade war! A war, alas friends, no one can win! Oh for grief if it's embargoes and sanctions!~
@5386 = ~Awaken ye to the song of the sea!  The story was delivered by pearl! The council abandons hope on getting back Riatavin and Trailstone! Hear all about it!~
@5387 = ~What happened there, Neckeith?~
@5388 = ~It's a blight on Amnian commerce! The Merchants' Chosen of Riatavin took the money, split the difference, and bit the hand that fed them all in one fell swoop!~
@5389 = ~Now Riatavin is still bitter over its red ink in the Maztica deal. Riatavin's merchants are denying Amnian access to trade routes in their territory!~
@5390 = ~Does anyone really give any sort of damn about this Riatavin nonsense?~
@5391 = ~Some drunken sailor just walked by with your mam on one arm and a tankard of bathtub gin on the other. Now go away, kobold! You bother me.~
@5392 = ~In retaliation for treating the Duchess of the Purple Marches like a common kobold, Queen Zaranda accepts petitions from the two renegade outposts!~
@5393 = ~The comely Queen Zaranda of Tethyr is outraged at the Council of Six, treating her Lady Haredown so shabbily, and by rote, her country!~
@5394 = ~Riatavin now lays claim to land south of the Tejarn Hills! The Council lurches all trade to a deafening halt! Our Six are dragons, and wily ones at that!~
@5395 = ~I... I need you to tell me what the worth of a life on the ground is.  Is there anything to compare to the freedom of living in the clouds?~ [AERIE99]
@5396 = ~Good business, gathered friends! I've got dirt that might hurt and you'll scarcely believe the cloak-and-dagger conspiracies! Two old adversaries resurface.~
@5397 = ~There's no point in your musings, Aerie... this is the way things are and there's no avoiding them.~
@5398 = ~No... they can't be.  Everything of beauty can be seen from the sky.  And there are so many places you cannot go if all you can do is walk.~
@5399 = ~Yes... I'll have to get used to it.  An unpleasant prospect, when a life looms over you without joy or freedom.  I... I don't know if I can, <CHARNAME>.~
@5400 = ~I don't mean to bother you, <CHARNAME>.  I am used to remaining in cages, neglected.  I'll... just keep my thoughts to myself from now on.~
@5401 = ~Are there better parts, <CHARNAME>?  How would I recognize them if I discovered them?  I... I just don't know if I can wait for them to come along.~
@5402 = ~Just... just ignore me, <CHARNAME>.  I must seem very pitiful and wretched to moan so all the time.  You must despise me.~
@5403 = ~Search for them?  I'm not sure I would even recognize them.  Nor do I think I can go on much longer... I just can't... stand it any more.~
@5404 = ~A coward.  Y-you're likely right, but it's still cruel to say so.  How you must despise my weakness and moaning.  I... I'll not bother you any longer, <CHARNAME>...~
@5405 = ~W-we're stopping?  (sob!)  Oh... I... I just feel like collapsing here and dying.  I just don't think I can go on.~ [AERIEA1]
@5406 = ~Perhaps it is better and more fitting if I just... just die.  Like a bird whose wings are broken, I am useless, <CHARNAME>... utterly useless.  *sob!*~
@5407 = ~I've... I've had enough of this life!  (sob!)  P-perhaps it would be better if I... just went back to the circus...~
@5408 = ~Y-you are so heartless!  I... I will go!  Forgive me, Baervan, but I can do this no longer!!~
@5409 = ~Y-yes... forgive me, <CHARNAME>... I tried, I really did.  I... I'm just not strong enough.  G-good-bye...~
@5410 = ~But I have, <CHARNAME>, I have!  I... I just don't have the strength!  I'm so useless...~
@5411 = ~(sob!)  I... I can't!~
@5412 = ~N-no... no, I don't want to die.  Maybe... maybe I will think on what you have said.  Let... let me just sleep... for now.~
@5413 = ~I have been thinking, and you are right.  I have been foolish.  I may not have my wings, but I have everything else, especially... my life, and people who care for me.~ [AERIEA2]
@5414 = ~I am such a silly woman.  Whining and crying... I must seem so ridiculous and petty.  No man will ever want me, I think... I feel so embarrassed.~
@5415 = ~Well... it's good to see that you're feeling better, at least.  Let's just continue our travels, shall we?~
@5416 = ~I'm glad you're better... but you're wrong, still.  There are many reasons a man would want you... not least of which is your beauty.~
@5417 = ~Certainly, <CHARNAME>.  And... thank you... f-for your encouragement to me.~
@5418 = ~O-oh... I didn't know you f-felt that way.  I... I will just stay out of your way, then... for now.~
@5419 = ~Oh... I see.  Well... thank you, <CHARNAME>.  Umm... do you... do you think I'm beautiful?  I mean... do you feel all these things about me?~
@5420 = ~Don't mistake me, Aerie... you are beautiful and everything, but I would prefer we maintain our friendship.  Let's just continue our voyage, shall we?~
@5421 = ~And I care for you, <CHARNAME>.  Th-thank you... for everything you have done... for me.  I feel... much better.~
@5422 = ~I've read the play, yes... but, Haer'Dalis, I still honestly don't think I can play this Tersis character.~ [AERIE77]
@5423 = ~Well... the scene where the goddess confronts Lord Jhovan, the ruler of the gods.  She chastises him rather... forcefully...~
@5424 = ~(giggle)  Oh, Haer'Dalis... I could never do that!  The words would sound like a mouse were speaking them, coming from me.  I've no such voice in me...~
@5425 = ~The voice is in you, my dove.  You have but to cast about for it.  Come... enact the passage for me.~
@5426 = ~(sigh)  I... I'll try.  "H-hold, my Lord... I will n-not... not be judged..."  No, no... it's just no use.~
@5427 = ~Haer'Dalis!  What a cruel thing to say!~
@5428 = ~Fine.   "H-hold, my Lord... I w-will... n-not... not be... --"~
@5429 = ~"H-hold, my Lord!  I will... n-not... not be... j-judged --"~
@5430 = ~"Hold, my Lord!  I will not be judged by the lowest of my brethren, nor shall I be judged by my King!  I refuse to be silent!  I am Tersis!  And I WILL be heard!"~
@5431 = ~I... I did it, didn't I?  Th-thank you, Haer'Dalis!  That... that felt wonderful!~
@5432 = ~Ha!  What is it now, my fair Aerie?  You think I am not looking at you, but I can spy your desire to put the bard to the question.  Go ahead, my dove... I'll not mind.~ [HAERDA71]
@5433 = ~Well... I was only wondering... um... my scenes that I read to you the other day.  Was I... was I any good?  Please tell me truthfully.~ [AERIE78]
@5434 = ~What of other news?~
@5435 = ~How's this? Your mother was a jackal and your father was an ass, which make you, urchin interruptus, a jackass! Now stop disrupting my train of thought!~
@5436 = ~You... you aren't just saying that?  I'm not that good...~
@5437 = ~Your skill needs to be sharpened, 'tis true, but the talent is plenty and full.  And I do not exaggerate, my dove... your mother saw it true when she mused o'er your life upon the stage.~
@5438 = ~A cauldron of cold intrigues! A witches brew of bad news! Cyricists of the Twin Towers of the Eternal Eclipse are wooing the ogre magi Sythsillis and Cyrvisnea.~
@5439 = ~Ha... it's too bad, then, that there's nowhere to perform our piece.~
@5440 = ~Blackwill Akhlmere, of the horse-breeding Akhlmere empire, requires aid! The Giant's Eye Trading Company has run into Cyricists at the Mountain of Skulls.~
@5441 = ~Word of our acts would spread... and we would be in demand all over Amn!  Bugbears would stand beside great nobles, shouting out your name and mine!  The toast of Kings and Queens, my dove... just imagine it!~
@5442 = ~Ha ha ha!  You are a silly man, Haer'Dalis!~
@5443 = ~Blackwill offers sellswords to the Sythillisian Empire for the attack on Murann. The Green Fields Consortium keeps a close eye on events!~
@5444 = ~Ear to the ground and eyes wide round, check with me every morning for the true book lowdown on the high-born and the skinny on the fat! Good business!~
@5445 = ~"Aye... Tersis has come to you, my Donner.  Your yearning has called to me across the void, and against all sober advice, I have come."~ [AERIE79]
@5446 = ~Good business! You could cook a hen's egg on your forehead this morn! Riatavin is in hot water this day! Caravans disrupted and contracts corrupted!~
@5447 = ~"Then let me sing your praises while I can, my Queen.  Let me tell you how I adore your flaxen hair, your porcelain skin... let me tell you how I long to brush my hand across your pale cheek..."~
@5448 = ~Er... Haer'Dalis...?~
@5449 = ~Haer'Dalis, your words... your words aren't in the play.~
@5450 = ~Forget the play, my mourning dove... I speak what is in my heart.  My words come unbidden to my lips, for you have captured my soul in your innocent hands.~
@5451 = ~I... I thank you for your words, Haer'Dalis... but...~
@5452 = ~E-enough... please.  I... I am flattered... but... but I was not expecting this.  Please... leave me alone but for a while...~
@5453 = ~Aerie... my sweet dove... I have given you time to ponder my words, but my aching soul yearns for requitement.  Do you not feel some measure of love for this solitary bard?  I beg you to say that you do!~ [HAERDA73]
@5454 = ~Haer'Dalis... this is all s-so... sudden...~ [AERIE80]
@5455 = ~It is not sudden, my love, but rather it is momentous... a revelation of affection that has stricken me like a most welcome affliction!~
@5456 = ~Tell me that you feel similarly, my mourning dove, and I'll be yours forever more, my heart lain at your tender feet.  Or tell me that you have no love and I'll be forsworn... but say it true!~
@5457 = ~I... I do not deny that I hold you in great esteem, Haer'Dalis.  You have been most kind.  It... it is just that...~
@5458 = ~I... I don't know.  I truly don't...~
@5459 = ~I... I know this may seem an... odd question.  But I need to know... how do you... f-feel about me?~
@5460 = ~I love you, Aerie... I thought you knew.~
@5461 = ~Feel?  You are a friend... no more and no less.~
@5462 = ~It... it cannot wait, <CHARNAME>.  Or, at least, my heart will not let it wait.~
@5463 = ~Alright... what is the question?~
@5464 = ~Ah... no... no, I did not know.  I suspected... and hoped... but I did not know.  Oh, <CHARNAME>, this is so terrible!~
@5465 = ~Oh, that sounds all wrong!  I... I do care for you very much, <CHARNAME>!  I do!  But I... I also care for Haer'Dalis!  This is... so confusing... I must think about this...~
@5466 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>... I... th-thank you for saying so!  My heart is fluttering so... oh, this is so terrible!~
@5467 = ~No, you will have no victory here! Rejiek must work on!~
@5468 = ~I... I see.  That answers my question most... f-fully.  Th-thank you, <CHARNAME>... I think of you as a... friend... as well.~
@5469 = ~I... I see.  F-forget about my question, then, <CHARNAME>.  It... it does not matter, really.~
@5470 = ~My raven!  If you would but hold and step aside, but for a moment... this hapless bard would make a private plea of you.~ [HAERDA74]
@5471 = ~What is it, Haer'Dalis?~
@5472 = ~Not now, Haer'Dalis.  This isn't a good time.~
@5473 = ~You are man worthy of my dove's affections... of this I am sure.  But this sparrow asks of you to turn away from her and to allow her affections to settle on myself!  My heart yearns for her and I beg this favor of you!~
@5474 = ~I cannot simply switch my feelings on and off at will, Haer'Dalis!~
@5475 = ~The choice is hers, Haer'Dalis.  Not mine nor yours.~
@5476 = ~(sigh)  Very well, Haer'Dalis.  You may have her for yourself, if that is your wish.  And if she'll have you.~
@5477 = ~But you must, <CHARNAME>, you must!  I cannot bear to watch my dove with another... and you are a man who could surely have another!  I beg of you not to twist my heart!~
@5478 = ~It is not even up to me, Haer'Dalis... it is up to Aerie whom she chooses.  I cannot give her to you.~
@5479 = ~The answer is no, Haer'Dalis!  And I meant it!~
@5480 = ~If she means that much to you, then very well... I will step aside.~
@5481 = ~But she is a fragile flower, my dark hound... she will wish to hurt neither of us with such a momentous choice!  And I cannot bear to be without her!~
@5482 = ~Please... step aside, <CHARNAME>, and let our true love be unfurled!~
@5483 = ~I love her too, Haer'Dalis.  I can't just give her to you.~
@5484 = ~Very well... if she means that much to you, I will not interfere.~
@5485 = ~The heavens sing with your praises, my hound!  You have made this poet's heart leap with joy!  I will not forget this, <CHARNAME>... you have made our union possible and I thank you with all of my soul!~
@5486 = ~I can imagine only one outcome to this black path you have placed us on.  We shall see which of us my dove chooses... and what agony results of it!~
@5487 = ~My mourning dove... the time has come for you to make a choice between us.  I beg of you to decide, as my ailing heart can wait no longer!~ [HAERDA75]
@5488 = ~I... oh, Haer'Dalis!  I never expected for any of this to happen!  I... I love both you and him in different ways... I cannot simply... choose between you!~ [AERIE82]
@5489 = ~Please... can't you understand that?  I beg of you not to press me!~
@5490 = ~I... I see, my dove.  There is only one option that remains, then.  <CHARNAME>... I challenge you to a duel... a fight to the death for the love of our lady Aerie.~
@5491 = ~Very well... a duel it is.~
@5492 = ~You want to duel for Aerie?  Haer'Dalis... if she means that much to you, then I will not interfere.~
@5493 = ~There is love... or there is death, my dark hound.  My honor demands no less.  Look within your heart and you will understand.~
@5494 = ~Aerie is right, Haer'Dalis.  We should not fight.  Put down your swords and let us talk.~
@5495 = ~Step aside, Aerie... the bard wants a duel and he'll have it.~
@5496 = ~<CHARNAME>?  Y-you would... you would simply give up on me?  Give up on your feelings for me?~
@5497 = ~Can't you see, my dove?  It is I who love you with zeal... it is my passion that yearns for you.  <CHARNAME> is a good man... but even he sees that my love is the love that is true.~
@5498 = ~I... I do love you, Haer'Dalis.  I am glad that you did not f-fight over me, but I must... I must have time to set my heart straight.  Please... g-give me time.~
@5499 = ~Of course, my dove... take all the time you need.  My heart shall still pound hotly for you a day or an eon hence.  And thank you, <CHARNAME>, for your understanding...~
@5500 = ~Aerie... my love... do not restrain me from combating my foe for your affection!  Our blades must meet, it is the only possible end!~
@5501 = ~No, Haer'Dalis!  It is NOT the only possible end!  I said I would not allow you to fight over me and I meant it!~
@5502 = ~I am not something for you to become impassioned over like a jewel or a poem, Haer'Dalis!  I do not think your love is real, if you would resort to violence to prove it!~
@5503 = ~I love <CHARNAME>.  I love him deeply and without hesitation... and I know he feels for me, as well.  And that... that is how it shall be.~
@5504 = ~I... see.  My... my heart aches to hear these words, my dove... but I sense they are true.  If I offended you... I apologize...~
@5505 = ~And I apologize to you, <CHARNAME>, if my heart was foolish and o'erquick.  I cannot deny what I feel, however... and I cannot stay and watch my dove stay with another.~
@5506 = ~Until... until we meet again, <CHARNAME>.  And... and farewell, my lady love...~
@5507 = ~If you would resort to violence to prove your love for me, than you are not the man I thought you were!  I... I love Haer'Dalis... I know that to be true, now.~
@5508 = ~Yes, my bard... I do love you.  <CHARNAME>... put down your arms and accept that... that this is the way it will be.  I... I am so sorry.~
@5509 = ~I... I can't bear to watch you with another, Aerie.~
@5510 = ~It... it breaks my heart that I must leave you... but leave you I must, then.~
@5511 = ~And I with you, my dove... wherever you go, I shall be with you.~
@5512 = ~I'm sorry that this couldn't have... worked out better.  Farewell, <CHARNAME>... I hope... I hope that we meet again, someday.~
@5513 = ~I... I suppose I was correct, then.  Your feelings do not run as deep as those of my bard's.  Come, then... I would be glad to fight by your side.  Let us continue your quest.~
@5514 = ~I have... something that I must ask of you... an awkward question, if you will.~ [AERIEA3]
@5515 = ~I have been thinking about you quite a bit as of late.  I know this may seem an... odd question.  But I need to know... how do you... f-feel about me?~
@5516 = ~Well, it will still have to wait, regardless... this is not the time.~
@5517 = ~And I love you, too, <CHARNAME>.  Ooh, this is a most wonderful relief.  You have been... so kind and helpful to me, I am glad of your love.~
@5518 = ~Come, then... let us continue on our travels and we can speak more of this later.~
@5519 = ~And I, too, care for you.  You have been... so kind and supportive.  I... I thank you, <CHARNAME>.  I feel awkward, but I am most pleased that you have requited my feelings.~
@5520 = ~As... as you wish, <CHARNAME>.  Forget my question, then... it was of no importance.~
@5521 = ~A... a friend?  Then it is... then it is good that I have asked this.  I am glad we are friends, <CHARNAME>... let us continue on your quest and I shall be glad to fight by your side.~
@5522 = ~Haer'Dalis?  Might I have a... a word with you?~ [AERIE87]
@5523 = ~I... I just wanted you to know... I've noticed the amount of time you've spent with me...~
@5524 = ~This sparrow shall not come betwixt the two of you.  Be merry, my swan... its glow suits you well.  And who knows?  Perhaps I shall play at your wedding!~
@5525 = ~What about Baldur's Gate? Heard anything from there?~
@5526 = ~Th-thank you... but I wanted you to know that I... that I have feelings.  For <CHARNAME>.  I... didn't want you to get the wrong idea...~
@5527 = ~Well, I'll not lie to you, my mourning dove... I had my eye set upon your gentle heart.  But 'tis always a grand thing when two friends join in love.~
@5528 = ~Ha ha!  Oh, you rascal!  It... it's nothing like that!  But... but thank you for your understanding...~
@5529 = ~I... I've been thinking about some of the things you've told me.  I... I wanted you to know that I've come to a decision.~ [AERIEA4]
@5530 = ~The first caravans from the East arrive in Riatavin, and the Merchant's Chosen buys up all the shipping contracts, cargo and goods! Everything!~
@5531 = ~Not right now, Aerie... this isn't the best time.~
@5532 = ~It'll be a cold day in the Nine Hells before I read from anything other than the clean book! Good business!~
@5533 = ~Hear ye one and all! The mercantile families of Amn demand the Council declare war over the most grievous crime of all -- disruption of trade!~
@5534 = ~Riatavin's purchase of caravan contracts has incurred the wrath of Amn's richest citizens. And upsetting the wealthy is none too wise!~
@5535 = ~Riatavin has also moved the fiscal center south, away from greedy fingers and watchful eyes! Oh the plot she thickens by the minute!~
@5536 = ~The sun rises today with fear in her eye!  The Council has moved on Riatavin!  Sellswords on the march by the hundreds!  Carnage! Murder!~
@5537 = ~Why is it always about Riatavin and trade gossip? I'd like to hear about something else for a change.~
@5538 = ~Two rich families -- the shipwrighting Argrims and the gold mining Lurraxols -- hired every sellsword in the kingdom to lay siege to Riatavin!~

@5540 = ~I am determined to... to face this life on the ground, <CHARNAME>.  My wings are gone and that can never be changed.  I must learn to appreciate the beauty that I can still see.~
@5541 = ~Hear ye! Dawn arrives with the sweet chime of profit! Good business! The Shadow Thieves have entered the Riatavin fray!~
@5542 = ~And I... I hope that you will be here to teach me about it, <CHARNAME>.  To show me how one can live on the ground and still... still be happy.~
@5543 = ~I am mourning the loss of my fellow adventurers... it was a long and hard week to drag their bloody bodies back to the city.~
@5544 = ~Stand away, fool... I am a warrior-born and I mourn my fallen.  I shall not be disturbed.~
@5545 = ~Again it's Riatavin, ten days in a row! How about other stories for once?~
@5546 = ~Leave me be... go find my ubiquitous halfling companion if you wish to chat merrily with someone.~
@5547 = ~Confusion must be your sole bedfellow, traveler.  If you had a brain you'd have it on the ground playing with it. Good business!~
@5548 = ~They were good friends... and mighty fighters.  I shall miss them.~
@5549 = ~There is a story about a clueless prat with a town crier's foot broken off in his arse. Step aside for those who'd hear the mouth that roars!~

@5551 = ~Seven sets of severed feet are found in Riatavin alleys, and martial law is imposed in the Gateway City!~
@5552 = ~Other criers deliver banality and belly laughs at the cost of truth, but yours truly only speaks from the right book!~
@5553 = ~I doubt it... we'll be lucky enough to stay alive with death waiting around every corner for us.~

@5557 = ~Yes, I know that our life has its risks... but I have a feeling that Baervan has had his hand in my path.  We shall see what the gods have planned for us, I suppose.~
@5558 = ~Our life is filled with uncertainty, that is true... but you could at least make the attempt, <CHARNAME>.  Well... we shall see, I suppose, what the gods have in store for us.~
@5559 = ~Yes, it was a great adventure... and a successful one, as well.  I defeated my half-brother and stopped a war.~

@5566 = ~Dawn breaks as does news of the Sythillisians! Fort Ishla falls under a humanoid onslaught! No one is spared! An unparalleled tragedy!~
@5567 = ~The Sythillisians? That doesn't sound good, crier.~
@5568 = ~Pull my finger and you're guaranteed something special -- I had a feast of Maztican spiced noonmeats last eve! Now move aside!~
@5569 = ~The Skullgnasher army of giants and the Spearbiter goblins laid waste to Fort Ishla!  The monsters have set their sights on slaughter!~
@5570 = ~Good... that makes me feel a little better.  It is strange to be thrilled and yet shivering at the same time... I am free, and I am traveling... and I feel like I am flying.~
@5571 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... I am glad of it, as well.  I... I am free... and traveling... and both excited and nervous at the same time.  I almost feel as if I am flying again.~
@5572 = ~The Small Teeth bred the filthy legions that took our outpost! No Amnian soldier escaped the massacre -- a thousand families fatherless!~

@5574 = ~Not now, Aerie... this isn't a good time to talk.~
@5575 = ~I have never been that far north... nor have I traveled anywhere outside of the circus.  I have been told about some of the other places in the world where one can go, however...~

@5577 = ~Calimshan is supposed to be a great place of sand and silks, merchants of all kinds... there are supposed to be strange and exotic dancers and great, spiralling towers.~
@5578 = ~The Moonshae Islands are supposed to have magnificent mountains and waterfalls... along with beaches of blue sand and ancient forests that time has barely touched.~
@5579 = ~And... and the jungles of Chult!  Towering trees and vines, exotic spices and flowers that smell of the sultry heat... rainstorms that last for days...~
@5580 = ~I... I want to go to these places, <CHARNAME>!  I want to voyage there and see their beauty for myself... I want to stand there and feel it... touch it with my hands.~
@5581 = ~That sounds wonderful, Aerie... I wouldn't mind joining you someday.~
@5582 = ~It's translated in the ancient tomes of yore as "Do us all a favor and shut the hell up."~
@5583 = ~Gambiton is trampled flat,  its people have all fled screaming! The King's Arch is destroyed and no one can escape to Esmeltaran!~
@5584 = ~I see.  Alright, <CHARNAME>... I'll be quiet, if that's what you want.~
@5585 = ~Heavy rains are pummeling the region out of season, thwarting Amnian efforts to reach the Hillfort Ishla and reckon the true caliber of damage!~
@5586 = ~I would like that, <CHARNAME>... although, of course we must pay attention to surviving, first.  Likely, we will face death many times... but it is pleasant to dream, isn't it?~
@5587 = ~Oh, I know.  I do not plan on running off to go to these places.  I know we face death, here, and will many times.  It is just... pleasant to dream, isn't it?~
@5588 = ~And who are you to say it will never happen?  I know I face death fighting by your side... and I am happy to do so... but I would like to dream of the future, as well.~
@5589 = ~The only people who are rejoicing in Athkatla are the followers of Talos, thrilled with the destruction wrought from nature's blind, storming fury!~
@5590 = ~I... I would have thought you capable of dreaming, <CHARNAME>.  Not everything must be hard steel and stern decisions.~
@5591 = ~Nothing, nothing at all. This wasn't meant for you then. Good day to you.~
@5592 = ~No, no, that wouldn't be it. Do stop wasting my time, will you?~
@5593 = ~What? Who are you? No matter. You'll be dealt with soon enough if you are crossing the Rune.~
@5594 = ~I've been wondering... do you have any advice for me for combat?~ [AERIEA7]
@5595 = ~Stay in the back and use your spells... that's the best help you can be.~
@5596 = ~I know how you feel about my being strong, <CHARNAME>... and I want to fight well by your side.  I... I don't want your foes, powerful as they are, to get the best of you.~
@5597 = ~Well then, I trust you have the blood and the unfinished armor? You do fine work, but it requires my special touch to finish it off.~
@5598 = ~I smell the scent of dragon blood, but I do not see the unfinished skin armor. Do not delay, bring both the blood and armor to me and I will make a suit of legend.~
@5599 = ~Fine work takes time. You must give me the full four days before your armor is done. Leave me.~
@5600 = ~I have completed the task, and your armor is done. Beautiful it is. Here, examine it in your own hands.~
@5601 = ~Hear ye! Esmeltaran falls to the Sythillisians! Esmeltaran falls! Defenders of the city are crushed to pulp by the unstoppable force!~
@5602 = ~I shall try to improve my skills with magic, over and above what my uncle Quayle was able to teach me.  I suppose... I suppose that is the best way I can aid you.~
@5603 = ~I know that you are determined to combat evil... and I wish to do so, as well.  I don't want to be a burden... I want to be effective.  I want to survive so that I can see the world.~
@5604 = ~I think that's what I have been doing... I know I'll never be that good with weapons as some of your other companions are.  If... if you need me to fight by your side, <CHARNAME>, I will do so... to the death, if need be.~
@5605 = ~Well, stop drinking turpentine and get yourself an honest profession. Step away so that the citizenry can gain proxy to the truth spoken from the right book!~
@5606 = ~None at all, <CHARNAME>?  I... I don't want to be a burden to your group.  I want to fight effectively by your side... and survive, so that I may travel the world with you.~
@5607 = ~I... I know that it might be difficult to foresee what is to happen in the future... but do you have any plans?  Once this is all over, I mean...~ [AERIEA8]
@5608 = ~The Skullgnashers and Spearbiters descended upon Esmeltaran.  In a matter of hours the city was overrun with giants and goblins! Picture that!~
@5609 = ~I don't know... I was thinking of settling down somewhere...~
@5610 = ~Well... do you see yourself traveling?  Or settling down?  Do you... do you see yourself with me?~
@5611 = ~I would prefer to be with you, Aerie... if the gods are willing.~
@5612 = ~You want to settle down?  Here in Amn, perhaps?  Do you... do you see me in that picture?~
@5613 = ~Of course I see you... if you see yourself, that is.~
@5614 = ~Nope... I don't see you there.  Sorry.~
@5615 = ~Yes... you have god's blood in you, I'm told.  When you... when you travel, do you see me traveling beside you?~
@5616 = ~I'd want you beside me... if you wanted to be there.~
@5617 = ~Good business! It's a hot one here, but not as hot as the standing air down south! The Amnish army reaches Hillfort Keshla!~
@5618 = ~Oh... don't you... don't you want to be with me?  In the... future, I mean?~
@5619 = ~Of course I do... if it's possible.~
@5620 = ~Over half of Keshla's contingent has been assimilated into the big, bad band of bastards!  Battle plans are drawn up, and Riatavin is ripe for an ass-kicking!~
@5621 = ~There's no point in talking about it, Aerie.  Nothing is sure in my life... and I have lost too many people to start forming new attachments.~
@5622 = ~That's... that's good.  I would like to be with you, if the gods will it.  Th-thank you, <CHARNAME>... I just... I just wanted to be sure that you felt the same for me.~
@5623 = ~Three days march separates our brave lads form liberating the agitators! Three days to certain doom for the firebrands with an axe to grind!~
@5624 = ~I do... but I also want to be with you.  I... think I want to be with you more.  You are more exciting and thrilling than any wonder of the land that I could encounter, I think.~
@5625 = ~But... that is... that is only if you want to be with me, too.  Do you?~
@5626 = ~Well, no... not really.~
@5627 = ~Heavens above she's a hot one this morn! Good business! Riders from the Amnian army reach Hillfort Torbold!~
@5628 = ~Ah.  So you end it with cruel finality.  I... I suppose I should have expected that from you.  I was... hoping for something more, <CHARNAME>.  I suppose I shall look elsewhere...~
@5629 = ~Continue, crier.~
@5630 = ~How ironic... that you would push me to be strong, and yet be too frightened to attach yourself to someone.  I... was hoping for more, I suppose I shall look elsewhere.~
@5631 = ~My love...?  I... I know that you are tired from the day's travels and that you wish to rest, but I... I wish to ask you something, before you retire to your blankets...~ [AERIEA9]
@5632 = ~A third of Torbold's troops head east to join forces marching on Riatavin!  Soon after they depart for Keshla, straggling wounded arrive from Esmeltaran!~
@5633 = ~Olehm now bolsters morale and readies his troops and fort for full scale war!~
@5634 = ~Here... come with me away from the eyes of the others.  We will not be very far from them.  I simply wish privacy.~
@5635 = ~Now that we are alone... let me speak for a moment.  You have led me to a tremendous discovery, <CHARNAME>... I have found that I do not need wings to fly.~
@5636 = ~I... do not have much experience with love, <CHARNAME>.  With your urging, I have become eager to experience many things... and now I wish to experience this.~
@5637 = ~I... I will show you my body, <CHARNAME>... and I hope it pleases you.  Would you... would you stay with me this night, <CHARNAME>?  Will you show me what true love consists of?~
@5638 = ~Er... I can't get past those huge lumps of scar tissue on your shoulders.  I'm really not in the mood.~
@5639 = ~Get lost, Aerie... I'm really not interested in being your tutor.~
@5640 = ~Very well... what is it that you wish?~
@5641 = ~Not now, Aerie... I'm too tired to discuss anything.~
@5642 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>... the time is right and I must speak to you of this.~
@5643 = ~I... I see my wishes have no bearing on your moods.  As... as you wish.  I will sleep by myself tonight and from here on.  Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@5644 = ~Poor roads can't deter the stalwart General Craumerdaun from marching to Esmeltaran!  The hardy contingent changes its course from Riatavin to the occupied city!~
@5645 = ~C-come close to me, then, <CHARNAME>.  Let me feel your hands on my skin... let us lay together so I may experience your love and become a woman at last...~
@5646 = ~I... don't know what love is, <CHARNAME>.  But... maybe it would be better to wait until all of this is over.  The thought of laying with a man frightens me a little, I must admit...~
@5647 = ~Stay with me for the night, then, <CHARNAME>, and hold me to you.  I... don't want to be alone, and I so desperately need to be near you...~
@5648 = ~Hear ye!  More news of the scurrilous Sythillisian's Empire! Horrors abound as the legions of evil march on Imnescar!~
@5649 = ~As you wish... that I am more than willing to do.~
@5650 = ~Forget it, Aerie... I'm not interested in someone who is so needy.~
@5651 = ~Let's whack something eeeeevvvvillllll...~ [SSWORD10]
@5652 = ~How about some other story?~
@5653 = ~So you send me away with... with your cruel words.  I... I thought I loved you... and yet you cut me open without hesitation.  I... should have known better, I suppose.~
@5654 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>... I shall go and sleep by myself and console myself that it is better that I never allowed one such as you to touch me.  I... shall not trouble you further.~
@5655 = ~So... you are awake at last?  I have been... watching you sleep for some time, now.  It calms me, watching you... and it gave me time to think.~ [AERIEB1]
@5656 = ~I've been... thinking about last night.  You were right, of course... it isn't the right time to experience love when we are always in danger of perishing.~
@5657 = ~I was so eager to experience everything new that I... did not think.  Thank you for respecting me.  I... I love you... and I want our first time together to be something special.~
@5658 = ~I love you, too, Aerie... and I agree.~
@5659 = ~Yes, well... let's just continue our travels, shall we?~
@5660 = ~Let us go, then and find this Irenicus.  Once this is over, I want to experience everything with you.  I... I never thought I would find something... better than flying.  Thank you.~
@5661 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.  Let's... finish your quest, and then we can see where we stand.  And where we can go from there, yes?~
@5662 = ~In... in case I die... or in case we part ways... I just wanted to tell you, <CHARNAME>, that I never thought I would find something better than flying.  But I have... and thank you.~
@5663 = ~I am?  I had thought you had cared for me.  But... perhaps you kept me away because... because you did not care enough for me.  I had not thought of that.~
@5664 = ~I am too quick to assume, <CHARNAME>... and I have much to learn.  I wish you would have been gentler with me, but you have taught me much, and I thank you.~
@5665 = ~Let us just... continue on your quest.  I shall trouble you no further... and will look to further my experience elsewhere.~
@5666 = ~So... you are awake at last?  I have been... watching you sleep for some time, now.  It calms me, watching you... and it gave me time to think.~
@5667 = ~You... have made a woman out of me, <CHARNAME>.  I love you more deeply than I can say and can only thank you for what you have done for me.~
@5668 = ~But... at the same time... I cannot help but think that things need to be slowed.  I am so full of emotion... I want to experience too much and am doing it all too quickly.~
@5669 = ~My heart clenches at the thought, but we must stop ourselves from going down this path.  I need to... to find out more about myself... before I can attach myself to another.  I... hope you understand.~
@5670 = ~I do... but maybe you need to find your own way, Aerie.~
@5671 = ~The Most Noble Odor of Radiant Farts are pathetic.~
@5672 = ~If... if that is what you think I should do... then perhaps I must.  I... I shall miss you, <CHARNAME>.  I shall always hold you dear in my heart.~
@5673 = ~I think you will find the amount adequate. 10,500 gold is no small fortune, though I think you deserve a little more. From my personal armory, a sword.~
@5674 = ~But, come... a new day awaits us, <CHARNAME>.  Let us... let us see what it holds.~
@5675 = ~One day we shall meet again, <CHARNAME>... and I... I hope that I will be ready to love you then.  F-farewell...~
@5676 = ~I... I am doing this because I must, <CHARNAME>.  My life has never been my own... I am frightened by the unfamiliar and I am unfamiliar with most everything.~
@5677 = ~I need to... find out more about myself, <CHARNAME>... I need to become familiar with and experience everything... but slowly.  And with you it will never be slow.~
@5678 = ~I... I do love you, <CHARNAME>, and I hope you understand.  If you would find it too hard... if you want me to go now... I will understand.~
@5679 = ~No... please stay, Aerie.~
@5680 = ~Aerie, this... this bard can wait no longer for your thoughts to settle upon his heart.  I... I must know now what you feel, my dove.~ [HAERDA76]
@5681 = ~We'll go now and retrieve this Cup for you, although it hardly seems a test of our abilities.~
@5682 = ~Oh, Haer'Dalis... I... I am not ready to...~ [AERIE83]
@5683 = ~What do you say? Care to have your name placed above a young guild of Shadow Thieves?~
@5684 = ~Without question. I will do my best to turn it into a prosperous guild.~
@5685 = ~Why... that's sweet, Haer'Dalis.  I'm... I'm honored.~
@5686 = ~But I will know it, sweet Aerie, if you but declare your love for me.  Allow me to salve your wounded heart, Aerie... allow me to caress your pale skin and show you that my love is true.~
@5687 = ~I... I do love you, Haer'Dalis.  You have swept me off my feet... and I can no longer deny it.~
@5688 = ~It is nothing, Haer'Dalis.  Just... just some errant thoughts.~ [AERIE84]
@5689 = ~Tell me anyway, my love.  Your poorest word is a sweet poem to this bard's ears... and I would not have you experience a moment of fluster, if there was aught I could do for it.~
@5690 = ~Well... I was just wondering, Haer'Dalis... where do you see us in the future?  You have spoken of plays and acting... have you been serious?~
@5691 = ~Ah... the future.  I see.~
@5692 = ~Your love has given me new hope, my bard... I want to see what life has to offer, no matter my lack of wings.  I... I want to travel, to see this world.  Will you... be there with me?~
@5693 = ~Time holds its own counsel, my love... and destiny plays such a game with this sparrow that even I cannot foresee the outcome.~
@5694 = ~Live in the moment?  I... I have always done that, Haer'Dalis.  I want to live for the future, now... don't you?~
@5695 = ~I could not, even if I cared to, my sweet dove.  Here... let me sing to you...~
@5696 = ~"When Man was made it was said
 he would have eyes in the front of his head.
 But the first Man was scared,
 as he saw before him, lay bared,
 the future... and in it, he was dead."~
@5697 = ~Hmm.  A limerick for every occasion, Haer'Dalis?~
@5698 = ~Ah, my dove... I see you have finished perusing my latest play.  Would you care to act out a scene or two?~ [HAERDA78]
@5699 = ~Actually, Haer'Dalis... I have a question.  All your plays... they seem to end in tragedy or destruction.  They are all so... so dark.  Have you no happy plays?~ [AERIE85]
@5700 = ~I would like to offer you the opportunity to help the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.  Are you interested in hearing my proposal?~ [KAYLXX07]
@5701 = ~That is a shame, truly, for we have no one else to turn to at this time.  If you change your mind, please come back and speak with me.~
@5702 = ~Ahh, my sweet Aerie.  I write my plays as befits the creed of the Doomguard.  All things end in destruction and tragedy... to think otherwise would be foolish.~
@5703 = ~Foolish?  You... you can't honestly think that.  Is there no room for hope in your world?~
@5704 = ~Even hope is eroded, my dove.  All things break down, over time... all things come to an end.  'Tis the natural order of the multiverse.  Who am I to question this?~
@5705 = ~But... but you can't embrace destruction... you have to fight against it, don't you?~
@5706 = ~On the contrary, one must assist the multiverse in attaining its goal.  One day, all things will cease to exist... this is the way it shall be.  The Doomguard stands to assist this goal.~
@5707 = ~But why would you... why would you even build a home or... or fall in love... if you thought that way?  If all things decay, why start anything?~
@5708 = ~A brief and...?  No... no!  Love should be enduring!  It embodies hope and strength... are you saying that you expect it to end?~
@5709 = ~Of course I do.  Ah, but I see I have upset you, my dove.  Let me reassure you that the multiverse shall not end in my lifetime... at least I do not expect it to.~
@5710 = ~And while I know that our love must end, I do not expect it to do so soon.  The Fates will decide, and until then I shall love you truly and with all the heart I can muster.~
@5711 = ~No... no, I... I just want to know that you'll love me... and that you'll be there for me... that is all.~
@5712 = ~I... I guess that'll have to be enough.  For now.~

@5714 = ~The Vampiricus Omnibus: Unabridged
Ending the Plague of Teeth

This tome is quite ancient, and you do not recognize the tongue in which it is written.  Fortunately, Bodhi has scrawled a translation of selected passages in the margins, as well as further questions she apparently wished to ask on the subject.

Stuat tuo Gotha: 
The resolution:
With the witch at the fore, long previous to her treachery, we did stride the hills of Umar seeking comfort in our hour of need.  The time had come for the living to mourn no more, and the blades that were fettered by sentiment were cut free, and it was decided that we would speak for our lives with the sinews of our sword arms.  The honored dead that did take flight in the darkness of shadow would no more receive sorrow from those of us that had lost their friends and relatives to the plague of teeth. 

Mornat de'pas Golvana Fathorn:
Battles when came the dead:
There came we, the army of light, armed with faith and conviction, and we did march unto the tombs of the restless dead during hours of day.  With wooden edge we struck down master and slave, though many paid for each thrust with their lives.  In the fallen there was the danger of a scourge anew, and many of the newly infected seemed doomed to walk again with dire purpose. 

Aegato Davon:
The plea:
"No more" cried we!  No more would we lose to the plague.  These new fallen could not be abandoned.  We had fought for our lives and theirs, and they would not be taken.  To the Temple we went, to the god of Sun and Light.  Amaunator would save them.  Amaunator, whose touch turns shadows to fire.  In the arms of the Sun god were the infected placed, and the hearts of their dark masters were laid there with them.  Blood did burn, and the dead returned, but not as undead or unliving, but alive and freed from taint.  Many did walk the light side home, when last the plague did fall.

Relevance of archaic worship of Amaunator?
Origin of vampiric plague?
Any link to a modern cure to be worried of?
Historical document or historical fiction?

A final note is scribbled...

@5743 = ~Now, now, people... come, this is no time to panic...~
@5744 = ~Please... listen to my husband!~
@5745 = ~(ahem)  Yes... well... we are looking for another group of adventurers, here, to handle the situation...~
@5746 = ~People, please!  We must first find out what happened to our ranger, Merella... and then track down the source of these murders.  More adventurers will come soon.~
@5747 = ~Aye!  Ye better be doin' something, mayor... or we need t' be fleein' our homes soon.~
@5748 = ~Ye best be doin' something, mayor... or we need t' be fleein' to the city for our safety!~
@5749 = ~Errrm... hello?  I don't recognize you... you must be new to Imnesvale.  Is there something I can help you with?~ [MINIST02]
@5750 = ~Actually, I spoke to a boy by the name of Delon in Athkatla... he said you were in need of assistance.~
@5751 = ~I saw your speech outside of the village... you in need of an adventurer?~

@5753 = ~Investigate the deaths in the Umar Hills.

The Mayor has thanked me for eliminating the ogre and his band, and has asked that I rest in the village... or at least return in seven hours or so, as he must travel to obtain my reward.~
@5754 = ~Oh, stranger... my little Imnesvale is in dire straits.  We are dying quickly, and yet we cannot leave.  You look like a hearty sort... will you aid us?~
@5755 = ~Ah, I see.  Well, do be careful, stranger... the killings have made Imnesvale a very inhospitable place, indeed.~
@5756 = ~Herrrm... yes, of course.  It's a gruesome business.  I'm sure that little Delon told you some of the story, but I should elaborate on it for your benefit.~
@5757 = ~I's been keeping up of <CHARNAME>'s friends, so's I knows you are okay. In you go, if you like.~
@5758 = ~We've had a run of... killings and disappearances here, as of late.  People murdered in their beds... their bodies disappearing... bodies found with the skins inside out.~ [MINIST06]
@5759 = ~I'll keep that in mind.~
@5760 = ~Anything you need? Anything at all, you just ask.~
@5761 = ~Sorry, but I can't afford to buy anything, and all my stock is being shipped to the main guild office. Can't fund a fence if the guild branch has collapsed.~
@5762 = ~Everyone's frightened... but they're scared to leave, as well, lest they get caught out in the wilderness by whatever has been doing the killing.~
@5763 = ~Welcome to the guild. I haven't heard much about you, but if Renal says you're alright, I'll take his word on it.~ [JARIEL02]
@5764 = ~It's the ogres, my husband... you know it is.~
@5765 = ~Errrrm... my wife, Eina.  And, yes... many people think it's that group of ogres who moved into the area just before the killings began.  Likely is, too.~
@5766 = ~And still others claim Umar, herself... the great witch of the hills... has returned.  Legend has it she was responsible for deaths much like these ones.~
@5767 = ~They're in the hills... too close to the village, I say!~
@5768 = ~Yes... true.  I suppose I should warn you... I've already hired the famous knight, Mazzy Fentan, and her troupe... but they haven't been back.~
@5769 = ~To be honest, I think you should check on the ogres and their fellows before chasing after legends and such.  So... will you... will you help us?~
@5770 = ~No... I don't think I'm interested.~
@5771 = ~Herrrm... well, my village is in dire need.  I'll tell you what... if you end the murders, I will give you the armor that belonged to our first ranger protector.~
@5772 = ~Let's not have an antagonistic relationship, <CHARNAME>. I am your lieutenant, and I will need to be able to trust you.~
@5773 = ~Well, you have a stable of several thieves here, which I will introduce to you. Each has a specialty, and each has more thieves under them.~
@5774 = ~Renal 'the Bloodscalp' runs the Shadow Thieves in the city... and he is the leader of numerous guildmasters that ply their dark trade throughout Athkatla.~
@5775 = ~Very well... I will make the attempt.~
@5776 = ~You cannot use a party required transition while someone is in a store.~
@5777 = ~But... but you have come all this way, my <LADYLORD>... are you sure you will not reconsider?~
@5778 = ~(sigh)  That is too bad, my <LADYLORD>.  Do be careful around these parts, then... I wouldn't want more victims claimed in these strange killings.~
@5779 = ~You can continue with all your thieves in prison, but you will get no profit. No use getting mad at me... if I die, the guild fails. I have Renal's ear, you see.~
@5780 = ~Now, would you like to discuss the patterns your thieves will assume this week? They are operating at a low level of risk right now, just covering the quota.~

@5817 = ~Errrm... ah!  It is Mazzy Fentan, our adventurer knight returned to us!  But... these other folk with you... I do not recognize them...~

@5827 = ~Not... not yet?  Then... why have you returned?  Is there aught amiss?~
@5828 = ~Oh... that is a relief.  Please... I beg of you!  Destroy this creature as soon as you can!~
@5829 = ~I... I am greatly disappointed.  If... if you change your mind, please do tell me, yes?  Imnesvale... we don't have much time, I think.~
@5830 = ~Yes, my <LADYLORD>?  Is there... is there something you need?~
@5831 = ~I believe the wolves... or wolf-like creatures... are responsible for your problem.~
@5832 = ~You mentioned being in need of adventurers when we last spoke... are you still?~
@5833 = ~That is most excellent news.  That group has frightened the village for too long... I have no doubt they are responsible for everything that has happened.~
@5834 = ~Thank you, my <LADYLORD>.  I... I must go and acquire your reward.  I will not be back for a few hours.  You could rest at the inn,  or come back later for it.~
@5835 = ~I would prefer to have it now... I don't like waiting.~
@5836 = ~I apologize for the delay.  I will be back in about seven hours or so with your reward... come and see me then, my <LADYLORD>.~
@5837 = ~I... I am afraid I do not have any reward here for you, my <LADYLORD>.  I do not keep such valuables where... where others can get at them...~
@5838 = ~Oh... well, I will be back in about seven hours or so with your reward.  Errrm... anytime after that will be fine, as it pleases you.~
@5839 = ~Wh-what?  But... but I was sure that those monsters were the killers!  What makes you so certain that they are not?~
@5840 = ~Madulf has had his own people going missing... much the same as yours.  He is as worried as you are.~
@5841 = ~Ohhh... that isn't good news at all.  If ogres can be worried, what should we be?~
@5842 = ~Actually, Madulf sent me with a proposition ... he and his people will provide protection for the village in exchange for peaceful relations and a bit of trade.~
@5843 = ~He... he has?  I... I must say... that might not be such a bad idea.  If this ogre can be... can be trusted, that is.~
@5844 = ~Thank you for bringing this to my attention, my <LADYLORD>.  I will have to... go and talk to them, I suppose. We could both benefit from this.~
@5845 = ~Since... since the ogres are no longer a possibility, all I can suggest is you go to Merella's cabin.  There must be some evidence of what happened to her!~
@5846 = ~If... if that is the case, my <LADYLORD>, then I beg you to go and destroy these wolves!  They cannot be allowed to continue their carnage!~
@5847 = ~I'm well prepared. Perhaps I can solve this mystery.~
@5848 = ~Please... you... you agreed to help my village and I ask that you not abandon us now!~
@5849 = ~Ah... er... there is a problem, my <LADYLORD>.  You... you said that you had killed the ogre and his band quite some time ago, yes?~
@5850 = ~Well... it seems that only a few hours ago, one of the more distant farm families in Imnesvale was attacked and... and killed.  It was just like all the others.~
@5851 = ~What... what terrible news!  The ogre and his band could not have been doing the killing, after all...~
@5852 = ~Greetings to you once again, <GABBER>!  Do not think that Imnesvale has forgotten the fact that you have saved us from doom... and possibly worse!~
@5853 = ~You should know that Madulf has agreed to protect the town... and the merchants are pleased to provide him with food and other sorts...~
@5854 = ~Very well... you are welcome to stay in Imnesvale as long as you like, however.~
@5855 = ~I'll tell ye what is going on, me <LADYLORD>... the wolves that have been in the hills these past years are coming at us, they are!~
@5856 = ~Fer weeks, now, they've been preyin' on us... sneakin' into the village at night and tearin' people apart.  Then their bodies disappear the next night.~
@5857 = ~The first of your thieves is Hanz. He specializes in house breaking and safe cracking. Nobles are a favorite target of his.~
@5858 = ~'Tis a gruesome sight t' be sure.  I've seen 'em, too... them wolves look at me from afar with smarts in their eyes.  'Tis the truth!~
@5859 = ~Name's Groos.  Came into the village with some of the other herders after some of us started being slaughtered... or just plain disappeared.  Herders, farmers... anyone in the outlying lands.~
@5860 = ~The rest of the village is full o' fools!  Them ogres... I seen 'em and they ain't so bad.  And the Umar stuff is nothin' but a load o' nonsense!~
@5861 = ~I be Nelleck... one of the Imnesvale guards, is all.  Wish I could go and do more against 'em wolves, but I can't leave the village alone, true enough.~
@5862 = ~Bloody mayor hired a halfling runt and her troupe to find out what's been happenin'.  They haven't come back... wolves ripped 'em apart is my guess.~
@5863 = ~Alright. How high of a quota should be set for him? This will of course mean burgling more or less houses, so there may be increased risk to him.~
@5864 = ~Led by a big ogre fellow... Madulf,  I think. Wants to be left alone.  Fact that he'd talk first rather than kill ye makes him not th' worst sort in my books.~
@5865 = ~They used t' belong to that big rebel army down in the south o' Amn... deserters likely.  Seen 'em on my patrols... don't look like they're up to anythin'.~
@5866 = ~Yer a mighty respectable sort, I suppose.  I'd've thought it was them wolves causin' the problem... good to know they're gone, too, though.~
@5867 = ~I hears that you set up them ogres to help protect us, too.  I could surely use th' help... an' the merchants are cacklin' like hens at the extra business.~
@5868 = ~They've brought in most of the outlyin' farmers and herders... no one's safe if they're alone for a minute.  And even here ye ain't safe!~
@5869 = ~Me an' Johanna have been tryin' the best we can... fool son Dirbert is jus' goin' to get himself into trouble with no work to do, though.~
@5870 = ~Ay, now... aren't ye the wee halfling lass that the mayor hired?  What happened to all yer other fellas?~
@5871 = ~Dead, good sir.  An ignoble death, as well... I hope you appreciate that they died in an effort to bring your safety.~
@5872 = ~Now... if I could only find me fool son Dirbert.  Some fool bought the boy a sword an' off he ran like a yardape.~
@5873 = ~Now... if I could only find me son Dirbert.  Damn fool somehow got 'hold of ale and is likely off turning some outhouse into a vomitorium.  Ah, well...~
@5874 = ~Now... If I could only find me son, Dirbert.  Damn fool got 'hold of a sword and some ale.  Ran off t' be a bloody adventurer.  Watch, now, he'll be hacked t' pieces by a kobold, no less.~
@5875 = ~Try for the better targets.~
@5876 = ~Try for the homes of nobles.~
@5877 = ~I beg of you, my <LADYLORD>... please help us!  Find out what is killing everyone and put an end to it!~
@5878 = ~I suppose the peace with those ogres is... is good, as well.  I don't know what I will do if I see one of them come to the village, however.  They are so frightening!~
@5879 = ~Hanz is unfortunately dead. There is nothing that can be done for him.~
@5880 = ~Your current instructions should pose very little difficulty for him. I'll wager he would even like more of a challenge.~
@5881 = ~He will not likely appreciate such risky directions, but he will obey them as you command. I'm sure he will prevail against the odds.~
@5882 = ~He is not likely to be too troubled by your directions. Fairly low difficulty for a housebreaker of his skill. I'm sure he will prove quite profitable.~
@5883 = ~Invisibility 10' radius
(Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special 
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None 

This spell causes all creatures within 10' of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so.  Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s). The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~
@5884 = ~How selective should he be in his clientele? It takes quite some time to make sure a job is on the level. More time to research will mean less profit.~
@5885 = ~He should be very selective. I don't want him taking undue risk.~
@5886 = ~He should take his time on the target.~
@5887 = ~Exterminations are the way to go. They will pay better because of the risk.~
@5888 = ~No, I don't want him to waste his talents. Have him seek out... pest removal jobs.~
@5889 = ~Very well. I will inform Goshan of your instructions.~
@5890 = ~No, he can rest for a few days.~
@5891 = ~There is a small amount of risk in the task ahead, but bad luck can always strike. I will wish him well in his duties, and we shall see how he fares.~
@5892 = ~This should be a fairly easy series of tasks for Goshan. We shall see though. Things have gone wrong before.~
@5893 = ~This is a reasonably difficult series of instructions for Goshan, but I'm sure it will all work out in the end.~
@5894 = ~The next of your guild thieves is Kretor. He has a stable of pickpockets below him, and he makes sure that the purses of pedestrians are none too safe.~
@5895 = ~Very well. One last thing; Should he bribe the owners of the establishments he works out of. It is always good if the witnesses are sympathetic to the accused.~
@5896 = ~Go straight for the rich areas. I don't want peasant money.~
@5897 = ~Stay amongst the revelling crowds. They will not notice a thief as easily.~
@5898 = ~I will effect his release then. Do you wish to assign him duties now, or will you wait?~
@5899 = ~He will have to wait.~
@5900 = ~The guidelines you have set mean an easy time for Kretor, though it is never certain how things will come to an end.~
@5901 = ~Your tasks mean a rough few days ahead for Kretor. I'm sure he can manage, but it will be difficult.~
@5902 = ~Things should go well. What you have outlined is not too difficult. We shall see though.~
@5903 = ~The next few days may be a little difficult with what you have ordered. I'm sure it will turn out for the best though.~
@5904 = ~Very well. Morsa prefers to bring in small amounts of items for individuals, as they are harder to detect. But she can bring in large shipments for guilds.~
@5905 = ~Now to contents. She prefers benign substances, but she can get dangerous spell components for mages. These are harder to transport, but they pay higher.~
@5906 = ~She tries to stick to jewels and the like, but she can also bring in dangerous goods for mages and other deviants.~
@5907 = ~I will inform Morsa of your decisions.~
@5908 = ~Morsa is dead. It is a great loss, and there is nothing to be done about it.~
@5909 = ~She will have to wait.~
@5910 = ~The conditions you have set will be extremely dangerous for Morsa. I'm sure she can handle it, but I'll wager it will be difficult.~
@5911 = ~You have one more rogue.  Varia's preferred activity is providing 'protection,' and keeping embarrassing facts about powerful people safe... for a fee.~
@5912 = ~I don't see what all the fuss is about.  'Tis the ogres who have been killing everyone... that's what monsters do!~
@5913 = ~You look like the decent sort who can hold a sword... why don't you go and slaughter those ogres and save us all a lot of trouble?~
@5914 = ~Haha! You are of course joking with me. You know full well that your guild quota must be paid to Renal, lest he take your charter from you.~
@5915 = ~I'll just have her stay as she is. She knows her business, I am sure.~
@5916 = ~My... my poor drunken baby is leading a pair of other boys around the countryside... and he's armed!  Oh, how did this happen?  I'm so worried... those ogres are going to eat him, I just know it!~
@5917 = ~You... I remember you.  You're the ranger who came to buy some food before you went out into the hills, didn't you?  Are... are you replacing Merella?~
@5918 = ~Nay, my lady.  I'd happily settle in your hamlet and be your ranger, but I doubt that it will be my destiny.~
@5919 = ~Ah!  A good day to you, <SIRMAAM>... it is nice to see a new face in the village, for once.  We haven't had many travelers through here since all these killings began, naturally.~
@5920 = ~People don't need to get hurt in these deals.~
@5921 = ~I'd be pleased to show you some of the goods I have to sell, although I must warn you... our mercantile company hasn't had much opportunity to deliver lately, so goods are spare.~
@5922 = ~Ah!  Now that's a tale and a half.  Mind you... don't listen to the dribble these villagers might tell you... they'd have you half-believing that a five-hundred-year-old witch is on the prowl.~
@5923 = ~Always willing to satisfy a customer... with gold, that is.~
@5924 = ~Well... some people still think the problem can be solved.  I hear the mayor hired a band of adventurers to look into it, but they've disappeared.~
@5925 = ~I will inform Varia of your directions.~
@5926 = ~No one wants to travel alone, but if something isn't done soon, they might decide to all leave together.  'Tis a shame... this is a prosperous village otherwise.  Good business, usually.~
@5927 = ~Varia is dead. There is nothing to do but move on.~
@5928 = ~Good to see you again, <SIRMAAM>.  Since you saved this village, things have returned to normal, which is a mighty good thing.  I'm grateful, for one... as is my company.~
@5929 = ~Especially considering the fact that I know you engineered that deal with Madulf and his fellows.  Never would o' thought to sell goods to an ogre, but there it is... and he's a fair bargainer, too.~
@5930 = ~Yes, please... let me see what you have in stock.~
@5931 = ~She should find these conditions relatively easy to meet. I am sure everything will turn out for the best.~
@5932 = ~This will be a relatively difficult set of circumstances for her to overcome. I'm sure she'll be up to the task though.~
@5933 = ~Bah!  Get out of my face, you moronic <RACE>... I could care less for yer wounded feelings.~
@5934 = ~I have nothing to report on the status of your rogues just yet. We must wait until 5 days has elapsed.~
@5935 = ~(sigh)  I just know that one of these days, one of those ogres is going to come down and massacre me, just like those other villagers.  I... I never thought of something like this when I became a merchant!~
@5936 = ~Hanz has returned with a nice profit. His task was dangerous, but his skill has brought him through unscathed.~
@5937 = ~Very well, I will have him released as soon as possible. You will have to reassign him his tasks when I am done reporting on the others.~
@5938 = ~Oh, I suppose so... but there isn't much.  Caravans just won't come here unless they're stocked with guards... and that doesn't make it very profitable, now, does it?~
@5939 = ~Ohhh, it's a terrible thing, isn't it?  People dying left and right... you can hardly find a customer anymore, and that's probably okay because nobody will restock me, now, anyway.~
@5940 = ~Somebody should do something about those ogres, though.  Ever since they came, it all started.  One of my caravans once got attacked by ogres... they're evil and brutal!~
@5941 = ~Let's check on how Goshan did under your instruction.~
@5942 = ~Al-alright... just... just be careful of those hungry ogres!~
@5943 = ~I... I can't tell you how relieved I am that you've stopped all the killings!  I was sure I was a goner!  Maybe now people will start coming back to the village.~
@5944 = ~And... and I met my first ogre face-to-face.  He... he wanted to buy some apples that I had shipped up from my orchard outside Athkatla.  I was sure he was going to eat me, instead, but he didn't.~
@5945 = ~Well, anyway... did you wish to buy something?~
@5946 = ~Goshan has survived all you have put before him and returned with a tidy sum, though I am sure he is not grateful for the risk of his tasks.~
@5947 = ~Then Goshan will stay locked up until you say and pay otherwise.~
@5948 = ~Well, me name's Dale... I do some herdin' out in the fields with the cows and such with me wife, here, and me kids.  Came into the village... just ain't safe anymore out there.~
@5949 = ~I knows two other herders who vanished.  An' the farmers ain't safe, neither.  Farmer Jacob an' his wife were both slaughtered... and then their bodies disappeared.  Turrible things, all.~
@5950 = ~Kretor has proven quite resourceful. Your conditions were difficult, but he has met them and returned with a fair amount of gold.~
@5951 = ~Kretor will rot with the other guttertrash in a pauper's prison until you say otherwise.~
@5952 = ~Kretor has been killed. Nothing more to be said about it.~
@5953 = ~People gets hysterical, they does.  Groos, there, babbles on about that witch... and me daughter, Kaatje, is no better with her stories.  Ye should hear her, heh.~
@5954 = ~It's the ogres... and they'll come an' finish us all off once 'ey've picked us clean to small enough numbers.  We should be fleein' as soon as we can, true enough.~
@5955 = ~You just watch yerself around here... them ogres'll be the death of us all, they will.~
@5956 = ~I think I remember someone mentionin' an old cabin in the hills not far from here, but I don't know anythin' more about it.  Ask Groos, maybe... he goes that way more'n I do.~
@5957 = ~Morsa kept her activities to a minimum, transporting only small amounts of contraband. Her return is accordingly small.~
@5958 = ~Morsa responded well to this level of challenge, and has returned with a tidy sum of gold. It was risky, but she came through just fine in the end.~
@5959 = ~Very well, I will have her released before the day is out. You will have to reassign her tasks to her when I am done reporting on the others.~
@5960 = ~Then she will stay locked up until you can put up the gold.~
@5961 = ~Err... hullo.  Don't meet a lot o' strangers around here.  'Specially as o' late.~
@5962 = ~Varia has been taken prisoner by the guards. They do not approve of her blackmail tactics, and it will cost a 300 gold bribe to get her out.~
@5963 = ~Then Varia will languish in prison until she is freed.~
@5964 = ~Varia is no longer alive. It is a great loss.~
@5965 = ~Now then, that's all of them. Do not forget to give the quota master his dues, or Renal will close down the guild. He does not wait for long.~
@5966 = ~The mayor sent some people out to find out what's happenin'... but I know what's goin' on.  It's Umar... the witch is come back and there ain't no one who goes into the hills going t' come back, now.~
@5967 = ~I knows plenty more than I wants to, believe me.  The murders... skin missin', bodies disappearin'... it's the very things that happened when Umar ruled these lands, y'see.  She's come back.~
@5968 = ~There's lots of land owned by them old families.  They all thought there was mithril, here, long time ago.  Half right, I suppose... there was a little, and it ran out right quick.~
@5969 = ~Little mines and temples went an' got swallowed up by the trees... all the families went an' left it all behind.  Some kept a little piece o' land here an' there... like the cabin yer talkin' about.~
@5970 = ~It's in the hills, it is... not far but inaccessible.  There's a ranger fella that goes out there warned me not to get too close to the cabin.  Set out lots of traps, he says.~
@5971 = ~I gets the sense that the fella's hidin' scared there.  Shame... seems nice enough.  Can't be rich, though... probably just usin' the cabin that was already there.~
@5972 = ~I'd show ya exactly where, but there ain't no way I'm going back into the hills until Umar has had her fill.  Which may be never... so there it is.~
@5973 = ~Okay.  Don't go into the hills, though... just a friendly warnin'.~
@5974 = ~She's a powerful old witch... ruled these hills over five hundred years ago.  Disappeared... no one knows where to, but she's come back, that's for sure.~
@5975 = ~People 'round here... they don't believe me, I know.  But they don't go deep into the hills where I go.  Late at night... ye hears things not o' this world, and it makes ye believe anythin' is possible.~
@5976 = ~Um... hello, my <LADYLORD>.  'Tis a bad time you picked to visit our fair village.~
@5977 = ~My... my name is Margie.  Short for Margaret.  My husband is Dale... one of the herders.  We fled from the outskirts of the village lands because of the wolves.~
@5978 = ~The wolves have picked this year to start in on us people... mauling and stealing corpses.  It has... it has been just ghastly.  They've been around for several years, but they've never been this bad.~
@5979 = ~Everyone gets so upset and frightened... and they start thinking things are happening that aren't.  Some people are blaming the ogre and his band... but they haven't done anything to harm us.~
@5980 = ~The wolves around here have always been a danger... they're large and they're smart.  And they're just a danger once again... that's all there is to it.  People should know better.~
@5981 = ~This is not excited. I am merely eager to receive your guild quota. Renal awaits it. He wishes to see if you are a profitable guild master. If not, someone else will be appointed.~
@5982 = ~I am afraid that I must ask for a total of 1,000 gold this time. Renal demands hard sacrifices from all his guild underlings and you are no different.~
@5983 = ~Once again we must all tighten our belts and pay what we can. Renal asks for a quota of 1,000 gold. It is hard, but fair.~
@5984 = ~Ahh, unfortunately I must ask you for 1,000 gold this week. I know it is a lot, but Renal demands that his guilds all pitch in when the need is great.~
@5985 = ~It is a small amount to pay to support the greater guild as a whole.~
@5986 = ~That is quite a lot, but I will pay it cheerfully.~
@5987 = ~A pleasure doing business with you. Renal will be most pleased with your performance. I wish you well.~
@5988 = ~What if I am unable to get back to the guild?~
@5989 = ~I will pay you as soon as I can.~
@5990 = ~You cannot cast multiple instances of the same contingency spell on yourself.~
@5991 = ~Ahh, you return. Obviously you have come to your senses and will pay the quota that Renal is due.~
@5992 = ~I think 5,000 gold will suffice, don't you? It will more than make up for the payments you have missed.~
@5993 = ~Perhaps 4,000 gold will suffice. It will revitalize my faith in you as a provider for your guild.~
@5994 = ~Well, it's good to have you back with us. Consider your guild resanctioned. Go take good care of it this time.~
@5995 = ~So, you be me new boss then? Fair enough. We ain't had time to talk yet, so let me tells ya something. You be square with me and I'll be square with you.~
@5996 = ~I'm not stressing one bit with the current way things are handled. I think it's a bit of a waste of me talents, but who am I to say.~
@5997 = ~I gotta say, <CHARNAME>, I really appreciates you bribing me back onna street. Don't like them closed-in places one bit. You're okay in my books, you are. Keep the work up good.~
@5998 = ~How did you get into this business of yours, Hanz?~
@5999 = ~Things are currently very easy for me, and I would not mind a quickening of the pace. Of course I would be worried about risk, but I think I can bring success to any mission.~
@6000 = ~Your assistance in freeing me was most appreciated. Be assured that I will work all the harder for the guild. I will serve loyally and without fail. There is no other guild that compares.~
@6001 = ~A pleasure as always, <CHARNAME>. Is there anything I can do to service the guild in any way?~
@6002 = ~And how did you come by the Shadow Thieves?~
@6003 = ~It is only as bloody as you let it get. If I must wash my hands after a kill, I have been less effective than I could have.~
@6004 = ~I knows my place, and I'll do my job as you say. Nothing says I gotta like it. Get on, you've got some guildmaster business or somesuch to do. Don't waste your time talking to me.~
@6005 = ~Things are a little slow right now, but if you think it's best for us to conserve our skill, that's okay by me. It's all up to you.~
@6006 = ~It's pretty boring just sitting around, but if you don't want me out and about, that's okay too. I've been catching up on my reading. Did you know that bats see with sound? Neat.~
@6007 = ~I think my talents are currently wasted here. Playing it safe all around is pointless. The profits are small, and the thrills are nonexistent. Get things moving around here.~
@6008 = ~Now we're up to some fun, though there's more coin out there, I can smell it. We should be risking it all, instead of holding back like some common gutter trash.~
@6009 = ~Just give me a report on how things are going.~
@6010 = ~Ahh, the new guild leader. I trust you will find the facilities to your liking.~ [LATHAN02]
@6011 = ~You are new, so there is little on the agenda just yet. I will try to inform you when something comes up.~
@6012 = ~Nothing to report just yet.~
@6013 = ~My name is Ama, and I am Shadowmaster of eastern Esmeltaran. Here is my signet, I think you'll find it authentic. Now stand aside!~
@6014 = ~What? Ah... yes, m'lady Ama. I meant no offense. Ah, <CHARNAME>, I would suggest you obey proper protocol and present your dagger before your better.~
@6015 = ~Why are you so far afield of your home city?~
@6016 = ~I have come here with a promise of granting his wishes, but I only want to lure him away from his palisade defenses. This is where you come in.~
@6017 = ~I have come to try and end the meddling of a politician that has grown too big for himself.~
@6018 = ~It will be any evening that is best for you. I will await you in Waukeen's Promenade after dark, and then dispense a runner to get Sir Greshal. The suddenness will seem dramatic to him.~
@6019 = ~Just wait a little longer. I'm sure he'll be here soon. He'll want us in full view and unarmed.~
@6020 = ~Ahh, here he comes now.~
@6021 = ~You have fallen for the trap, taken the bait. Now you are vulnerable, and my assassins are in place! Let the Night Masks take you!~
@6022 = ~Er, hello. I... I had you followed and... and I'm awfully sorry about the mess with that Ama person. My informant tells me her cohorts wore the insignia of the Night Masks.~
@6023 = ~We are the knights of honor and good upon Ansalon, a world so far removed from this one.~
@6024 = ~Traps? No, but in the dark rooms of this place I have witnessed horrors.  These terrors I am loathe to discuss but if it helps your cause then I shall.~
@6025 = ~To the west we were ambushed by small creatures, children in size but not in appetite.  We were hard pressed to battle our way out of the trap.~
@6026 = ~Halflings?  If halflings seek to rip and rend the flesh from your body, to swallow your flesh and suck the marrow from your bones, then halflings they may be.~
@6027 = ~Past the bone room you will find a chamber full of magical equipment.  There is one large tube holding a damaged golem that is missing its head and arm.  Whoever sought to repair it was interrupted in his work.~
@6028 = ~That magician's study reminds me of my brother Elic's room, back when he studied to become a wizard.  That room, so alien yet so familiar, stirs me the most.  That said, there was a presence there that... that worried me. I did not scout further than that room.~
@6029 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.  I'll just be leaving now. Bye.~
@6030 = ~Maybe it'll be me who's eating you.~
@6031 = ~There is nowhere to run to now, my prey.~
@6032 = ~Think again.  I'll have digested your heart by day's end.~
@6033 = ~Don't listen to Kaatje... she's always full of stories, she is.~
@6034 = ~I heard that the ranger woman, Merella, is a vampire.  She's gone an' started prowlin' the night, stealin' bodies!~
@6035 = ~My name's Kaatje... I came here with me ma and pa to flee the bad people who are killing everybody.  When I grow up, though, I'm gonna be a mighty warrior an' leave this place for good.~
@6036 = ~I was bringing the cows home a couple o' weeks ago, but I was bringin' them through the path in the woods because it's faster... even though ma doesn't like it when I goes through there.~
@6037 = ~But I passes by the ranger's cabin... Merella's always been real nice to me.  She gives me candies that she says she makes out of tree sap, and she took me fishing once, too.~
@6038 = ~It was so big an' scary... it looked like a wolf-monster.  I was so scared for Merella, so I went an' told me ma and pa... but they didn't believe me an' told me to stop tellin' stories.~
@6039 = ~But it really is true, <SIRMAAM>... honest. If you went to the cabin I bet you'd find something.~
@6040 = ~Haaaaaa... it... it cannot be!  Have... the cowled ones... come for me...?  Have I been... found out... after so long?~
@6041 = ~Hmm... excuse me, maybe I should be going, now.~
@6042 = ~I... I escaped to this place... fled with my pupils... before the Cowled Ones could take me... prisoner.  We... we took what books we could.~
@6043 = ~It was... it was so long ago.  How... long now?  I... I cannot remember.  Are you... hunting for the Cowled Ones?  Have you... come to... destroy me?~
@6044 = ~You... you are not of the Cowled Ones?  That is... that is good.  They... found me out... my pupils and I... practicing the arts... without their permission.  We... we fled... so long ago...~
@6045 = ~Noooo!  NOOOO!!  Not... not after so long!!  I... I will fight you!!~
@6046 = ~Do... do not disturb me, then... and... and tell my... pupils... that I must... must speak to them, now.  They... I... have not spoken to them... it seems like it has been... so looonnnng...~
@6047 = ~Lich?  Lich?  Is... is this what I am?  No... no... was I dying?  I was... dying so long ago... I used the... magic to save myself.  Just as... as I have used it... to save my pupils...~
@6048 = ~How... how long have my pupils... and I... been below?  Do the... wizards still... hunt me?  Is the... name of... Nevaziah still spoken in the world above?~
@6049 = ~I... I do not believe you!  You... you lie!  You... you hunt me... and I must defend myself!  After... after all this time... nooooo!!~
@6050 = ~I... I have been forgotten?  The name of... Nevaziah... Keeper of Wisdom... has been lost to the sands of time?  It... it is as if I have been... in a dream...~
@6051 = ~My... my duty... is long gone.  I... I am dead, am I not?  And... and all my pupils... as well.  Oh... how long has it been?  Hiding... hiding... in fear... for centuries!~
@6052 = ~Thank you... for opening my eyes.  The Keepers never came... to collect the wisdom... my pupils and I... have saved.  They... they are long dead.~
@6053 = ~And... so, too... must the wisdom be destroyed.  Tell me, then... why have you come?  What... what is it that... you have come to this place for?~
@6054 = ~The memories... of the Cowled Ones... has always been long.  But... but how long?  I have... hidden in darkness... for years upon countless years, I think.  And... and no one has come...~
@6055 = ~The... Nether Scroll?  I... I have this... most sacred scroll... here with me.  It is... most dangerous wisdom.  Others must be... protected from it... lest they be destroyed.~
@6056 = ~I... I have used its power... sparingly... but... perhaps not sparingly enough.  What... what makes you think... wizard... that you are strong enough for it?  It... it must be destroyed... with the other knowledge...~
@6057 = ~It is... it is you who... are the fool... wizard!  I... I am the Keeper of Wisdom... and I say... you shall not have it!!~
@6058 = ~The Book of... Kaza?  Yes... yes, I remember... this wisdom.  One of... my pupils... has it, nearby.~
@6059 = ~Is... is he dead?  I... remember an accident... with fire.  I... remember wrapping him in many... bandages... and I used power to... to restore him.  I... I believe so...~
@6060 = ~Go... go to my pupil... in the chamber nearby.  He... he has your Book of Kaza.  Take... take the wisdom from this place... and the rest... the rest shall be destroyed...~
@6061 = ~If it is... treasure... that you seek... then do so quickly.  My pupils... and I... will leave this world... a final time... very shortly.  Treat what... wisdom... remains behind... with great care.~
@6062 = ~My... my thanks... to you.  My... long... long... wait is... over...~
@6063 = ~Haaaa... are you... are you one of my pupils?  Come to... speak to me... after so long?  No... no... I see that you... are not.~
@6064 = ~Are you... the Cowled Ones, then?  Have you... finally found me... after so many long, long... years... centuries... of hunting?  Have you... come to destroy me?~
@6065 = ~The Cowled Ones?  What are you talking about?~
@6066 = ~Um... perhaps I'll just be going again.~
@6067 = ~Me Madulf... lead fellows from great army of Sythsill in the south.  No want to kill races no more.  Lead fellows in desertion.  We just wants be left alone.~
@6068 = ~You're deserters from the Sythillisian Empire?  How do expect to live up here?~
@6069 = ~Well, that's tough... because I'm going to put an end to your evil existence!~
@6070 = ~Nothing... I'll be on my way, I suppose.~
@6071 = ~Wait... you not attack us.  We needs you bring word to human village... humans run when Madulf goes, so me needs you'se to do it for me.  You'se bring word, yes?~
@6072 = ~Soon after we come, fellows begin to vanish.  One, two, they go.  Some turn up killed... skin missing.  Some bodies vanish, too.  Madulf no know who killing us.~
@6073 = ~Madulf worried... numbers get smaller.  We like here, but something bad is here, too, killing us fellows.  Very bad.~
@6074 = ~I don't believe you!  Time to face your punishment!~
@6075 = ~Is very hard.  Humans hates us, and we just wants to be left alone.  Some humans call knights, who chase us... it not bad here, but Madulf thinks village will call knights soon.  Humans very mad.~
@6076 = ~Well, I may not be a knight... but I'll end your evil existence just as quickly!~
@6077 = ~I see... well, I'll be going, then.~
@6078 = ~Madulf no want death... Madulf no want fight.  Just want peace.  You tell villagers, maybe, that Madulf and fellows will protect village... protect from orcs in mountains, yes?~
@6079 = ~Humans let us stay, then, and no call knights.  Maybe let us come, once in a moon, to trade for food and goods.  Madulf make deal with village, if you'se tell them... we no want trouble.~
@6080 = ~Is too bad, then.  Soon, humans will call knights and Madulf be forced to go elsewhere.  You'se change mind, you'se come back to Madulf, okay?~
@6081 = ~But you'se can go... Madulf and fellows no want trouble.  No fighting you'se.~
@6082 = ~Madulf no knows.  Maybe wolves.  Maybe bad magics.  Nobody see what kills fellows.  Comes at night, though... maybe is the shadows.~
@6083 = ~I see.  So your band is no better off than the village.  I'll be going, then.~
@6084 = ~Madulf and fellows like here.  But something bad killing fellows.  Lose one, two maybe, at a time.  Disappear, bodies too.  Very bad... Madulf very worried.~
@6085 = ~Madulf happy.  Maybe fellows can live alone and eat good, be happy here.  You do good thing... maybe humans agree.  Madulf keep deal, you tell them.~
@6086 = ~Very well, Madulf... I will bring your proposal to the mayor.~
@6087 = ~Forget it... I haven't changed my mind.~
@6088 = ~Actually, I have decided to end your sorry existence... humans will never live with your kind!~
@6089 = ~Is good.  Madulf thinks maybe he and fellows can stay... live in peace, maybe.  If humans not hunt us down, that is.  We protect... we keep word.~
@6090 = ~Madulf not happy.  We keep word, <RACE>, why you decide not to tell village?  Madulf cannot tell village, himself... they run away in fear.  Will just bring knights soon.~
@6091 = ~You change mind, come speak to Madulf again.  Madulf and fellows willing to protect village from orcs in mountains, if they want.  We do that, and trade.  You come again.~
@6092 = ~Madulf and fellows owe you much... we can stay and be left alone, here.  Is good.  Here... have shield to give you... is magic, from Sythsill army... we no use.  Maybe you like.~
@6093 = ~Why you do this?!  Untrustworthy <RACE>!!  Kill <RACE>... KIIILLL!!~
@6094 = ~We likes you'se... you'se done good for us fellows!~
@6095 = ~Grrrr... we no harm... grrrrrrr... no want trouble... grrrrr... you speak Madulf... grrrrr grrrrrowl!~
@6096 = ~Grrrr grrrrr... you help us... grrrowl!  Welcome here... grrrrr~
@6097 = ~This is half of a page of parchment, yellowed with age.  Its ink is faded but still legible, and reads:

"This land near the Umar Hills is rich with mithril deposits, and I notice many other prospectors have joined me here to plunder its riches.  So, too, have scoundrels and bandits been attracted to the area, and they prey mercilessly upon us.  I have found an excellent hiding place for my mithril cache, one which even those thieves will never be able to locate.  It is far to the east of the Imnesvale village, in a forest --"

Beneath this section, the page is torn and jagged as if it has been ripped from its other half.~
@6098 = ~Er...<PRO_SIRMAAM>?  My name is Dirbert and me an' my friends here want to be adventurers like you.  Real strong an' powerful, like.~
@6099 = ~I knows we can!  But... everyone says we're all too young an' all.~
@6100 = ~Since... since you're already an adventurer an' all, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I was hopin'... I was hopin' you might maybe... maybe buy some swords for us?  Some bastard swords?~
@6101 = ~Er... swords and some ale, then.  If... if we give you th' money, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, would you buy us some?~
@6102 = ~I'll buy you ale, boys... but you'd just cut yourselves with a sword in your hands.~
@6103 = ~Merciful beings of light!  I offer you a simple exchange.  Information on what you seek in exchange for my freedom.~
@6104 = ~Great!  Gee, thanks, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!  You're the greatest!  Here... here's the gold we've saved.  Get us three bastard swords, I guess, and a keg of Baalor's ale from Min Minling.~
@6105 = ~O-okay... with three bastard swords, we could at least become adventurers!  Here's some of the gold we've saved up.  Thanks, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!  You're the greatest!~
@6106 = ~No, we wouldn't!  We know how to use swords!  But... but if you'd buy us some ale, that'd be super.  Here's some gold we've saved up for it...~
@6107 = ~Awww... please?  Please?  Pretty please?~
@6108 = ~I said no... and I still mean it!~
@6109 = ~So... have you got our stuff?~
@6110 = ~Yeah, I got your swords... and some ale for you, too.~
@6111 = ~Well, I didn't get your swords... but I did buy you some ale.~
@6112 = ~Yes, I got your ale... and I got you some bastard swords, as well.~
@6113 = ~Well, I didn't get your ale... but I did get you some swords.~
@6114 = ~Alright... I guess we'll wait a bit longer for it.  We're mighty anxious to start our adventurin', though.~
@6115 = ~My wolves? Hah! No longer, fool. The pack has fallen under the fell magicks of the Shade Lord.  Your hunting has gone awry.~
@6116 = ~We find Mister Ployer distasteful, even in comparison to others of his ilk. It would not disturb us to... make other arrangements around that task in the future.~
@6117 = ~This place was not always like this... floating in a false and unholy darkness. It began only a short time ago.~
@6118 = ~I... I don't (hic!) feeelll welll...~
@6119 = ~... Ize being (hic!) sooooo glahd ti seeze ye... (hic!)  yooze soooo neyce ti usssz beyssz... (hic!)~ [DRUNK1]
@6120 = ~Only those that are distasteful. For not participating in Ployer's little exercise we might charge... oh... one thousand gold pieces.~
@6121 = ~For not participating in Ployer's little exercise we might charge... oh... one thousand gold pieces. This is a much lower figure than the original service cost.~
@6122 = ~Pleeze, mercy on us!  Me sorry.  Don't kill.  Me just following orders.  Didn't want to eat children or kick old people.  Just job!~
@6123 = ~Foul orc!  You will suffer the same fate as all your kind!~
@6124 = ~Tank yous tank yous.  I promising, no more killings here.  Not as job, anyway.  Maybe hobby. That okay, I think.~
@6125 = ~Oh, don't beg. Begging just makes me ill.~
@6126 = ~You have nothing I wish to know! Die as you should!~
@6127 = ~Falik at your service.  My companion Grancor needs help with finding a... a I can't remember what, but if you talk to him he'll tell you.~
@6128 = ~The grill.  That big metal thing.  Jump on.  Be careful, it's hot!~
@6129 = ~What is this place?~
@6130 = ~What is this place that you have built?~
@6131 = ~Beneath the grime you can make out the words 'Copper Coronet'.~
@6132 = ~I hear you might have a sword I seek. It should have spider-like patterns on it.~
@6133 = ~Ain't excited. I just wants ya to leave. Bossmen won't take kindly to us speaking to strangers while we's supposed to be working.~
@6134 = ~Yeah, so get going before we have to call the guards.~
@6135 = ~Now, just a minute there. Ain't no call for that. I mean, be awfully hard for you to stay all nice and pretty if we let the city's blasted sewers back up. You should thank us.~
@6136 = ~Yeah, we do good work, so you take your high n' mighty and get packin'. Get outta here.~
@6137 = ~I'll pay you 1,000 gold, no questions asked.~
@6138 = ~No, I'll stick with the 50 gold I offered.~
@6139 = ~200! Cripes a'mighty, you got a deal!~
@6140 = ~You right, it's not ours. It's mine! I gots it, I'm packing it around, I gotta scare the spiders, so I'm sellin' it and you get squat. 200 is more than I make in years! Here! Take it!~
@6141 = ~Yeah, right. You just happen to have 1,000 gold layin' about. I ain't that stupid. Get lost.~
@6142 = ~Yeah, you have a pretty weird sense of humor. 1,000 gold is more than I ever seen. Get lost, funny<MANWOMAN>.~
@6143 = ~That works too. Here you go.~
@6144 = ~Sorry, but it's city property and I can't give it up.~
@6145 = ~I was wondering if you had found a sword with spider-like etchings on it?~
@6146 = ~There have always been losses, but now there are even more. The workers of the city have found some fell weapon that smites the spiders most unfairly.~
@6147 = ~We must help her. Spiders are the most perfect creatures.~
@6148 = ~We will not help.~
@6149 = ~Good. Then go, and find the accursed blade that kills my charges. I would go myself, but my half-drow blood would be my death if I were seen.~
@6150 = ~The blade is called Spider's Bane, and it is in the hands of the workers that clean the ducts and sewers. They lodge next to the prison, on its north side. Go.~
@6151 = ~Filthy... bugs... filthy... chhhhclclclcl...~
@6152 = ~Oh... greetings to you, stranger.  (sigh)~
@6153 = ~My name is Daar and I... I am no one of importance, I suppose.  At least, nobody important enough that my love's father might vaguely consider allowing me to court her.  (sigh)~
@6154 = ~My love is Colette, and her father is a wizard of no small power... and possessed of considerable bias against me.~
@6155 = ~His name is Jermien... and I understand he intends to use Colette as a bargaining tool for some wizardly endeavour of his own.  Against her will, I imagine... although I've had no chance to ask her opinion.~
@6156 = ~I could remove her father from the equation... for a price.~
@6157 = ~It would be of no use, I am sure.  And I do not wish to use violence in such an endeavour... I do not appreciate its taste, and no doubt Jermien would crush me with magic.~
@6158 = ~I... I have no wish to use violence, my <LADYLORD>.  Jermien loves his daughter, in his own way, and I've no right.  But less harsh methods are not likely to work, either.~
@6159 = ~I am <GABBER>... who are you?~
@6160 = ~Forget it... I'll be on my way.~
@6161 = ~And I, since you ask, am none other than Jermien... licensed Cowled Wizard for this region.  So you needn't run off and attempt to report me, <GIRLBOY>.~
@6162 = ~What is this... thing... you're making?~
@6163 = ~Er... Daar didn't send me, but I did talk to him.  Why don't you give him a break?~
@6164 = ~I don't do anything about it because I don't want to do anything about it.  I have more important things to do... and until the Cowled Wizards tell me otherwise, I'll not involve myself.~
@6165 = ~It's likely wolves or ogres or some other mundane nonsense... I've no interest in the matter.  Why don't you ask some of the yokels, if you're so concerned?~
@6166 = ~Few other mages have made the attempt, you see.  This type of golem is quite powerful and dangerous... but I am more than skilled enough to control it.~
@6167 = ~Once it's complete, I'll have an excellent servant... and something to keep an eye on my daughter and that foolhardy beau of hers while I am away.~
@6168 = ~Trouble is, I'm missing one of the crucial ingredients... the blood of a mimic.  I'd pay handsomely for some, in fact.  Hmmmn... you look like the adventurous type... care to find me some?~
@6169 = ~Hmph!  I've far more important things in mind for Colette than that fool, Daar.  She'll get over her childish infatuation, I assure you... and Daar will be long gone.~
@6170 = ~A mimic is a vicious little creature... shapechanger... that likes to attract and kill adventurers by looking like a treasure chest or similar objects.~
@6171 = ~Very well... I'll make the attempt.~
@6172 = ~Alright... I'll make the attempt.~
@6173 = ~Forget it... I'm not interested in your task.~
@6174 = ~I've spoken to Daar... why don't you give him a break?~
@6175 = ~No, I don't... but I intend to find some.~
@6176 = ~No, I don't... and I don't intend on looking for it, anymore, either.~
@6177 = ~Eh?  Let me have a look at what you have, there.  Yes... yes... I see.  Well done, <GIRLBOY>, well done!  I don't know how you found it, but here it is!~
@6178 = ~I took the liberty of digging out that sword, earlier, just in case.  Rather prophetic of me, don't you think?  It was just collecting dust, anyway... so here you go and well earned, I might add.~
@6179 = ~Now... all I need to do is add this to the golem and he will be complete!  Finally, I will be able to leave in peace and be assured that Colette will not be molested while I am gone!~
@6180 = ~Well, it's no less than I expected.  Perhaps you should go find some simpler pursuits for yourself, <GIRLBOY>... like, say, farming or something similar.~
@6181 = ~... Mmm... mmmMMMWWaarrRR?~
@6182 = ~Y-yes... I am alive, my daughter.  Thanks to our kind stranger, here...~
@6183 = ~One of my own creations turned on me, boy.  It... it seems I am not so wise and powerful as I had first thought.~
@6184 = ~And... perhaps I have been foolish in some of my other decisions, as well.  Daar... boy... if you promise to take care of my daughter, and protect her... if you still want her... I'll not stand in the way.~
@6185 = ~Indeed.  Thank you, Jermien.  I shall take excellent care of Colette, you can be sure.  Come, my love... let's not waste this chance.~
@6186 = ~My thanks to you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, for saving a foolish wizard's life.  (sigh)  My daughter is now gone... I think I will leave, myself, for a while and consider what I have done.~
@6187 = ~Daar!  Daar, it was terrible!  One... one of father's creations... it turned on him!  And... and now he's dead!~
@6188 = ~I never meant your father any harm, my love.  But his pride killed him in the end.  Come... let us away from here, and I will protect you in his stead.~
@6189 = ~A-alright... I just... I just wish father had...~
@6190 = ~My thanks to you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... whoever you are.  Without your aid, the creature would have certainly killed Colette, as well.  I wish you well.~
@6191 = ~(sigh)  Father will never let me marry Daar.  That is all I wish to do... I don't know why he won't change his mind!~
@6192 = ~I love Daar... but father will have none of it!  Now he's making this... thing... to watch over me when he leaves!  This is just terrible!~
@6193 = ~There're a lot o' things t' be said about yer inn, Vince... but 'humble' ain't the one I would be pickin', aye?~
@6194 = ~Ah, Vincenzo knows the truth!  My family has been in this here area for a long, long time... an' the tales of the witch, Umar, have been passed down, they have!~
@6195 = ~I thought that'd shut yer trap.  Now, then, me <LADYLORD>... I can tell ye all about th' witch, Umar... a tale sure to curl yer ears, if ye'd care to hear it.~
@6196 = ~Go ahead... I've got the time.~
@6197 = ~Of course, of course!  I've not many rooms, mind you... all th' frightened folk who've fled into the village have near filled me up.  Only a room or two left.~
@6198 = ~Silence, boy!  There are no foulsome rodents here other than you!  (ahem)  Ah... now, my <LADYLORD>...~
@6199 = ~... That's if ye can stand th' stench...~
@6200 = ~I jus' took one this morning, Vince... but yer a peach fer offerin'.~
@6201 = ~Umar was a wicked one. No one e'er saw her except when she came down from the hills to steal some unfortunate soul. Shepherds, babes... anyone who weren't careful.~
@6202 = ~She'd torture 'em, ye could hear their cries durin' the night.  People tried to find her, but only the victims' bodies would turn up... mutilated an' dead.~
@6203 = ~I'm warning ye, boy... ye'll be out on yer arse faster than ye can blink, if ye keeps this up!~
@6204 = ~Well, there was a group o' mages some years back who came.  Young ones... apprentices, I gathered.  Two fellas and a young lass, sure enough.~
@6205 = ~Well... thanks for the story, I suppose.~
@6206 = ~Aye, true enough.  Them three went into th' Hills... an' they was ne'er found again.  'Cept for the lass' journals... I found those meself, out in the woods.~
@6207 = ~Aye, ye can... I had a copy or two done up by a scribe friend o' mine some months back.  Ye can have one, if ye likes.~
@6208 = ~Well, so what if I have?  'Tis a good story, more or less!  Make me bloody rich one day... an' then where will ye be, ye little rugrat?~
@6209 = ~I did nay such thing!  Here ye go, me <LADYLORD>... use it as ye will.  But beware the witch if ye goes into the hills.  She's not sated yet... not by a longshot...~
@6210 = ~Not at all, not at all... glad to see that there's people willin' to listen to it.~
@6211 = ~Watch it, ye little bugbear, or I'll dunk ye in a trough an leave ye to rot in the sun!  Now... me <LADYLORD>... was there somethin' else ye wanted?~
@6212 = ~Egad!  Somebody actually wants t' hear his cockamamie tripe?~
@6213 = ~Of course, me <LADYLORD>... more'n happy t' offer ye anything under me roof.  Things are kind o' quiet, now that the murders have ended... not that I'm complainin'.~
@6214 = ~Magical currents are embedded inside this bullet so that it seems a little more balanced and lighter as it jumps towards an opponent.  When the bullet strikes an opponent it explodes in a flash of fire.

@6218 = ~One should beware of walking in the Slums and the Bridge District late at night... footpads and muggers openly attack you, amongst other forms of trouble.~
@6219 = ~The Churches of Lathander and Talos are in a constant fight for dominance in the city... many believe this will soon lead to open war.~
@6220 = ~Clerics throughout the city are disappearing ... only to be reappear with their eyes plucked out, claiming to have joined a new religion devoted to 'the Unseeing Eye'.~

@6222 = ~The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart is an order of lawful warriors that serves all of Amn.  They can be called to duty anywhere evil threatens.~
@6223 = ~There have been a series of murders in the Bridge District.  Victims have been found with the flesh flayed from their bodies... the murderer is still at large.~

@6225 = ~I offer a grand sum, worthy of a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your stature. I offer 10,000 gold if you can free my land of this scourge. It is a fortune, you will agree.~
@6226 = ~Ten thousand? That is an astounding sum for simple monster hunting.~
@6227 = ~Athkatla is ruled by the Council of Six... their identities are secret so no-one knows who to bribe.  The Council is currently not in session, so the Vice-Consul rules.~
@6228 = ~The colony of New Amn in Maztica is growing dangerous.  The natives are rebelling against their masters... the Council might send in reinforcements.~
@6229 = ~The rival guild is rumored to have been wiped out by the Shadow Thieves.  The Shadow Thieves were far more numerous... and brook no competition.~
@6230 = ~The Shadow Thieves' victory over its rival guild is rumored to be due to the aid of several independent master thieves in the city... something the Shadow Thieves hotly deny.~
@6231 = ~The leaders of the Shadow Thieves have been assassinated... but the victorious rival guild has vanished, cutting off reprisal from the larger Shadow guild.~
@6232 = ~The Council of Six is reeling since the Shadow Thieves were destroyed by rivals in the city... the guild had secretly ruled Athkatla for decades and the Council is now at a loss.~
@6233 = ~The murders in Imnesvale have been caused by a group of monsters that have camped in the regions, deserters from the Sythillisian Empire led by an ogre named Madulf.~
@6234 = ~Many blame the murders in the village on the band of wolves that have been active in the region for the last several years... supposedly led by an actual werewolf.~
@6235 = ~Shepherds and farmers from outlying areas are relieved that the wolf pack has been disbanded and the werewolf destroyed... flocks will be safe once again.~
@6236 = ~Some say the witch Umar has surfaced again.  She vanished seven hundred years ago, but legend holds that every century or so her reign of murder and torture begins again.~
@6237 = ~A few centuries ago bands of mithril were discovered and mined.  Temples sprung up and wealthy Amnish families bought land... it was all abandoned when the mithril ran out.~
@6238 = ~You are the choice I make, and the offer stands whether you go now or not. There is no other decision that makes sense.~
@6239 = ~Imnesvale's mayor, Lloyd Wainwright, needs more adventurers to seek the source of the village's problems.  A group led by the knight Mazzy Fentan disappeared several weeks ago.~
@6240 = ~A month ago, Lady Lilith Lurraxol convinced the Athkatlan Council to sell her sole license for fur sales in Trademeet.  Lord Skarmaen Alibakkar was reportedly incensed!~

Flamerule 7
Kaatje came to visit again.  A sweet child, eager to learn my ways with the wild creatures.

Flamerule 12
Dark creatures roam the forests.  Several townspeople have been slain by some unknown predator.  Everyone seems to have their own opinion of what is doing the killing.  The strangest thing is that the bodies are disappearing in the morning.  This leaves me baffled, for most signs point to a pack of wolves that have been in the area for a long time.  Wolves don't steal bodies.

Flamerule 13
Or perhaps I should say wolf-like creatures.  At night while I've been patrolling I've often caught shadowy glimpses of these 'wolves' running alongside me.  I've tried to attract their attention but they ignore me.  I find this most strange, as if the pack is being controlled by someone else.  Years ago I spoke with the pack leaders and they were cordial.  Now they either flee from me, or, and I fear to say this, they stalk me.

Flamerule 21
It is near noon and still the wood outside my cabin seems full of shadows.  I've been hard pressed to hear birds and most of the larger animals have long fled.  I plan to find the wolf's den (this afternoon). I've drawn a map to it.  All signs point to them as being the culprits, but what wolves act like these?  They are wolves with the cunning of men.
And there is something else, a whispering in my mind.  It is faint now, in the waking hours, but while I sleep I dream only of this voice and the face behind it.  Whether it is connected to the voices, I do not know.  I suspect by the time that the sun sets tonight I'll have answers to my questions.~
@6250 = ~I knew you would not let me down.  The compound is not far from here... a dry-docked boat just across the way on the east side of the slums.~
@6251 = ~The compound is not far from here... a dry-docked boat just across the way to the east side of the slums.~
@6252 = ~I do not know. Perhaps you slighted him in some way, without even knowing. He seems quite singleminded in his purposes.~
@6253 = ~What I do know is that he is not the worst of your worries. The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart will seek your death if something is not done quickly.~
@6254 = ~I have friends among the Order. I will speak with them as quickly as possible. Perhaps I can persuade them to look on you with mercy. I can but try.~
@6255 = ~Father has much faith in you, that you are genuinely pained at what has happened. Faith is very important to him. Please do not disappoint him.~
@6256 = ~That is how my father felt. He claims he has found his way again, but I know he doubts. If you can, give the doubt back to Jierdan. Father would not ask, but I will.~
@6257 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot.  As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant.  He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match.  Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak.  His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree.  That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth.  He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero.  Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".
It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence.  If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity.  He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.
As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away.  Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah!  Got 'im good", and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something" is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

@6258 = ~Freeing the djinn.

To retrieve what is in possession of the djinn Malaaq, I must first secure his release by obtaining the twin to the flask he is bound to.  He informed me that the flask is kept close to his master... either in his chambers or in the possession of some dryads or golems.~
@6259 = ~I do not feel impressive. I have lost my honor to a lie.~
@6260 = ~Your words flatter, but I am undeserving.~
@6261 = ~Find a way to release Minsc from his cell.

Minsc, too, is kept captive in the same room I was.  Obviously our captors fear his strength, as his cell is welded shut; there is no lock to pick and no key to find. I don't know how I will get him out.~

It appears the sewage golem will open the doors in the dungeon if I find an activation stone... it is on a table near someone named Rielev.~

I have found the mother of the boy outside the tent.  Now I must see if I can restore her to her original form... along with the rest of this mad circus.~
@6265 = ~You know nothing of me. You base your assumptions on storybooks and legend.~
@6266 = ~Free Hendak and the slaves.

It appears that the Copper Coronet is keeping slaves to perform its entertainments... I have talked to a slave by the name of Hendak and agreed to free his people.  I will need a key that is currently held by the beastmaster located across the arena.~
@6267 = ~Free Hendak and the slaves.

I have freed the slaves of the Copper Coronet... only to find that there are yet more slaves being held in a dry-docked ship on the east side of the slums.  Hendak mentioned there was a tunnel in the sewers that leads from the inn to the ship, but he didn't know exactly where it was.~
@6268 = ~Er, not as such.~
@6269 = ~AXE:  There are two varieties of axes: throwing axes and battle axes.  This proficiency class allows your character to use either.

@6270 = ~TWO HANDED SWORD: 

NOTE:  Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts.  This counter balances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two-handed weapon.  The Holy Avenger and Vorpal sword are examples of weapons that are two-handed.

The hallmark of the traditional muscle bound warrior is the two-handed sword.  This proficiency class allows you to use these heavy swords to mangle your opponents.

@6272 = ~TWO HANDED:  

NOTE:  Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts.  This counter balances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two handed weapon.  The Holy avenger and Vorpal sword are examples of weapons that are two-handed.  

This weapon class allows the character to use a two-handed melee weapon and receive special bonuses.  If one slot is spent on this proficiency the wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage and a -2 bonus to speed when using a two-handed weapon.  A second slot spent on this proficiency gives a further -2 bonus to speed while wielding two-handed weapons.  The character will also score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20). Two-handed missile weapons (bows and crossbows) are not affected by this proficiency.~
@6273 = ~Solve the riddle in the sewers.

According to Quallo, Vallah's hand represents suffering... which is of prime importance.  Presumably he is referring to its order in the pipes.~
@6274 = ~SWORD AND SHIELD:  Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this proficiency an adventurer can maximize the benefits received.  One slot spent gives a -2 bonus to AC against missile weapons.  Another slot spent increases the bonus to a total of -4.

NOTE:  Despite the name of this skill, any one-handed weapon in combination with a shield will receive the bonuses given by this skill.~
@6275 = ~SINGLE WEAPON:  This weapon class is for characters who do not wish to use a shield but want some bonus when using a one-handed melee weapon.  With one slot spent on this proficiency, the wielder gets a -1 bonus to AC and inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20, if using a single weapon.  A second slot increases the AC bonus to a total of -2. One-handed missile weapons (such as slings) are not affected by this proficiency.~
@6276 = ~You could do much to bolster my father's spirit. Bringing that Firkraag to task would help a lot. Please, if not for my father, then for yourself.~

@6278 = ~Basic armor made of thick, wax or water-hardened leather.  It is sturdy protection, not supple like boots or a cloak.  Soft garment leathers like that would offer no more protection than common clothing.  Magical enchantments have improved the protective abilities of this particular suit.

@6280 = ~Meeting with Valen's mistress.

A strange woman has approached me and told me that another party is interested in aiding me, alluding to the fact that my current allies are not to be trusted... if I am interested, I am to meet her mistress at night in the Graveyard District and speak with her further.~
@6281 = ~I cannot imagine the horror, having had your will usurped in the trickery my father described. I know you will prevail though. Your spirit must surely be boundless.~
@6282 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Mae'Var has accepted me into his guild readily enough... and has given me my first task: steal a golden statuette from the temple of Lathander.  It must be done quietly, and I am to return to Mae'Var with it once the deed is done.~
@6283 = ~You see things through inexperienced eyes, m'lady. I only wish it were so.~
@6284 = ~It is a time-honored tradition, or so the books say. I just want to restore some grandeur to your position. You shoulder the weight that others might walk unencumbered.~
@6285 = ~The return to Harper Hold.

I met up with Jaheira at the Harper Hold, and she relayed to me that the Harpers there were not truly Harpers anymore... the lack of the specters on the second floor attested to this.  She suggested that perhaps this was a splinter group seeking revenge, but was not sure.

I was willing to take her out of the place, but not to have her rejoin with my group.  Disappointed and perhaps angry that I would leave her in a trap, she left to escape on her own.  I doubt I will see her again.~
@6286 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Embarl mentioned that he had overheard Mae'Var planning on assassinating Renal... I wonder if this is something Renal would want to hear.  Regardless, I've no proof to offer him.~
@6287 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Embarl is dead, for good or ill... I will need to bring Mae'Var his dagger in order to prove that the deed is done.~
@6288 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Mae'Var trusts me well enough, and has accepted me into the guild.  Perhaps now I have time to look around and see if there is any evidence to be had.  Edwin might know something, but only if it is in his best interests, I am sure.~
@6289 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Edwin assures me that the letter I have taken from Mae'Var's room is the right one... and has bade me go to Renal with great speed!~
@6290 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

Mae'Var has been exposed and his execution ordered... once he is dead I must return to Renal and tell him that the deed is done.~
@6291 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The lieutenant mentioned that there was a series of grisly murders occurring in the Bridge District.  Someone is murdering the poor in the streets and removing their skins in a hideous fashion.  He mentioned that a child, Faraji, saw the most recent victim... and also mentioned a beggar, Rampah, and a courtesan, Rose, as being involved in his investigation somehow.~
@6292 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The courtesan, Rose, thought she remembered a smell at the murder scene... she said it was akin to guril berries, but couldn't place it exactly.  She directed me to Bel, a merchant, who she stated would know more about things that smelled like the berries and offered to differentiate between the odors that Bel thought of.~
@6293 = ~Bandits! I saw them! Coming! They try not to be seen, but I saw them! Nearly here! Hide and run!~
@6294 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The boy, Faraji, claimed that the victim who was killed was a man by the name of Bilver, and that the fellow had no enemies to speak of.  The boy seemed sure that the person responsible was a 'witch' by the name of Missus Cragmoon and that I should go and speak to her... although her so-called crimes seem fairly innocent.~
@6295 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

I spoke to Missus Cragmoon... it seems that, while she is a magic-user (the boy was apparently right about the witch part), she doesn't seem to have anything at all to do with the murders.~
@6296 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

The merchant, Bel, identified the strange piece of leather as elephant hide.  Certainly difficult to find in this city, although Bel thought that a tanner might be able to get ahold of some.  He also mentioned that a circus was in town... while he didn't know if they had elephants or not, the circus animal tamer might also be one who could get such a hide.~
@6297 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

Bel told me that there were three things that smelled like guril berries: guril berries, themselves, as well as oak bark and solik berries.  He gave me a sample of each... with which I can probably go back to Rose and get her to compare the odors.~
@6298 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

I informed the lieutenant that the murderer had tannin on him as well as the elephant hide, and the lieutenant decided that the tanner must be responsible for the murders and left to check the matter out.  He went by himself... I certainly hope that the lieutenant will be alright.~
@6299 = ~What manner of bandits are you? You have orcs among your number!~
@6300 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

Rejiek was obviously responsible for the murders, according to his own words... and the wizard, Vellin Dahn, in the back of his shop was allied with him and spoke of a larger work that was being performed.  I am unsure if this ends here or not, but the Tanner has certainly escaped for now. The mage must have spirited him away.~
@6301 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

It seems that Dennis isn't quite the culprit Vittorio made him out to be.  Vittorio stole the man's gong... or at least his mother's... and I have agreed to go and find the gong and return it.  Vittorio says that he sold it to a fence by the name of Roger, who has his shop in the sewers.  Dennis will hold onto Vittorio until I return with the gong, apparently.~
@6302 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

Well, finally!  Drush the ogre mage DOES have the gong... he's using it to shovel cow dung, of all things (and, really, what else is a gong good for?) and he's not about to part with it for anything less than a Wand of Frost.  He suggested that Adratha, a witch who lives next to him, might have one... but any wand of frost would really do.~
@6303 = ~Recover Dennis' mother's gong.

Drush gave me the gong (and WHEW does it stink!)... I suppose all that remains, now, is to return it to Dennis at Delosar's in Athkatla.~
@6304 = ~Yes, very busy.  And so are your clothes... very vividly red, in fact.~
@6305 = ~Lady Jysstev, I must ask a favor of you. There is a little girl that is sick and I think that you may have knowledge that can help her... I need to find the Hidden.~
@6306 = ~My daughter is gone!  I left this place in your care! I... I... no, no, I know it was not you...  I know who my enemies are. Damn that Jierdan Firkraag! What is his grief with me?!~
@6307 = ~This must end! I cannot live under his shadow, under... his heel!~ [GARREN07]
@6308 = ~Put the spirit of the child Wellyn to rest.

I encountered the restless spirit of a small boy, Wellyn, in the graveyard and agreed to return his stuffed bear to him so that he might be at peace.  According to the spirit, the bear (named Littleman... I suppose every halfling child must have a toy named Littleman, if you think about it) is in the possession of the thief who murdered the child... the thief's name is Llynis and is in one of the rooms at the Copper Coronet.~
@6309 = ~What? Is that your only concern? My child is taken and you think only of yourself? Are you sure it was the illusions that dishonored you?~
@6310 = ~I will take vengeance for you as well, no matter where he hides!~
@6311 = ~I... uh... sorta got your child killed. Me bad.~
@6312 = ~Ehh, all gone to hell in handbasket. Your child is dead and the villain lives.~
@6313 = ~The hero retreats! You are very bad at this game, <CHARNAME>. Cower as you will, I will wait and watch while you live with your cowardice. I have the patience of a thousand years behind!~
@6314 = ~Locate a caretaker for the orphan, Risa.

Arenthis, the priest, seems to think that the paladin I encountered... Kamir was his name... might make an excellent guardian for his orphaned girl.  Kamir thinks himself responsible for his son's death... perhaps he might see this as some kind of atonement... who knows?~
@6315 = ~A Cult of the Eyeless?

Some form of new religion or cult has been formed in the city, centered on a god called 'the Unseeing Eye'.  A priest of some kind whose own eyes were missing spoke to a crowd, calling on them to shed their 'false sight' and join in the worship of this new god.~
@6316 = ~Illithium!!?? He told you?? That drunken fool! That simpering idiot! That ale-guzzling worm farmer! Where is he? I'll kill him! (Won't rescue me but will send a bunch of surfacers to loot the place...)~
@6317 = ~As you must know, these ruins have been invaded by a group of beasties and something enormous has made its home below us. Is they way clear behind you? Is there a safe way out?~
@6318 = ~I'm not sure what it is. It burned its way through the very earth and now has made its home in a cavern below us. I'm happy to avoid it. Now tell me, is there a safe way out of this prison?~
@6319 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I have agreed to investigate the cult of this 'Unseeing Eye' for Mornmaster Arval, high priest of the temple of Lathander.  I must investigate as I see fit, infiltrating 'as friend or foe.'  The temple of the cult lies far below ground, apparently, and there should be a passage to it from the sewers... although the Mornmaster could not say exactly where.  The Mornmaster also offered me the services of his church, with regards to healing and equipment, should I need them.~
@6320 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I have informed Oisig of the nature of this beholder cult... and he has commanded me to return to the temple below and destroy the creature.   I am unsure how this is to be accomplished, but it must be done somehow.~
@6321 = ~Investigate and destroy the Cult of the Eyeless.

I've stumbled across Sassar, who was once the high priest for the beholder until he learned of the creature's true intentions.  It has come to this place to recover a piece of a powerful rod that lies in the dungeons below, the match to the piece it already has.  Many in the cult have been sent below to make the attempt, and all have apparently failed.
Sassar claims that the gods cursed the rod because of its great power, but he couldn't tell me more.  He did say, however, that the only way to destroy the beholder would be to use the rod against it. I must retrieve the part of the rod below and then Sassar will tell me how to steal the other half from the beholder.~
@6322 = ~Keep laughing at poor Gorje, abondoned by his fear-filled twerp of a brother. Listen fool! These creatures are the reason why this cavern of ours has no more value. Our shipping routes are closed unless you've carved a path to the door.~
@6323 = ~Chain mail is made of interlocking metal rings.  It is always worn over a layer of padded fabric or soft leather to prevent chafing and lessen the impact of blows.  Extra protection is given by magical enchantments placed on this armor.

@6324 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

I have met with the Hidden in the sewers... a strange and mysterious creature that knew why I was there before I even said anything.  He directed me to kill two evil creatures that are hunting him.  I can locate them through a contact of theirs... the proprietor of an inn in the Docks District called the Sea's Bounty... he will know me as legitimate if I tell him that I am a 'Seeker'.  Once I have done the deed, I am to return to him and he will cure the girl.~
@6325 = ~This chase has gone on too long and I grow bored. The two have a contact in the proprietor of a dingy flop-house in the Docks District called the Sea's Bounty.~
@6326 = ~He will not believe that you have found me without the code words. Tell him that you are a seeker. He will tell you where the two lie, waiting for word of my whereabouts.~
@6327 = ~So you've found something, mate? These blokes'd be interested in it. Go to the Five Flagons tavern in the Bridge District, in a room on the second floor.~
@6328 = ~I should not have said anything. Please! You must go before I get myself into any more trouble.~
@6329 = ~Yes thank you! Jan, I have to go downstairs now. Perhaps you should wait up here.~
@6330 = ~The wizard is dead, and you are free... whoever you are.~
@6331 = ~I will find my own way and...(cough)... and damned if I won't live to see you die on this path you've chosen. Ah, I will waste no more breath on you!~

Keldorn has become anxious to return to his estate in Athkatla... apparently, he has not seen his family in over a season.  I have agreed to go with him.  His estate can be found in the Government District, and Keldorn will point it out when we pass.~
@6344 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn's wife has betrayed him by spending her time with another man... a crime that can only be answered by imprisonment.  Keldorn wishes to handle the grave task alone... he will return to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart building in three hours or so, and I can meet him there then.~
@6345 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn is full of grief at discovering that his wife has been spending time with another man.  He cannot talk to her... but he can join me in tracking down this Sir William of Thorpe and confronting him.  Keldorn said that Sir William frequents the Mithrest, an inn in Waukeen's Promenade.~
@6346 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to seek out Sir William on his own.  He said that if he is not at the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart within two day's time... then he is likely dead.  Either way, I should look for him there then.~
@6347 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has left the party to reconcile with his wife.  He said he would return to the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart after he was finished, perhaps after three days or so.  I will look for him there then.~
@6348 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Regardless of how I might feel about the matter, Keldorn has obviously decided to set affairs right with his wife... and not take retribution against Sir William.  I suppose he will want to return to his estate to speak with her soon.~
@6349 = ~Mazzy has challenged Gorf the Squisher.

Mazzy has apparently challenged an ogre pit fighter named Gorf to a duel... to be carried out at the Copper Coronet Inn.  We should head there as soon as possible.~
@6350 = ~Mazzy has challenged Gorf the Squisher.

I have acquired a potion from a fellow named Festule the Alchemist to help fight against the ogre.  I now have to somehow arrange to have Gorf drink the potion before the fight... Festule suggested that I speak to Bunkin, Gorf's main squeeze.~
@6351 = ~Despite the effectiveness of the enchantments on this shield, it is otherwise nondescript and defies precise identification.  Such standardization makes it likely that it is from the militia of some forgotten barony, though it is hard to be certain.

@6356 = ~Save Mazzy's sister, Pala

The Temple Superior at the Waukeenar temple agreed to search Barl's chambers, and returned to report that he had found alchemical equipment... as well as a holy symbol to Talona, the goddess of poisons.  Barl as much as admitted his guilt and attacked us.~
@6357 = ~Save Mazzy's sister, Pala

After confronting the evil cleric at the Waukeenar temple, Barl, antidote was found on his body... Pala has been cured, and Mazzy has asked for the evening to remain with her.  She says that she will be ready to leave by the next morning, if we are ready by then.~
@6358 = ~Save Mazzy's sister, Pala

After confronting the evil cleric at the Waukeenar temple, an antidote was found on his body... Pala has been cured, and Mazzy wishes to remain with her sister for an additional day.  I cannot afford to wait around, so Mazzy has told me she will remain in Trademeet until I need her again.~

@6361 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

Jan's uncle seems to think that we need the aid of something called 'the Hidden' to heal Lissa's daughter.  He directed me to the Lady Jysstev, who lives in an estate in the Government District, saying that she could lead me to it.  I should go and tell Jan of this news immediately.~
@6362 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The innkeep at the Sea's Bounty directed me to the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District... on the second floor, my two targets are in a room where they will wait to hear from me.~

@6417 = ~Hmph.  You're entitled to your opinion, my lady, but I think there is more that can be done to fight chaos than simply combating the most obvious evils with a sword.~
@6418 = ~You are a foreigner and a wanderer, true... but surely, my lady, you must think that evil can be fought with more than just a sword.~
@6419 = ~An idiot, am I?  If you've such a low opinion of me, than I shall simply remain silent... and watch you most carefully.~
@6420 = ~The Order has its place, Anomen... and government is not it.  Your vision is flawed, and you would do well to think most carefully before you do anything rash.~
@6421 = ~You are on the defensive and yet you taunt! Such gall!~
@6422 = ~The gall is yours to think I am on the defensive when I have led you as a mantis does her prey! You will fall here, and you death shall be... delicious!~
@6423 = ~If Lord Cor was not deep into his cups, he was demanding that I uphold the family honor... or telling me what a worthless son I had become.~
@6424 = ~He was derisive of my choice to join the Order.  He wanted me to take over his mercantile business... something I truly had no stomach for.~
@6425 = ~GgrrrrlglAAAAARRRRGHGHGHG!!~
@6426 = ~I would have given much for my father to be my mentor... but, instead, I endured his abuse until I was able to squire for the Order.  I fled as quickly as I was able to.~
@6427 = ~I... I suppose I am telling you this because you remind me a little of my sister, Moira.  She is young and determined... I miss her... perhaps the only thing of my family I miss.~
@6428 = ~I regret abandoning her to her fate, alone with Lord Cor... but there was... little I could do.  She... I am sure she...~
@6429 = ~No.  Never mind.  I do not wish to speak further about this, <CHARNAME>... excuse me.~
@6430 = ~Whining, is it?  I simply mean to talk and you wound me so casually?  Very well, then... I shall henceforth keep my thoughts to myself and away from your barbed tongue.~
@6431 = ~I think you might have at that.  I could not... I just never could stand up to him.  He raises his voice and suddenly I am a little boy hiding in the pantry once again.~
@6432 = ~I... I do wish to apologize for so abruptly ending our conversation yesterday.  I meant no offense by it.~ [ANOMEN70]
@6433 = ~Watch yourself, then, Anomen.~
@6434 = ~This is not a good time to speak of such things... let us just continue on.~
@6435 = ~I am glad to hear of it.  I... I think of my sister, sometimes, alone in the manor with my father.  From the last letter I received, it seemed as if she was bearing up well.~
@6436 = ~I wonder, sometimes, what has become of her... alone in that mansion with my father.  From the last letters I have received, she seems to be bearing up fairly well.~
@6437 = ~Yes... yes, of course, my lady.  It pains me that you are always so silent, but I will abide by your wishes.~
@6438 = ~I tire of your constant whining... let's just continue on.~
@6439 = ~If I am such a burden and a caustic presence to you, my lady, perhaps you would prefer it if I sought my adventures elsewhere.  I've no wish to disturb you... nor to be insulted.~
@6440 = ~I'm sorry, Anomen... I didn't mean to insult you.  Please forgive me.~
@6441 = ~We grew up together and I've tolerated her presence... beyond that, she's proven herself useful occasionally.~
@6442 = ~Ah.  If Moira were to be placed in the same situation as your Imoen, I... I am not sure what lengths I would go to free her.  I would give my own soul, if need be.~
@6443 = ~I'm sure you have your reasons for seeking Imoen's rescue... even if it is just to find this wizard.  I, myself, shall devote myself to seeking her freedom.~
@6444 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.~
@6445 = ~I remember when I first achieved the rank of squire.  It had been a difficult task... my father had refused to be my patron, so I was no better off than a commoner would be.~
@6446 = ~I was proud during the ceremony, and happy... but it was not to last.  My father, Lord Cor, stumbled into the Order's headquarters... he was filthy drunk and full of rage.~
@6447 = ~He began shouting at the knights... at Sir Ryan Trawl, no less... that I had been stolen from him. That I was a worthless and weak son who should not be in the Order.~
@6448 = ~Sir Ryan Trawl told him that I had proven myself... but the old bastard would hear none of it.  They were finally forced to drag him out of the headquarters, kicking and screaming.~
@6449 = ~No, I'm sorry, Anomen.  I meant nothing by it.  Please... tell me what you were thinking of, if you still wish to.~
@6450 = ~(sigh)  As... as you wish, my lady.  I was hoping to speak to another for a moment, but I've no desire to burden you.~
@6451 = ~You've left me little choice, my lady.  So be it... so long as you remain a force for righteousness, I shall remain by your side, silent.  For now.~
@6452 = ~Well... as you wish.  I have often been accused of a worrisome tongue and a quick temper, myself.  I accept your apology, my lady.~
@6453 = ~'Tis difficult, my lady.  Since the death of my mother, my father has been a cancer in my soul... a force against which I have struggled for years to prove myself.~
@6454 = ~As am I.  Since my mother's death, my father has been the force against which I have always struggled to prove myself... an invisible cancer which I cannot vanquish.~
@6455 = ~I... yes, I am finished my whining, my lady.  My... apologies... for burdening you with my dark thoughts.  I shall refrain in the future.~
@6456 = ~Don't be ridiculous, Anomen.  You've overcome many obstacles... you should be proud of your accomplishments.~
@6457 = ~Yes... I should harden myself.  I suppose you are correct.  Let us... continue on our journey, here, my lady.~
@6458 = ~My mother, however, was a follower of Helm and known to Sir Ryan Trawl.  She... petitioned the Knight-Commander on my behalf, begging him not to turn me away.~
@6459 = ~So Sir Ryan Trawl allowed me to enter as a novitiate to Helm.  I trained as a cleric and learned my sword arts from the guardians of the temple... and was able to eventually squire.~
@6460 = ~A long road it has been for me, <CHARNAME>... but I am pleased to serve in the Order under Helm's name.  And I trust that Helm is pleased with me, as well.~
@6461 = ~I am.  But that is not the way it has always been, my lady.  One does not show up young and penniless and begin a career to knighthood straight away... not within the Order.~
@6462 = ~What of you, then, <CHARNAME>?  You are a force for righteousness and honor... why do you not join the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart and achieve glory, as well?~
@6463 = ~What of you, then, <CHARNAME>?  You told me once that you were a force for righteousness... does that still hold true?  Do you still seek to defend the lands against evil?~
@6464 = ~I doubt they would have me, Anomen... besides that, I am hardly interested.~
@6465 = ~I'll do whatever I need to... I hold myself to no tenets, Anomen.~
@6466 = ~Bah!  I tire of all this talk... let us just continue your quest, here, in silence for a while.~
@6467 = ~My lady... I feel most terrible about my burst of temper the previous day.  Would... would you allow me the opportunity to apologize and try to explain?~ [ANOMEN73]
@6468 = ~Very well... I will listen to what you have to say.~
@6469 = ~I am most thankful, <CHARNAME>.  Sometimes, you see... my zeal for justice and valour can become too much.  There is an anger in my heart that I... cannot seem to control.~
@6470 = ~I see injustices everywhere, my lady, and... and I wish to do nothing but strike out against them.  But even when I do... I keep on striking out... the hate and anger only grows...~
@6471 = ~When I spoke to you of fighting against evil... I became angry, but it... it was more anger at my own inability to... to be as good and lawful as I might wish to be.~
@6472 = ~Everyone feels at least a little as you do, Anomen... I am sure even the most noble paladin feels anger and hate.~
@6473 = ~You are not unworthy... you just need to strive harder to achieve self-control, Anomen.~
@6474 = ~But I must.  An apology alone is not enough... this harsh zeal overtakes me at times.  There... there is an anger inside me that I cannot seem to control, <CHARNAME>...~
@6475 = ~Please, my lady... you must hear me through.  Allow me to explain my actions or you shall leave me to feel truly unworthy!~
@6476 = ~I... I see.  Please... accept my most humble apology, then, and we can... continue on, and I shall remain silent.~
@6477 = ~Again you remind me of my sister, Moira.  She, too, has a decent soul and a benevolent heart.  You should meet her sometime, <CHARNAME>... I truly think you would like each other.~
@6478 = ~I... do not think that is true.  The paladins in the Order speak only of contentment... and I have none of that.  But I thank you for your kind words, regardless.~
@6479 = ~I suppose you are correct, my lady.  I must... struggle... to continue my battle against evil.  And I must struggle to achieve this contentment that others speak of.~
@6480 = ~You... you wound me, my lady.  I had thought to find a sympathetic soul to confess my sin... you are far less like my dear Moira then I thought.~
@6481 = ~You are correct, of course.  I was a fool to let my anger overtake me... but I had hoped you might be able to discern my true intentions.  I shall leave you be, then, my lady.~
@6482 = ~Sorcerous Amin~
@6483 = ~I... I have done something most heinous.  This killing of Saerk and his... his daughter... I am not sure that I have done the right thing.~ [ANOMEN74]
@6484 = ~You... you suggested that I take this course of action, my lady.  I need your reassurance that there was nothing else that could be done... please.~
@6485 = ~You had to uphold your family's honor, Anomen... nothing is more important than that.~
@6486 = ~Yes... yes, you speak the truth, and I am glad to hear it.  That monster would never have paid as he should have for Moira's death!~
@6487 = ~But... still, my lady... it does not sit well with me that I gave into my great hate so easily.  Nor that I enjoyed it so much.  I thank you for speaking with me of it, though.~
@6488 = ~Yes, I suppose you are correct.  I know not how much honor my father has, but I have a duty to my family that I cannot ignore.  I... had to do it for Moira, if nothing else.~
@6489 = ~Yes, Saerk had to be destroyed.  I am... uncomfortable with the thought of having killed his daughter, but it was his actions that forced me to those extremes.~
@6490 = ~Too far?  I did only what I had to... and what you suggested!  If I... if I killed the girl, it was only because Saerk forced my hand.  It was his fault!~
@6491 = ~I... had a duty to protect my family... to avenge my sister's death.  Saerk... had to understand what he had done.  I... did my best, <CHARNAME>... and now you abandon me...~
@6492 = ~I no longer know what I should do.  I... shall have to think on this.  Let us... walk on, for now.~
@6493 = ~I shall try, my lady.  I had hoped to receive your good council again as I did to resolve my conflict, before.  Perhaps... perhaps another time.~
@6494 = ~My anger has built to the point when I am shaking with pure rage!  I... I must speak to you.  I must gain some reassurance!~ [ANOMEN75]
@6495 = ~My father... that rude, drunken bastard!  He has cast me out of the family when I was only doing what I must!  I cannot take vengeance when there is no proof, and he knows it!~
@6496 = ~And yet... my heart cries out for vengeance!  That my sister should lie murdered and the murderer laughs, untouched...!  I am so full of hate I can barely control it!~
@6497 = ~Please, my lady... you are the one I turned to for guidance when I was torn.  Did I do the right thing?  Should the dictates of honor truly overcome duty and justice?!~
@6498 = ~Of course, Anomen... how would you feel if you killed Saerk and found him to be innocent after the fact?~
@6499 = ~It is not your place to seek justice... that is the duty of the law.  You did all you could.~
@6500 = ~You must learn to control this anger, Anomen.  You knew this was the right path... and it is the way of the Order, as well.~
@6501 = ~Aye... aye, that would be a stain to my honor I surely could not bear.  But I still feel so helpless.  Surely... surely Saerk will pay, eventually for what he has done.~
@6502 = ~I feel a little better, now, my lady.  My thanks for your consolation.  Nothing, however, will take away this burning pain in my heart.  (sigh)  Let us just move on.~
@6503 = ~I know what you say is true, my lady.  But my sister lies cold and unavenged, and the murderer laughs free.  Surely the gods will... make him pay.  (sigh)  I know I cannot.~
@6504 = ~But you were the one who advised me!  How can I rest when I know that there was no other course than for me to avenge my sister!  The murderer is free, and my heart cries out for his blood!~
@6505 = ~I... I will have to think on this.  It was... the path of honor, and I should be content.  But... but...  (sigh)  No.  I will not speak to you of this.  Let us move on, now.~
@6506 = ~It is everything I have strived for... after years spent proving myself.  I... don't know what I would do if I failed the Test...~
@6507 = ~And, yet, suddenly I am quite sure that I will fail it.  It is my heart that will betray me.  I feel faithless and worthless in my soul... and they will know of it.~
@6508 = ~What do you think, my lady?  Am I really so terrible?  I have tried so hard, and yet it all seems to come to naught.  Do you... do you think I will fail the Test, as well?~
@6509 = ~You may... and you should be prepared for such an eventuality.~
@6510 = ~You must be confident that you follow the right path, Anomen.  If you follow your conscience, how can they refuse you?~
@6511 = ~You... you truly think so, my lady?  It is a pleasure to hear you say such, but I somehow doubt it will be so simple.  Even if you are just reassuring me, I do thank you for it.~
@6512 = ~Aaahh... the Test will come for me soon enough, I suppose.  And I doubt there is much more I can do between now and then to rectify my failings.  What will come will come.~
@6513 = ~Because I do not know my own conscience, my lady.  I would not turn to others for guidance if I did... but I do thank you humbly for your council.  You are most kind.~
@6514 = ~I suppose that is expected... You cannot counsel my heart, can you?  I simply wish that I knew what my own conscience dictated.  A worthy knight would know, yes?~
@6515 = ~You have made it plain for me, my lady.  As plain as your thinly-disguised contempt for my heart.  I will pass or fail the Test, I suppose... but it will be no thanks to you.~
@6516 = ~I have been told a few things of your travels in the north and in Baldur's Gate in particular.  Your adventures are... impressive, my lady.  The equal of any great heroine.~
@6517 = ~This man, Sarevok... I am told he was your brother.  Is this true?~
@6518 = ~Well... he was my half-brother, more or less.  We... had the same father.~
@6519 = ~He was my brother in that I am a child of the god, Bhaal, and so was he... if that's what you mean.~
@6520 = ~You... speak so carefully, my lady, because you have been accused of some manner of relation with the dead god of murder, yes?  He who was named Bhaal?~
@6521 = ~You need not deny it.  I was surprised, however, since you have maintained an honorable existence.  I... I cannot imagine what impulses your heritage must fill you with..~
@6522 = ~You need not deny it... I see evidence of this from some of your more base impulses.  I do not judge you, however.  I, myself, can lay claim to no pure heart.~
@6523 = ~This Sarevok was a man of great power and of similar godly heritage... and yet you maintained the higher road and saved the north from great chaos and destruction.~
@6524 = ~Yes, I know of this.  And I can see the signs.  I cannot imagine what it must be like... and I can claim no purity, myself, so I can only judge your actions.~
@6525 = ~I am not discussing Sarevok with you, Anomen... nor my activities in the Sword Coast.~
@6526 = ~Aye... and were that I could be so calm about my own.  I do wish you would trust me with more details, but I have no need to pry.  Forgive me, my lady.~
@6527 = ~Come... let us continue on your journey so that I may think.~
@6528 = ~But you have not always succeeded, yes?  I suppose calls of the blood do not need to rule one.  Your actions belie whatever motivations you might have... something to ponder.~
@6529 = ~My lady, I have been pondering your situation for some time... this matter of your peculiar heritage... and I find myself filled with admiration and wonder for you, truly.~ [ANOMEN78]
@6530 = ~The blood of the former god of murder flows through your veins... and yet you are an honorable woman.  You have done many great things and have earned respect.~
@6531 = ~My path is quite clear, Anomen.  There is no internal struggle... I am not controlled by my blood.~
@6532 = ~Just... just stand away from me, woman!  I stand on the precipice of a test that will decide whether my dream dies, and you are not helping!  Away from me, so that I might think!~
@6533 = ~Yes... always a struggle.  And, yet, you always manage to come out on top, do you not?~
@6534 = ~It must be so easy for you, my lady... you are a force for good and this blood seems to have no powerful influence over you.  'Always a struggle'?  Bah!~
@6535 = ~If I had such evil blood in me, I would be writhing on the ground!  I... I could not do what you do!  Why must I constantly endure this?!~
@6536 = ~I am full of an anger that I cannot quench, yet one that places my soul in peril... and this is something that I should get over?  You are a cruel woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@6537 = ~I thought we had become better confidantes than this.  I stand on the precipice of a test that will decide whether my dream dies, and you are hesitant to even help me?~
@6538 = ~My lady, I have been pondering your situation for some time... this matter of your peculiar heritage... and I find myself filled with questions that I am almost loathe to ask.~ [ANOMEN79]
@6539 = ~War Hammer +2, +1 electrical: 'Borok's Fist'
Borok Thundercracker was a dwarven hero that led several campaigns against giants and other "tall vermin" that had plagued his people in a number of their communities.  This hammer was his blessed weapon, which his elven allies called his "little iron fist", though not to his face.

@6540 = ~Is there a struggle inside you, my lady?  Do you have your rage bottled up inside you, as I do?  Is there... is there a fight against evil in your heart?~
@6541 = ~My wife and I... were always close, but lately my business has taken much of my time. It has been difficult, and I knew she was unhappy but... I...~
@6542 = ~I... I am truly sorry, my lady.  I asked a question of you, and my response to your answer was nothing short of reprehensible.  Please... please forgive me.~ [ANOMEN80]
@6543 = ~Of course... it is no trouble.~
@6544 = ~Forget it, Anomen.  I've received enough abuse from you... and more than enough apologies.~
@6545 = ~Fine, fine... but let's get moving.  We haven't time for chit-chat right now.~
@6546 = ~The answer is obvious. Your honor has been maligned. Kill them both for their trespass!~
@6547 = ~She will realize where she belongs, I am sure. Do not make a crisis of this.~
@6548 = ~Joining the Order is important to you, Anomen... you should remain vigilant and steel yourself.~
@6549 = ~I had simply thought that you were a kindred sort, <CHARNAME>.  I see a similar struggle in you... and thought that, as a friend, you might understand me a little.~
@6550 = ~Fine, fine.  Let's just continue on... we've no time for this chit-chat.~
@6551 = ~Y-yes... thank you for your understanding, I suppose.  I simply wish we had more time to speak.  More important matters press, however... let us continue your journey.~
@6552 = ~I appreciate your assistance, but it is most confusing.  I shall... try to remain vigilant, as you suggest, but I think I will need to work it out for myself.~
@6553 = ~I am not to worry over joining the Order?  Fine advice, now that I sit and regret not paying my duty to my family.  Saerk sits alive... on your advice, I might add.~
@6554 = ~I appreciate your assistance, <CHARNAME>, but it is most confusing.  Perhaps the Order is not worth such agony... it is something I must devote some thought to on my own.~
@6555 = ~Aye.  Your advice has always been constant, pointing me back towards the good.  Saerk is alive, which is sad but is the lawful course.  And... and the Order is my dream.~
@6556 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>... your kind words gladden me more than I can say.  Your advice means much... you are a... a dark flame, my lady, that I am drawn to almost against my will.~
@6557 = ~But 'tis a most pleasurable experience.  You have been kind despite my own boorishness.  Perhaps one day... we will speak of other things.  I... I think I would like that.~
@6558 = ~Mmm.  Your view of the Order's tenets are obvious.  You advised me to do my duty by my family... and justice was brought to Saerk and his family, as it should have been.~
@6559 = ~Perhaps the Order is not all I have always thought it to be.  Perhaps you are right to advise me to worry less... no doubt I would be happier.~
@6560 = ~It seems that you know little of me, after all.  I had thought you a kindred spirit.  Perhaps... perhaps I was wrong.  (sigh)  Let us just... continue and I shall handle my problems myself.~
@6561 = ~Aye, which is no less than I expected.  Always I must struggle on my own.  You are wise, my lady... as always.  I had simply hoped for... for more.~
@6562 = ~Let us just... move on, then, and continue your quest.  It will not be long now, anyway, before my Test comes and my questions will be answered for myself.~
@6563 = ~I am glad to hear that, my lady. I see within you one who goes through a similar struggle as I do... although you do not complain about it half as much as I.~
@6564 = ~Freedom (Abjuration) 
Level: 9
Range:  Special 
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special 
Saving Throw: None 

NOTE:  Cast this spell in an area where you know someone is imprisoned and they will be released.
This is the reverse of the spell Imprisonment.  When a creature is imprisoned, he is trapped in a sphere far beneath the surface of the earth.  If this spell is cast in the area where he was imprisoned, it will instantly free him and he will reappear exactly where he was standing when he was imprisoned.  This spell will also cancel the effects of the spell Maze and return any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes.~
@6565 = ~My Test is coming very soon, my lady.  I will need to go to the headquarters of the Order and speak to Ryan Trawl.  I... I am not looking forward to the judgement I shall receive there.~
@6566 = ~They are fair, my lady.  I am not unsettled by the chance they will make the wrong decision... I am unsettled by the chance that they will make the right one.~
@6567 = ~I... have been thinking on what we have spoken of.  I have studied to join the Order as long as I can remember, and suddenly I am unsure if I should even want to.~
@6568 = ~I have done as you said, and my wife and I are together once more. She was shamed by her breach of our vows, so we are united in our duty to the sanctity of our commitment again.~
@6569 = ~What if I am accepted into the Order and I find I have no true place in it?  And what if I am refused... and I discover the future has no place for me?~
@6570 = ~There is not the spark we once had, but this is a more realistic pairing now. We have put out the fires of our youth. Thank you again.~
@6571 = ~I know, deep down inside, that I have maintained good faith.  But... perhaps I am wrong.  Perhaps I will only discover too late where my heart truly lies.~
@6572 = ~I... I have done nothing and... and the situation with my wife is unchanged. She grows ever distant. I... thought you should know.~
@6573 = ~I'm sure it won't be that bad... everything will work out as it should.~
@6574 = ~None of us do, of course! These worms are barely worthy of stepping upon the floor of the house of the Storm Lord! Nevertheless, you will hear them!~
@6575 = ~You will not think so after a few whining fools try to beg for gold or some other paltry service.~
@6576 = ~You jest with me, my lady.  I think you would do far better in my position.  You are a strong woman.  I, on the other hand, am too susceptible to my own desires.~
@6577 = ~I have been thinking about Sir Cadril and the Order, and I have decided I am well rid of them!  I cannot believe I wasted so much of my life on such ignorant fools!~ [ANOMEN82]
@6578 = ~That's good to see... you could use a little freedom, I think.~
@6579 = ~Greater Restoration (Necromancy) 
Level: 7
Sphere:  Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised.  This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster.  A restoration spell will also restore the intelligence of a creature affected by a feeblemind spell.  It also negates any form of insanity such as confusion or berserk, fully heals the target, and cures any disease or poisons.  The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest and she will likely require rest immediately afterwards, as it will cause days' worth of fatigue almost instantaneously.~
@6580 = ~No, I really don't think you understand. My name is Inspector Ardis, and I work for the city guard. Vilon and I have had an... understanding in the past.~
@6581 = ~Aye, I could at that!  Too long has this poor knight frowned and growled... I've enough of it, to tell the truth.  I long to laugh and do as I like... and, by Helm, I shall!~
@6582 = ~Well... perhaps a little.  I have been part of the Order too long to shrug it off.  But I know what is better for my heart.  I feel lighter than I have since... since ever, I suppose.~
@6583 = ~But I won't keep a beautiful woman waiting for me to quit my childish gazing about.  I've no need to linger and look at pretty things so long as I am traveling with you, my lady.~
@6584 = ~I've come to this point partly from your own advice, <CHARNAME>.  You do not like it?  Fair enough... I do, and 'tis more than enough for me.~
@6585 = ~Well said and much appreciated by this formerly dour knight, my lady!  'Tis a grand thing to be complimented by a beautiful lady, especially one with your grace.~
@6586 = ~There's much I'd like to see and do... but for now, it will suffice to keep the company of such a grand woman as yourself.  Come, let us complete your quest post-haste.~
@6587 = ~My lady... I have been watching you most intently these past few hours and I have come to a conclusion about you.  Would you like to hear my thoughts?~ [ANOMEN83]
@6588 = ~I refrained from telling you how I felt, of course... it is not proper for a knight of the Order to be so unbecoming.  But I am under no such restrictions, now.~
@6589 = ~You are a beautiful woman, <CHARNAME>... full of a life that I have always desired.  I wish to experience new things, now that I am free... and I wish to be closer to you.~
@6590 = ~A kiss?  I... I suppose so...~
@6591 = ~Yes, that was a desirable choice. Their petty problems are hardly worth the ear of the church. Still, I'm sure there could have been greater destruction in the result. Keep this in mind in future.~
@6592 = ~Ha HA! Marvelous! Death, destruction of vows, and coin for the church coffers on top! A fine coup against the forces of order. You will make a fine Stormlord. Here is your share of the reward.~
@6593 = ~I advised a merchant to forgive his wife her transgressions. They are happy now.~
@6594 = ~Then close your eyes, and I shall do the same... we shall meet for a moment as if we were two innocents coming together in the dark.  A single brush of our lips, a kiss...~
@6595 = ~... and there... I shall savor this, my dear, this most sweet favor of yours.  I know many pretty lines of poetry from my teachings, but I have never known the favor of a woman.~
@6596 = ~Of all the things I might wish to experience, this is the one I most longed for.  A promise for what is to come.  Let us... continue on, now, lest the others begin to stare.~
@6597 = ~You could turn the world aside with your power and skill as easily as you brush aside my advances... I follow you willingly and with vigor, and I shall continue to do so.~
@6598 = ~You've refused me, of course... no less than I expected.  I am a poor excuse for a courtier and a poorer excuse for a lover, but I shall not give up so easily, my lady.~
@6599 = ~You may have captured me, but I am not so helpless... one day, I shall capture you, too.  Either that or I am the simple fool that I appear to be, hm?  We shall see.~
@6600 = ~Now... let us catch up with our companions before their stares grow more curious.~
@6601 = ~Nowhere did Talos mention this 'They are Happy Now!!' No, I really do not think you understand the edicts of the Talassan faith!~
@6602 = ~As you wish... but no funny business.~
@6603 = ~I am tired, Anomen... I wish only to sleep.~
@6604 = ~Come aside, then, and let us talk in earnest.  I... I spoke to you earlier of my feelings for you, <CHARNAME>.  If you thought that I was being facetious, then I apologize.~
@6605 = ~Still, I would have you remember that you are a servant of Talos, and his will must be demonstrated in yours. Do try harder.~
@6606 = ~Nothing would make me happier than to please you... and to lay with you tonight.  I have dreamt about this moment, my lady, and I believe the moment is right.~
@6607 = ~Here... in this place.  Let me remove my tunic and you may gaze upon my body, honed through years of exertion... and you may decide for yourself if I am worthy of you.~
@6608 = ~Come with me, then, for I consider nothing I have to say or offer to be funny.  If you consider me flippant, then I apologize... my yearning for you is both true and honest.~
@6609 = ~I had arranged for Inspector Ardis to meet with you. He has in the past been most cooperative, especially in dealing with those that confess to certain acts.~
@6610 = ~Please reconsider, <CHARNAME>.  I cannot stand alone a moment longer, looking upon you without touching... come aside with me and let me speak plainly of these things.~
@6611 = ~Fine... but no funny business.~
@6612 = ~Forget it... I said I wasn't interested and I meant it.~
@6613 = ~I do not wish to be alone, my lady... I wish to be with you!  For ones such as we, the time for solitude and love comes so seldom... do not turn me aside, <CHARNAME>, I beg of you.~
@6614 = ~Very well... I will go with you.~
@6615 = ~No, Anomen... and I mean it.~
@6616 = ~This is talk, my lady... this is me telling you both of my desire and my love for you... I want to enfold you with my strength and feel yours.  I want to listen to your heartbeat and feel it.~
@6617 = ~This is talk, my lady... this is me telling you of my desire and my love.  I want to listen to your heartbeat and I want you to feel mine.~
@6618 = ~I want to experience passion, <CHARNAME>, and I want to experience it with you.  Please do not deny me this... I do not think I could stand it.~
@6619 = ~Very well, then, Anomen... you've won me over.~
@6620 = ~I shall find another, <CHARNAME>.  One day, perhaps... and I hope she will be as beautiful and alluring as you.~
@6621 = ~Hmmm.  I have been thinking.  I am still a bit bitter at being rejected by the Order, but... in many ways, I have never felt so... happy.  Is that not odd?~ [ANOMEN85]
@6622 = ~But it is not just that.  Not a month ago, I never would have foreseen this.  Rejected by the Order, I would have thought my life over.  But the freedom... it is most intoxicating.~
@6623 = ~I killed a man. It wasn't... it wasn't self-defense. Others have said it was, but I know better. He... he did issue a challenge, and we did fight, but he said such things...~
@6624 = ~I need no longer restrict myself to dusty codes of conduct and goodness.  No more worrying about honor... I may do as I please and live life as I wish.  And I have found you.~
@6625 = ~And I know that I have not done anything untoward.  Helm has not been offended... he accepts my worship, still.  The Order has turned me aside, but my God knows better.~
@6626 = ~Things have gone well, I think.  Helm has worked a mysterious trick on my destiny.  We are meant to be together, you and I... I am interested to see what will come of it.~
@6627 = ~I agree... we are meant to be together.~
@6628 = ~I do not think you should talk so flippantly of what Helm is thinking... overconfidence can be dangerous.~
@6629 = ~Don't go making plans... you may not be around to see them through.~
@6630 = ~Simple. Kill all the witnesses. It was an innocent duel if no one is left to say different.~
@6631 = ~Hmm.  Do you suspect me of still being bitter against the Order, then, my lady?  Perhaps a little, I am... but moreover I am glad to be rid of the yoke of that sad group of men.~
@6632 = ~Well, I'm pleased to hear you say that, my lady.  I've become quite used to your company over our time together... and I have no wish to see us part ways.~
@6633 = ~I think I know what Helm approves or disapproves of better than some, my lady.  He has not abandoned me... at least not yet.~
@6634 = ~Deny it if you wish, my lady, 'tis destiny and there is no denying it.  But... you are likely correct.  Fate likely has a few surprises in store for us, yet.~
@6635 = ~Aye.  Death may come at any time for either of us, 'tis true.  No one may know what fate has up its sleeve... but I'll make a wager on it, regardless, my lady.~
@6636 = ~We are to rest, now, are we?  That is good.  Come, my lady... I wish to speak with you for a moment away from the ears of others.~ [ANOMEN86]
@6637 = ~I... have something I must say to you, <CHARNAME>.  I do not wish you to think me flippant or lacking in sincerity... I mean this most honestly, what I will say.~
@6638 = ~My... my life is full of chaos, now, and I wish for there to be one thing that is permanent.  So I offer my heart to you, along with my service and my companionship.~
@6639 = ~Mounted knights cannot effectively use pole arms while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been altered so they may be used one-handed.  The horseman's war hammer is made entirely of steel, and has a shaft about 18 inches long.  Powerful magical energy flows through this weapon, though its origins are nondescript.

@6640 = ~No, Anomen... I do not love you.~
@6641 = ~Most wondrous occasion!  I will shout my love to the heavens themselves!  I shall be your faithful servant and your lover... let nothing else come between us.~
@6642 = ~I... I hope that means that I have some measure of affection from you, as well.  If that is so, then I agree to your acceptance.  I shall be your faithful servant for as long as fate allows.~
@6643 = ~Yes.  Yes, you tell the truth of it.  It matters not, my love... I shall remain at your side until this quest of yours is completed.  And... perhaps then your mind will have changed its course.~
@6644 = ~Ahhhh... the truth burns my soul, to hear such words from your lips!~
@6645 = ~But... better to have it said, now, than to suffer at length.  Turned away from the Order and my love, both...'tis my fate, it seems.~
@6646 = ~I shall say it only one more time, then... I love you, <CHARNAME>.  I love you faithfully and truly, and that shall never end.  And... and I shall bother you no more.~
@6647 = ~I am out of my mind, yes.  Out of my mind with love and adoration.  And, yet, to be scorned so by you... it burns my soul to hear such.~
@6648 = ~I... I thought that there was more between us.  Or perhaps you mean to drive me away, I am unsure.  If so... you are successful in your plan.~
@6649 = ~I... I cannot stay, for I love you still and cannot remain in your sight knowing that you scorn me so.  Farewell, then, my love... you will see me not again.~
@6650 = ~A glorious day it is, my lady!  I have achieved my dream, and I owe much of that to your assistance and counsel.  I... I am most grateful to you for it.~ [ANOMEN87]
@6651 = ~Thank you... I was happy to help.~
@6652 = ~Good for you... now we need to get moving.~
@6653 = ~And help you did.  Meeting your group of fellows has affected me in the most fortunate way.  To think I had such grave doubts... that seems like another time for me, now.~
@6654 = ~I spoke to Sir Ryan Trawl before I left the headquarters... he wishes me to lead an expedition to the far south.  I will have my own soldiers under my command, <CHARNAME>!~
@6655 = ~Sir Ryan Trawl also mentioned that my duties with the Order could be put aside for the moment so that I might continue my travels with you.~
@6656 = ~Short Sword +2
The term "short sword" does not exist in sword classifications, but has come describe the earliest type of sword, a double-edged blade about two feet in length.  There are etched runes on the surface of this weapon that glow during combat, indicating it has undergone some form of enchantment, but no identifying marks can be recognized.

@6658 = ~You see this flower I have picked, here?  'Tis a rare find... a crimson rhodelia, if I am not mistaken.~ [ANOMEN88]
@6659 = ~I... I warned you not to open the sarcophagus!  Run, my friends, run!!~ [SASSAR07]
@6660 = ~I have said many times how grateful I am, but I have never told you that I was attracted to you from the start... your heart and your bright soul, not to mention your beauty.~
@6661 = ~Do... do my words offend you, my lady?  Have I overstepped myself?~
@6662 = ~And rightly you should be.  It is but a pale comparison to your true beauty, and possesses not a tenth of your merits... but it is the closest to you that I have found.~
@6663 = ~I... I was not trying to be an idiot, as you say, my lady.  I was seeking to speak pretty words to you, as pretty words I know well.~
@6664 = ~But if I am... if I am being foolish, then I shall desist.  Please forgive me for overstepping my bounds, my lady.  I... I meant no harm.~
@6665 = ~Come, then, good lady.  Let us continue on your quest... we can talk more at a later time and I shall be free to complement you at your leisure.~
@6666 = ~Do not tease me, though... I mean well and am honest when I speak of you, my lady.  But I shall push no more... let us continue our travels... we can speak more later of it.~
@6667 = ~I... I see.  It was not my intent to offend you, my lady.  I shall bother you no more with my sorry courting, then.  Please... please forgive me.~
@6668 = ~I'll go with you, Anomen... so long as there's no funny business.~
@6669 = ~Forget it, Anomen... I just want to sleep.~
@6670 = ~You pound the stake through the vampire's foul heart. The creature shall prey no more on the blood of others.~
@6671 = ~You have become the captain of my soul, and have kept me on the path of righteousness and good... and aided me in achieving a dream I had nearly thought to be impossible.~
@6672 = ~I... I wish to become closer to you, <CHARNAME>.  I wish to feel you in my arms, to caress your skin and lay with you in the night.~
@6673 = ~Am I being too forward with you, my lady?  Would you find a poor knight such as I an acceptable lover?  I... would not be offended if you did not, I yearn only to be with you.~
@6674 = ~You are not being too forward, Anomen... I wish to be with you, as well.~
@6675 = ~Forget it, Anomen... I've no interest in this.~
@6676 = ~The stench of death assaults your nostrils as the lid slides back. A feeling of raw evil power emanates from four golden limbs of bones that lie within: two complete arms and two complete legs of a golden skeleton. Magical energy swirls in the air around you and a creature appears.~
@6677 = ~There is time enough for sleep, is there not?  We have little enough time in our dangerous lives to steal a moment for ourselves... can I not persuade you to consider what I say?~
@6678 = ~No, Anomen... I said no and I meant it.~
@6679 = ~I am glad to hear it, my love.  Come to me, then... I shall remove my too-worn armor and we can lay together for the eve... and I shall show you the love that I hold for you...~
@6680 = ~I would yearn to hear words of reciprocation... but I shall accept your agreement, for now.  I hope, in time, you will feel the same passion for me that I do for you.~
@6681 = ~For now, however, I shall be content to show you passion... let me remove my worn armor and we may lay together, and I will be content for a time, with you...~
@6682 = ~I want to show you the depth of the passion I feel for you, my lady.  If you... if you truly do not wish it, however, I will understand.~
@6683 = ~Very well, Anomen... show me your passion, if you wish.~
@6684 = ~Don't be a fool, Anomen.  I said no, and I meant it... and I resent having to tell you twice!~
@6685 = ~As you wish, my lady. Perhaps the time is not right or... perhaps you do not feel the same as I.  I wish no answer, just yet.  I am content to remain at your side, a follower and companion.~
@6686 = ~I... I meant no offense.  I only wished to express myself, and I seem to have done a poor job of it.  I shall bother you no further, then, with my clumsy and inexperienced efforts.~
@6687 = ~I have been thinking of many things, now, as we travel.  I must admit that I never have felt happier and more content... and yet a week ago I would not have thought this even possible.~ [ANOMEN90]
@6688 = ~Good for you... now let's keep moving.~
@6689 = ~I have also been thinking of Saerk... and I am glad that you pushed me to refrain from taking vengeance on the man.  There was no real evidence of his involvement, was there?~
@6690 = ~It would have been wrong of me to listen to my father's ravings.  Moira... she would not have wanted me to take bloody vengeance for her, not if it wasn't true.~
@6691 = ~And, if... if Saerk did those things... well.  Well, he will pay for them.  Someday... I suppose.  The gods will see to that.~
@6692 = ~Aye, perhaps now is not the best time to talk.  I only wished to thank you, my lady... for pushing me towards keeping the righteous path during that business.~
@6693 = ~It... it would not have been right for me to take vengeance.  And I achieved my dream in the Order, after all that.  Father... will just have to be satisfied with things as they are... yes.~
@6694 = ~Ah, but yet I ramble on, don't I?  Come, impatient woman... let us keep moving, then.~
@6695 = ~I hope that he will find it in himself to forget about Saerk and rebuild what he has lost.  Perhaps he can find a new wife... lose the hatred that festers in his heart as I have.~
@6696 = ~Ahhhh, it is a simple hope, is all.  But not likely.  Perhaps father will speak to me again when I next return to him.  Moira... Moira would want me to, I think.~
@6697 = ~(sigh)  But the thought saddens me, now, when I wanted to think of glad things.  Such as you.  Come, my love... let us move on, now.~
@6698 = ~I just came back to thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You have saved my honor and my soul. I have made partial restitution to the family of the man I dueled, and they have forgiven me.~
@6699 = ~I have returned to evaluate your performance with those that seek the advice of our lord Talos. What have you to tell me about Ti'Vael the dwarf? How did his problem work out?~
@6700 = ~Be quick about it. I have to report on your value as a 'servant' of the people.~
@6701 = ~Well done! Death and destruction all around, a man's life ruined, and profit for the church as well. That he lives to suffer is even more fitting.~
@6702 = ~Excellent! Destruction, death, and the damning of a soul to torment. Talos surely approves.~
@6703 = ~I advised him to forgive his wife her transgressions. They are happy now.~
@6704 = ~I have returned to evaluate your performance of your duty to Helm. What have you to tell me about Ti'Vael the dwarf? How did you advise him to deal with his problem?~
@6705 = ~Katana
The katana is a single-edged, slightly curved sword that ends with a chisel point. The katana is perhaps one of the finest swords ever made, the steps to its creation a long and secret process, that is more art form than anything else.  This blade is an important facet of Kara-Tur culture.  To touch or wield a samurai's katana is to insult the samurai and to incite his wrath.  For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@6706 = ~This is not the way of Helm! There were innocent souls requiring help, and you led them down the path of chaos! You have failed in your duty! This is inexcusable!~
@6707 = ~You have misrepresented the Watcher and made a mockery of your role as a protector! I have no choice but to recommend you be stripped of the honor of specialty priest!~
@6708 = ~By the Morninglord! In whose estimation did you think this best?! I cannot imagine a greater lapse in judgement! You are not fit to guide people in the ways of Lathander!~
@6709 = ~You make me sick! Many witnessed your little display with that dwarven fool! This is not the way of Talos! Where is the destruction? Where is the mayhem?~
@6710 = ~You may think you have nothing to report to me about your advice to the dwarf Ti'Vael, but I know better. A friend in the guard has informed me that he is dead.~
@6711 = ~So your benign advice put him off his guard and got him killed. I question the method, but the results please the church. In future, try to expand upon the chaos caused.~
@6712 = ~You have done exceptionally well. By taking responsibility he has spared his soul a most dreadful anguish. This adherence to a higher law is very agreeable to Helm's teachings.~
@6713 = ~A friend in the city guard has informed me about a sad occurrence. The dwarf you were to have given guidance has turned up dead. It would seem that he thought his crime would go unpunished.~
@6714 = ~I have been speaking with some followers that belong to the guard, and they tell me that the dwarf Ti'Vael turned himself in on your advice.~
@6715 = ~While the law is served in this case, I cannot help but wonder if the actual victims could not have been better provided for. Still, Ti'Vael will pay what penalty he thinks he must.~
@6716 = ~When I first met you, my lady... there are many things that went through my head.  The possibility that you were not what you seemed, for instance.~
@6717 = ~But what was most striking was the immediacy with which you afflicted my heart.  I ignored it, denied it... until recently.  And now it consumes my every waking moment.~
@6718 = ~There is so much chaos in your... in our... life, I find myself yearning for something that is permanent.  I... would not ask you to promise anything you could not give, my lady.~
@6719 = ~There is death waiting around every corner for us, I know.  All I ask, then, is that you accept me as your servant... that, in the days to come, we shall struggle to remain together...~
@6720 = ~That we shall not abandon each other.  If I continue to remain with you, my love... I could not bear our parting.  If... you cannot see that for us... please... tell me now...~
@6721 = ~Really, <CHARNAME>, the advice you gave him could have been a little more proactive, and could have avoided this. If he had taken responsibility... well, what is done is done.~
@6722 = ~I love you, too, Anomen... and I do not want us to part, either.~
@6723 = ~I do not know what the future will bring, Anomen... but I do not want you to leave me.~
@6724 = ~That you say this... pleases me more than I can express.  Suddenly I have the desire to shout my love to the heavens, themselves.  But I shall refrain... for now, at least.~
@6725 = ~Let us return to the others, then, and spend the night together... and when we awake we shall continue on your quest.~
@6726 = ~I had hoped that your affection would rival mine, but it would be too much.  I am glad to remain... and I will bear up under the possibility that you may grow to love me, yet.~
@6727 = ~I will prove myself worthy to you, my love.  Let us... let us return to the others so that we may continue on your quest tomorrow.~
@6728 = ~Aye, you speak the truth of it.  This knight shall remain at your side, regardless, because he loves you yet... I shall protect you regardless of your desire.~
@6729 = ~But you are a merciful lady, 'tis true.  Better to tell me now and be quick with it.  I shall tell you only once more then, and I shall be silent afterwards... I love you.~
@6730 = ~And now I shall bother you no more.  Let us... let us return to the others so that we might get our rest.~
@6731 = ~I... I am out of my mind.  I am out of my mind with love and with passion.  You occupy it completely, and to hear you scorn me so hurts... hurts me more than I can bear.~
@6732 = ~That you have led me this far saddens me... I trusted you, my lady.  I trusted you and I gave you my heart, and you have abused it.  Was I... was I so unworthy?~
@6733 = ~But you have spoken your will and I shall not disregard it.  But... nor can I stay.  I shall say this only once more, then, and then I shall be on my way... I love you.~

@6740 = ~My... my father writes, here: "... the authorities have found Moira's murderers... a pair of disgruntled workers who were once under my employ..."~
@6741 = ~"... not finding anything of worth, they demanded valuables from your sister and killed her when she could produce nothing.  The men have been caught and confessed all..."~
@6742 = ~"... I hear that you have failed the Order, so this should come as no burden to you.  Your assistance with Saerk has restored my business, regardless, so I suppose I should thank you..."~
@6743 = ~"... but, my fortunes restored, I cannot afford to have a scandalous son hanging about.  A murderer and a failure... so I have declared that you are no longer my son..."~
@6744 = ~"... it is not that I am ungrateful, but it just will not do to have myself associated with such a pathetic personage.  Bad for business, you see.  Regards... Lord Cor Delryn..."~
@6745 = ~I... I lost everything I worked towards to perform my duty for my family... at his insistence... and he disowns me!  He disowns me!!~
@6746 = ~You... feel awful...~
@6747 = ~Not... not worth my anger...~
@6748 = ~... vengeance...~
@6749 = ~NO!!  I am not about to listen to you!  Ahhh, foulsome wench!  I... I have murdered an innocent man and his daughter!!  I lost the Order!!  And ALL OF IT AT YOUR URGING!!~
@6750 = ~You are the one that has pushed me down this path!  I... I cannot believe I have done all of this!!  For you!!  For my father!!~

@6752 = ~... my father and I have a reckoning that will not be stopped.  Him I do not forgive, nor will I ever.  I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I must go to Athkatla, now...~
@6753 = ~... I must go and atone for what I have done.  And my father will atone with me.  Fare... fare you well...~
@6754 = ~Aye, but it is happening anyway.  As it must, for I have lost everything.  You... you I forgive, for you meant well.  But my father...~
@6755 = ~Aye... aye, you are right in that.  You meant well, and are not responsible for my heart.  I cannot blame you, my love.  But... my father...~
@6756 = ~Aye... you do not deserve my anger.  What you did... you meant well by me, at least.  I cannot blame you, my love.  But... my father...~
@6757 = ~This is the end, Father.  Your thoughtless cruelty destroyed Mother... it destroyed Moira... and it destroyed me.  I shall atone for my evil acts, and so shall you!~ [ANOMEN93]
@6758 = ~I am no priest, my former son... you'll not see me bowing before any altars!  Best be on your way before I get angry!~ [COR09]
@6759 = ~You'll atone, father, whether you like it or not.  I shall kill you... we shall die together and end this madness as it should be ended!~
@6760 = ~You... you would kill me?!  Bah!  You're too weak to go through with such an act!~
@6761 = ~It is no act.  Prepare yourself, father, for I... what?!  <CHARNAME>?  What are you doing here?!~
@6762 = ~This will take you further down the path toward evil, Anomen... do not do it.~
@6763 = ~It's time for all this hate to end, Anomen... and you have to be the one to stop it!~
@6764 = ~I intend to do this myself.  I do not want you to dirty your hands, my love... but I will not stop whatever you intend.  As I said before, then, father... prepare yourself!~
@6765 = ~Very well, then.  I... I had no wish for you to see this, but it matters not.  I am atoning for what I have done... and father... as I said before... prepare yourself!~
@6766 = ~Aye... aye, you speak the right of it.  Father is not responsible solely for what I have done... it has always been I...~
@6767 = ~There is an evil in my heart, I have always known this and I spoke of it to you.  Hate and anger, twisted and black... and I... I cannot control it.  But... nor can I live with it...~
@6768 = ~Because you will be stronger, then... because we will be together.~
@6769 = ~Aye.  Aye, you speak the right of it.  I do not wish to go down this path, no matter what my father has done to me.  But... I may have no choice, my love.~
@6770 = ~I... I cannot, my love.  My heart overflows with rage, and it always has.  I cannot live with this... and there is only one way to quench it, one way to atone.  I am sorry...~
@6771 = ~Aye... I love you, too.  But it is already done.  There is a hate in my heart, and only one way to quench it, to atone for what I have done.  I... I am sorry, my love...~
@6772 = ~Then... then that is enough for me.  I will live on the hope that your love... will one day quench my hate.  I thank you, <CHARNAME>, for... for stopping me.~
@6773 = ~Bah!  I always knew you were too much of a pansy to go through with it!  I was right to disown you as I did... weak and pathetic, you are, since a boy, even!~
@6774 = ~I could have been more, father, had you cared.  I... I always loved you.  And I still do.~
@6775 = ~Aye.  And still I do.  We are so much alike, you and I.  More than you will ever know.  We... could have been so much more.~
@6776 = ~Go, then.  Go and tend to your petty schemes, I'll have no more of it.  Perhaps one day, if you find some shred of enlightenment... perhaps, then, we'll speak again.~
@6777 = ~... Aye... perhaps...~
@6778 = ~I am sorry, my love, for all of this disturbance.  You have a quest to attend to... and I intend to be there to assist you.  Now... and forever more...~
@6779 = ~<CHARNAME>,

Goodbye. No sappy farewells or crying over how things must be; I do neither of these things well, nor would I wish to. I have made a decision; one that is not ideal, but it is necessary. I can go nowhere without this shadow, and I wish to leave it behind. I am returning to the Harper Hold that I might face judgement there. I will plead the case as we saw it for whatever they accuse, and if they do not see reason then I will suffer what I must. Galvarey had detractors as well as allies, so I believe I can end this in my favor. If not, at least it will be an end.
 
I do not ask you to follow. I do this for myself, and there will be little or no gain for you. You may still be a target of violence, but perhaps their interest in you will wither beside the capture of a 'traitor.' 

For better or worse, I am taking control once more. I hope to see you again in better times. 

With Nature's love and mine,
Jaheira~
@6780 = ~Together.  Together, yes... but do you love me, <CHARNAME>?  Am I only your companion, or will I have your strength to draw on?~
@6781 = ~No... I do not love you in that way.~
@6782 = ~Then what is done is done.  I have always loved you, <CHARNAME>, but it ends here.  I... I am sorry...~
@6783 = ~Well, I'm not accustomed to getting such presents like this. I will have it looked into, and should a reward be appropriate, I will have it delivered to the temple.~
@6784 = ~<CHARNAME>.  I... I do love you, as I have said so many times.  It is true.  But... it is not enough.  Not enough to assuage my dark soul.~
@6785 = ~I cannot stay here, after what I have done.  And I cannot stay with you. 
I... must go elsewhere.  I am sorry... truly sorry.~
@6786 = ~There... the fool is dead, and good riddance.  I always knew he was weak, and now I've proved it.~
@6787 = ~You, there... you are the harlot that Anomen adventured with, I see.  What are your intentions, then?~
@6788 = ~I will leave you, Lord Cor... but I want you to know that you destroyed a good man.  I hope you can live with that.~
@6789 = ~If I must. Speak, and spare no tawdry detail of your confession.~
@6790 = ~I have been slaving away here for some years, and I find it a great insult that you have been promoted above me. It is inexcusable, and also quite perplexing.~
@6791 = ~I demand satisfaction, and I demand it now. You have made offense, albeit indirectly, and now you will duel me, and you will die.~
@6792 = ~Wakizashi
The wakizashi, or companion sword is extremely important to samurai.  It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night.  As finely made as the katana, the wakizashi, a shorter sword with a length between 12 and 24 inches, is a dangerous weapon in the hands of a skilled user.

@6797 = ~I see. This follower didn't happen to wrong you in some way, did he? Have you been 'encouraged' to report him? Should I gag him on arrest to avoid hearing what he might say?~
@6798 = ~No matter. I will get the praises of my superiors for bringing him in, and you will be heralded at your temple for sowing chaos and securing profit from it. I told you our relationship would be beneficial.~
@6799 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>, haven't you been busy. Quite the bit of skullduggery you have perpetrated. Talos cannot help but chuckle at the lengths you are willing to go for him and the spirit of destruction.~
@6800 = ~This has been a regrettable series of events, hasn't it? Poor Cotirso. He could not understand the will of Helm in this matter. Still, he chose his own fate, and that is empowering.~
@6801 = ~Still, a life was saved, though I don't hold much hope for what he will do with it. For now, all is well again.~

@6803 = ~Tonight, <CHARNAME>, You must enter the Talos temple and... and remove the threat to the coming of dawn. Kill Weathermistress Ada. She longs for our destruction, and she has given the order. You have little time, and the odds are great. Perhaps if Ada is struck down in the middle of their temple, they will think twice before attacking us. Be careful.~
@6804 = ~You must protect the temple of Lathander, repelling all that try to kill those within. Failing that, you must convince the Lathanderites not to launch a revenge attack. Righteous fury can be as deadly as villainy.~

@6806 = ~I should not wish to experience such again.~
@6807 = ~One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  Having reached this end, weaponers began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.  Another line of tinkering led to the integration of magic with spears.  Tribal shaman would enchant the spears so that they would hit more often and do greater damage to their wielder's opponents.

@6810 = ~Wait... one approaches, and his appearance seems familiar to me...~ [ANOMEN95]
@6811 = ~Sir Anomen, the former son of Lord Cor... I have found you, at last.  I have been looking for you for quite some time.~
@6812 = ~Ah, yes... you are the messenger who brought me tidings of my sister.  'Tis not more grim news you bear, is it?~
@6813 = ~Very well... give me your missive then, and be gone with my thanks.~
@6814 = ~The... the Magistrate... she writes: "... It is my regret to inform you that your father, Lord Cor, was killed in an attempt to take vengeance of the merchant, Saerk, on his own..."~
@6815 = ~"... Your father was reacting to recent evidence uncovered proving that Saerk Farrahd was, indeed, responsible for the hiring of the men that killed your sister, Moira..."~
@6816 = ~"... As a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, I trust that you will not take vengeance into your own hands.  The law will deal with Saerk Farrahd..."~
@6817 = ~"... I grieve for the loss of your family, and will do everything in my power to see that justice is done.  I hope this letter finds you before rumor does.  Sincerely, Bylanna Ianulin."~
@6818 = ~That... that merchant was responsible for Moira's death, after all... and father... he took it upon himself to take vengeance.  And... he is dead... all because of Saerk...~
@6819 = ~... You... you feel sorry...~
@6820 = ~... Forget... about Saerk...~
@6821 = ~... Justice... be done...~
@6822 = ~... Nay!  I speak of Saerk's involvement in this disaster, and yet I forget about yours!  It was you who pushed me not to avenge my sister when I had the chance!~
@6823 = ~I TOLD you that Saerk was responsible, <CHARNAME>!  And... and you had me turn it over to the law!  The law!  Saerk has so much gold that the law will never touch him!~
@6824 = ~Aaaah, I cannot believe I have done this!  For the Order, for you!  I turned my back on my family, on my duty... and look what has happened!~
@6825 = ~I... I am doing what I must.  Of all the vows I spoke, none of them can compare to the twisting in my heart, now.  My father... dead... doing what I should have done...~
@6826 = ~You... you I can forgive, at least, my love.  What you did... you meant well by me.  But Saerk... Saerk I cannot forgive.  The law will not provide justice on one as rich as he.~
@6827 = ~We have a confrontation that is inevitable, he and I.  I shirked my duty once, and I will not do it again.  I... I must leave you, <CHARNAME>, and do what I should have long ago.~
@6828 = ~The Order and everything else be damned, Saerk will die when I find him.  Fare... fare you well, then, my love.  I... I am sorry to do this to you...~
@6829 = ~Aye, but it is happening anyway.  I spoke vows to the Order, but they mean nothing, now, to the twisting of my heart.  My drunken father... dead for doing what was my duty...~
@6830 = ~I regret much, and now I must act on it no matter my vows.  My father is dead because I did not do my duty... dead because of an evil man's desire for wealth.~
@6831 = ~One of man's earliest weapons, dating back to the most primitive of times, the first spears were simply wooden poles or sticks sharpened at one end.  When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel.  This spear trembles from the powerful magic used in its creation.

@6834 = ~I see that you are no paladin of the Order after all.  Just as I suspected!  A brutish lout who cannot handle the competition, just as your father was!~
@6835 = ~Speak not of my father!  And I will not sit idly by and watch as you bribe and cajole your way into... into... what?  <CHARNAME>?!  What are you doing here?!~
@6836 = ~I fear your welcome will be a little cold, <CHARNAME>. We are still feeling the effects of the war you have let begin.~
@6837 = ~Because this is evil... this will take you down a path that will destroy you forever!~
@6838 = ~I... I had intended to do this myself.  There is no need for both of us to perform a necessary evil, my love.  But I... I will not stop whatever you intend.~
@6839 = ~Put up your sword, then, Saerk!  It grieves me that it has come to this, but it is my own fault that this did not occur sooner!  For Moira... and my father!!~
@6840 = ~Aye... aye, you speak the right of it, my love.  It... it is the guilt that crushes me beneath its weight.  That I walked away from my duty and my abominable father took it up!~
@6841 = ~There is an evil in my heart, I have always known this and I spoke of it to you.  Hate and anger, twisted and black... and I... I cannot control it.~
@6842 = ~My heart tells me to kill this demon... and my guilt will be assuaged.  I... I cannot live like this, <CHARNAME>... at any moment all I believe in I could betray...~
@6843 = ~I... I would put an end to this hate, my love.  If I could.  It destroyed my father, and now it threatens to destroy me.  But yet I do not know if I can...~
@6844 = ~I love you, too... but 'tis already done.  My family is dead and I am destroyed.  I am sorry... but my black heart demands nothing less than this demon's death!~
@6845 = ~In the pursuit of coin, you not only ruined my father... but you killed an innocent girl.  You have a daughter, do you not, Saerk?~
@6846 = ~... err... yes...~
@6847 = ~I hope you will be able to look your daughter in the eye when you are in prison... and I hope you will think on what you have done ere you go to the gods for judgement.~
@6848 = ~... I...~
@6849 = ~Then there is nothing more that needs to be said.  I will follow the dictates of my heart, though it leads me into darkness.  I... I am sorry, my love.~
@6850 = ~<CHARNAME>... I do truly love you, as I have said so many times before.  But it is not enough to assuage my dark heart.~
@6851 = ~I... I have ruined myself in the Order.  There is no place for me there, anymore.  I... I am too much my father's son.~
@6852 = ~I must go away, <CHARNAME>.  I must go somewhere into seclusion and see if I can live with this hate... try to... to quench it.  But I cannot stay with you.~
@6853 = ~You there!  You came in with this fool... what are your intentions?!~
@6854 = ~Only to tell you that you will pay for what you have done... according to the law.~
@6855 = ~I... I am sorry, m'<LADYLORD>.  All of the Delryns are dead an' gone, I fear... Lord Cor was killed by 'is son, that failed knight.  Then 'is son went an' killed himself.  Pity, that.  Tsk.~
@6856 = ~I am sorry, my <LADYLORD>... there is no one available at the house.  A former knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart broke into the house recently and murdered the merchant, Saerk.~

@6860 = ~**PLACEHOLDER FOR MOVIE**
Disaster comes on the heels of your victory in Baldur's Gate, and you are captured while resting outside the city. You know nothing of your assailant, save that you were beaten senseless with apparently minimal effort, and now you lie in a strange prison, awaiting your fate. Vague memories of torture and experimentation haunt you, leaving you battered and without hope. You do not know from where, or even if, help will come; the fate of your comrades is as much a mystery as your own current location.~
@6861 = ~Hmmn.  I don't seem to recall anyone being scheduled with me.  Aran certainly hasn't mentioned anything... mind you, he's too busy with that tart of his.  What is your name?~
@6862 = ~Eh?  Looking for Aran, are you?  Well, he doesn't meet with just anyone... you'll have to tear him away from the clutches of Tassa, first, and that won't be easy.~

@6865 = ~My name is none of your business... nor is my purpose.~
@6866 = ~<CHARNAME>, is it?  Fair enough.  I am Pelanna, Mistress of the Run.  This here is part of the training facility for the Shadow Thieves.  Did... did Renal send you here?~
@6867 = ~(sigh)  I get far too many of your type arriving, these days.  I don't care how mysterious you are, you know.  I am Pelanna, Mistress of the Run... I'll be in charge of your training, here.~
@6868 = ~Aran could help a great many people... the question is whether he will want to or not.  Hmm.  Well, you've been given access, so I won't stop you.~
@6869 = ~Ah.  I've never known Aran to treat gold as anything more than water... but if he's demanded a payment, likely he wants to see you, regardless.  Very well, I won't stop you.~
@6870 = ~Hmph.  Very well, then... it's not exactly me place to stop you.  You've been given access and look the decent sort, I suppose.~

@6874 = ~I doubt Aran Linvail... the Shadowmaster... would appreciate you sticking your nose into his business.  Perhaps we can ask him together?~
@6875 = ~Hold on one moment, Pelanna... don't be a fool.~
@6876 = ~(growl)  I'll gut that little harpy soon, I swear it.  Fine, then... you, <CHARNAME>.  You might have told me your purpose and spared me the aggravation.~
@6877 = ~Wait... wait a minute.  I remember, now.  Bah!  You might have saved me some aggravation and told me you were here to see Aran right off.  He's expecting you.~
@6878 = ~Hmmmn... so you're that <CHARNAME> that Aran was talking about.  My, my, but aren't you a cutie!  I just love pretty things... don't you think I'm pretty?  (giggle)~
@6879 = ~Hmmmn... so you're that <CHARNAME> that Aran has been talking about all the time.  I thought you'd be so much prettier.  But that's OK...(giggle)... I like you anyway!~
@6880 = ~Aran's in his chambers, yummy little <PRO_MANWOMAN>... go ahead and talk to him.  I'm finished with him... for now.  (giggle!)~
@6881 = ~You know where to go, don't you?  That cow, Pelanna, told you, I'm sure.  Well you just go on and talk to him, then, yummy little <PRO_MANWOMAN>... I'm done with him, for now.  (giggle!)~
@6882 = ~Oh... you don't want to talk to me, silly!  You don't have half as much money as my Aran baby!  You need a lot of gold to keep Tassa's attention.  (giggle!)~

@6898 = ~What is your purpose here?~
@6899 = ~It is, is it?  Very well, then. I must return to my mistress, a certain Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe.  Should you wish to speak with me again, my chaos birds, you may find me at her side.~
@6900 = ~We are the guardians of decay, the saboteurs of meaning, the agents of destiny.  And that destiny is that all things falter, all things fail.  The multiverse is a snake that has caught its tail in its mouth... and begun to swallow.~
@6901 = ~Are there many people to feed here?~
@6902 = ~I was to deliver an important gem to my mistress, Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe, but the late Mekrath chose to 'relieve' me of its possession.~
@6903 = ~I was to bring her a certain gem but Mekrath has stolen it from me and I do not have the time to search for it among his belongings... although I seem to remember it being in an altar, here.~
@6904 = ~Between comrades, no apologies are needed. Instead let me offer you a gift: Upon my capture, Mekrath took from me a certain gem and hid it in this place... in an altar, if I remember right...~
@6905 = ~I ask only one favor of you: here in this place... in an altar, I believe... rests a gem that was stolen from me by yon mage. While the buzzards and the grave robbers shall have his body, I must have that gem.~
@6906 = ~Is it your disrespect that has made the servants so placid?~
@6907 = ~As for how you can help me, I can ask but one favor: upon my capture, Mekrath stole from me a most important gem... I only have a hazy recollection of it being in an altar, here.~
@6908 = ~I will go, then, as my mistress no doubt waits for me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe. But please, before I go, let me beg of you one last seed of destiny...~
@6909 = ~Good, I'm glad you think so, but let's get something straight: I'm not your slave, I'm not your whipping boy... I'm someone who you're going to need.~
@6910 = ~Before your dear friend Mekrath threw me into chains, he took from me a certain gem that I was delivering to a close acquaintance of mine, Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe.~
@6911 = ~Aye, then, your slave I am and let the slave enrich the master: Mekrath has squirreled away a gem of great value within this place.  It was once mine and I was to deliver it to Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe...~
@6912 = ~Then make it neither fate nor luck. Come visit me by choice and by the force of will triumphant. I am an actor under Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe and was to deliver to her a certain costume gem.~
@6913 = ~If you can find it, I pray that you return it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe, beneath the Five Flagons Inn, for it is there that I abide.~
@6914 = ~Nay, he merely captured me because I held a gem that he was coveting. I was to deliver it to Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe, beneath the Five Flagons Inn.~
@6915 = ~Tell you what: I must return to Mistress Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe, with whom I have been associated now for many years.  I was delivering a gem to her when yon mage abducted me into his keeping.~
@6916 = ~Well spoken, my dark and rescuing raven. I have an appointment to keep with Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe but perhaps you could assist me, yet.~
@6917 = ~It is, my raven, it is... Now allow me to add a mystery of my own to your cabal.  Prior to my capture by yon corpse, I was delivering an important gem to Miss Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe beneath the Five Flagons.~
@6918 = ~Ah, then allow me to arrange for another meeting that might be in your interest: Prior to my capture by yon corpse, I had in my possession a certain gem of great personal value.~
@6919 = ~Just as you have your orders, I had mine: I was to deliver that gem to Raelis Shai, the mistress of the Sigil theater troupe beneath the Five Flagons Inn.~
@6920 = ~I was to bring her a certain piece of costume jewelry, but yon mage has taken it from me and hidden it in an altar, here, I think.  If you happen to come across it, I have no doubt that Miss Raelis will reward you for the effort.~
@6921 = ~Prior to my capture by yon mage, I carried with me a gem of great personal significance.  I seem to remember it in an altar, here... find it and my mistress at the playhouse, Raelis Shai, will reward you greatly for its delivery.~
@6922 = ~Well, if you'll not have me, the Sigil theater troupe surely will... But let there be no hard feelings between us: you have given me my freedom and for that I am grateful.~
@6923 = ~Let us turn to more practical matters, then.  Prior to falling into Mekrath's foul grasp, I carried with me a gem of great importance.  I was to deliver it to Raelis Shai, mistress of the Sigil theater troupe.~
@6924 = ~You've never walked the Planes, then, have you.  Never seen the horrors of the Abyss, never fallen under the gaze of the Lady Of Pain, never marched through the Quasielemental Plane of Dust in the retinue of a Baalor...~
@6925 = ~Aye, the distaste was mutual. He stole a gem from me upon my capture, placing it in an altar, here, and should the ant ever care to perform a service for the grub, you may deliver it to me at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe.~
@6926 = ~The mace is a direct descendant of the basic club, being nothing more than a wooden shaft with an iron head mounted on the end.  The shaft of this magical mace seems to guide the wielder, becoming an extension of his hand.

@6927 = ~No, I shall return to my mistress with the Sigil theater troupe and should you ever care to renegotiate our mutual distaste for each other, I suggest you bring a gift...~
@6928 = ~Very well.  My memories are hazy, but I believe it to be in an altar, here. Once it is recovered, we must bring it to Raelis Shai, mistress of the Sigil theater troupe, for she will reward us handsomely for such a service.~
@6929 = ~I shall be staying at the playhouse of the Sigil theater troupe, currently beneath the Five Flagons Inn, where my mistress shall reward you most admirably for the safe conduct of the jewel.~
@6930 = ~Fine, fine, take the gem and with my blessing. It is a petty costume jewel that I was to deliver to Mistress Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe.~
@6931 = ~Mayhaps you shall, mayhaps you shan't. Afore this ruffled raven flies, I must tell you of one thing: in an altar here in the mage's lair is a most important gem.~
@6932 = ~Prior to my capture I was to deliver it to Mistress Raelis Shai of the Sigil theater troupe, currently beneath the Five Flagons Inn. If you find it, please make the delivery in my stead as it is important that she receives it.~
@6933 = ~A crossbow is a bow mounted crosswise on a wooden or metal shaft, and usually made of ash or yew.  This particular weapon has been enchanted with an aspect of life from the plane of air, harnessed by a master sorcerer.  The aspect acts as a guiding hand, directing bolts to strike true and for more damage than normal.

@6934 = ~<CHARNAME>, if we be parting ways, then let me give to you the deeds to the playhouse in Amn. May it be yours and may all who serve you do so gallantly...~
@6935 = ~You... you're nothing like I thought! I will have no part of you!~ [NALIA06]
@6936 = ~I'm afraid I'm the needy one now... help me, please.~ [NALIA15]
@6937 = ~Yes, Miss Raelis.  Ah... my ravens, there be a tale between us that is long overdue: forgive me if I led you to believe that yon gem was just a worthless bauble for the stage.~
@6938 = ~As you are well aware, this playhouse in which we stand is property of the Sigil theater troupe, which is to say Miss Raelis, myself, and our company of fellow actors.~
@6939 = ~Little did we know that the sordid tale of lust between two certain planar beings might hold a mirror to the truth.  Within hours the theater was left in ruins and a price was placed upon our fleeing heads.~
@6940 = ~Yes, Miss Raelis.  Ah... my ravens, there be a tale between us that is long overdue:  Forgive me if I led you to believe that yon gem was just a worthless bauble for the stage.~
@6941 = ~A crossbow is a bow mounted crosswise on a wooden or metal shaft, the latter called a tiller.  The bow is usually made of ash or yew.  The crossbow fires a quarrel (also called a bolt).  This magical crossbow is elegant and light in the hand, with little recoil.

@6942 = ~His wished you to be recognized for your heroics.   You truly exemplify the paladin spirit, and I would have you demonstrate it further.~
@6943 = ~It would be an honor to serve in any way that I can.~
@6944 = ~Then you shall continue under the guidance of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. You could ask for no better a patron.~
@6945 = ~The cause shall be just if you perform as you should. Do not neglect your own quests, but treat your assignments with urgency. Go to William Reirrac now.~
@6946 = ~I am not asking you to forever forgo your own agenda, just set it aside for a short time.  This offer will not be made again. Decide well and forever.~
@6947 = ~I look forward to the reports of your achievements. I'm sure you will not betray our faith in your ability.~
@6948 = ~It is a great shame that you did not wish to join the Order. You would have been a great asset, though I am sure you still serve the cause of righteousness.~
@6949 = ~You have disgraced the Order and all that it stands for. Find your way as you will, but you will get no help from here.~
@6950 = ~You have done much for the cause of good, even while mistakenly under the guise of a villain. Speak with the Prelate, for he would have the Order make amends.~
@6951 = ~Your refusal is mystifying. Go with our good graces, but remember what you have lost here today.~
@6952 = ~Your name is spoken well of by those that matter most. Go to the Prelate, for he has much to say.~
@6953 = ~You have proven unworthy of the Order. Go and seek your fortune elsewhere, for you will find no sanctuary here.~
@6954 = ~Tyr does live in your actions. Go to the Prelate, that your peers might honor you.~
@6955 = ~I heard of your service to the cause of goodness, but you will not be taking orders from me on this matter. Go to the Prelate, I will speak of other things later.~
@6956 = ~I hope the Order agrees with me. My beliefs are very strict.~
@6957 = ~I will go this instant! Others of the Order will not fall while I stand idle!~
@6958 = ~I will leave as soon as I restock and rest up.~
@6959 = ~You have returned, as have our observing runners. The battle was bloody and fierce, and the outcome all but certain.~
@6960 = ~Only one of our order fell once you joined the fray, though it is a sad loss. She was a squire, the future of the Order, and barely knew life's fleeting wonder.~
@6961 = ~You have betrayed us with your slothfulness.  Did you think me not serious when I said that time was of the essence? You are hereby expelled from the Order.~
@6962 = ~Is there nothing I can do? I am sincere in my apology.~
@6963 = ~But we cannot rest upon our laurels for long. There is still much for our kind to do, as the villainous do not rest while we do.~
@6964 = ~Listen, you little maggot!  I want to know how you got your collar off, right now... or you'll find there are far worse things than being a slave!~
@6965 = ~What?  Others?  Ah... the primes.  How foolish of you to have followed your actor friends here.  Von'ith, close the portal, please.~
@6966 = ~It doesn't matter... I'm here to rescue my friends.~
@6967 = ~Not really... just came through for a bit of sight-seeing, really.~
@6968 = ~This place is one of the finest prisons in the planes.  There is no way out of here... except at the whim of the cambion.  What fools you must be to come here of your own volition.~
@6969 = ~I am new to the Order. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@6970 = ~No matter.  I expect you'll bring a grand price from the cambion as new thralls.  Hunters... take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@6971 = ~Oh, you are a sharp one, prime.  I'm afraid it's much, much worse than that.~
@6972 = ~Hah!  Witless and full of bravado, as well.  You've experience in your bearing, of that I have no doubt... but if you think your arrival will help your friends, you are quite wrong.~
@6973 = ~Then you are more witless than I mistook you for.  This is a poor choice for a sight-seeing trip, prime... as it will likely be your last.~
@6974 = ~<CHARNAME>... I do not know it, but I am just a squire. You must have impressed the Prelate if you are a full member. I... I should go. There is much to report...~
@6975 = ~Ah, of course. I am but a squire and still unsure as to how far I might take liberties talking. I will go report these horrible circumstances.  Thank you again.~
@6976 = ~Thank the Wounded One for saving Shamus today,  I feared his wounds too grave. Elotte however... I will weep for her. She would have made a fine knight.~
@6977 = ~I must take solace in the teachings of the Maimed God, for I share his pain. Elotte and Shamus... They shall be missed by all that knew them.~
@6978 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I am new to the Order. I wish I could have helped more.~
@6979 = ~We must reflect on what we have done. Action without thought is mere instinct, and there is no righteousness in that.  You will learn this in the Order. Go if you must.~
@6980 = ~I must speak of these villainous events to the Order... to mourn the losses and exalt the successes. This is the hardest part of the journey. Fear it, young one.~
@6981 = ~'Tis a case of the pot calling the kettle black, I would think. Suit yourself. I must pick up the pieces and go on, to honor the fallen.~
@6982 = ~Of course you did. I always dread the walk home. The glory of the fight is more fulfilling than picking up the pieces afterwards. Farewell.~
@6983 = ~I... I thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, for your timely rescue.  I am afraid I did not give much thought as to what I would do after I removed my collar.~
@6984 = ~The warden keeps a large number of slaves here... prisoners that have been turned into thralls by a magical collar that they wear that controls them.  They are next to impossible to remove.~
@6985 = ~Mine had a small flaw in it, and I was able to squirm out of it not long ago... only to find that there was almost nowhere for me to go, here, and danger down every corridor.~
@6986 = ~There be no physical exit that I know of.  The portals lead only to other rooms within the prison, and there are no doors or windows... if, indeed, there is even an outside to speak of, here.~
@6987 = ~No... the only way one can leave is through the use of magic.  Powerful magic that only a few might have, to attract a conduit to this dim and forsaken place.~
@6988 = ~You mentioned a collar... what did you mean by that?~
@6989 = ~Hello, father.  Are you... are you coming home for a while?~
@6990 = ~You are friends of the actors?  Ahhh... then you may as well begin mourning them, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  They are in the warden's cells, awaiting transport to Duke Rowan's tower, I am told.~
@6991 = ~The warden is directly north of here, through the hallway... but I would advise against going down that path.~
@6992 = ~You will see on the floor markings that the tanar'ri have left with their magic... portals that transport you to the other rooms of this prison.~
@6993 = ~There is another way to reach the warden... a safer way, perhaps, that may serve your purpose and perhaps mine, as well.  Might I tell you of it?~
@6994 = ~Er... if you could but tarry a moment, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I could perhaps offer you some small assistance... something that would aid me, as well.~
@6995 = ~The passage to the east leads to the chambers of the Master of Thralls... a lesser tanar'ri who holds a device that I know allows him to control the collars.~
@6996 = ~Destroy that device and the thralls are freed.  The warden is vulnerable... and I will be able to contact my newly freed friends.  Some of them are mages who will teleport us away.~
@6997 = ~As well, the portals on the floors to the east may be avoided... they lead only to other cells, I understand, and are full of naught but violent and dangerous creatures.~
@6998 = ~I... I would not offer this chance, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, if I did not think you might have a chance against the warden, himself.  I can think of no other way for either of us to escape this place, truly.~
@6999 = ~There are many old and powerful magics in this prison, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  We might get away briefly, but the prison's magic would track us... and the warden would send powerful hunters very quickly.~
@7000 = ~Forget it... I will try to find my own way out of here.~
@7001 = ~Then... then I wish you well, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  I, myself, shall remain here where it is safe... for now.~
@7002 = ~Then all hope is lost.  I... I hope you find some way out, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, I truly do.~
@7003 = ~I care not for bureaucratic types, but I serve the will of the Order.~
@7004 = ~Be most careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!  I understand the Master of Thralls to be a fearsome opponent!  But... but you must destroy his device!  The thralls must be free!~
@7005 = ~You have destroyed the orb, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?  I... I almost did not believe it possible!  How wondrous!~
@7006 = ~Is... is there something that I can do for you, my <LADYLORD>?  I shall do anything I can, in return for the kindness you have paid me.~
@7007 = ~The Baron waits in a neutral meeting place. He is in a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. Go now.~
@7008 = ~You mentioned a plan you had to get us out of here... tell me about it, please.~
@7009 = ~I see.  Well... I shall wish you luck, regardless, in escaping this place.~
@7010 = ~Ah... I see you have the orb with you, my <LADYLORD>.  I think the brazier in the room just east of here might serve to destroy it... if anything can.~
@7011 = ~We... we... attack them!  Attack them and kill them all!!~
@7012 = ~Hmmmn... vermin, I see.  Come, my pretty thralls.  These are no escaped prisoners... these are invaders!  We must destroy them for my master!~
@7013 = ~You... you have killed the master!  You have killed him!!  By Clangeddin's Axe, I thought such a thing not even possible!~
@7014 = ~Y-yes... the Warden is in the great chamber just west of here, down the hall.  B-but... do you not want to destroy the orb, first?~
@7015 = ~Y-yes... it is the orb he carries... the orb of mastery!  I... I cannot touch it so long as I wear this collar.  But if you wish to destroy it, you can...~
@7016 = ~You must take the orb to the room south of here with the magical brazier in the center... the flames will surely destroy the orb and free all the thralls, here, in the process!~
@7017 = ~I... I must flee before the Warden discovers that the Master of Thralls is dead!  Please... destroy the orb if you are able!  I beg you!!~
@7018 = ~There... there is no way out!  No way at all!  Unless... unless you destroy the orb, I suppose.  That... that would free all the thralls...~
@7019 = ~The thralls could... we could remove our collars... and the Warden would be unprotected.  Killing the Warden is... is the only way out, I think.  I... I don't know...~
@7020 = ~I cannot touch the orb so long as I wear the collar... and I cannot remove the collar without the orb's destruction...~
@7021 = ~There... there is a room to the south... you can reach it through the chambers of the Warden's pet.  Although... although I suppose you already came through that way...~
@7022 = ~But... beyond it is a chamber with a brazier in the center.  The magical flames might... might serve to destroy the orb.  It is the only way I can think to do this...~
@7023 = ~Y-yes... that is the only way.  I wish you well... if you take on the warden...~
@7024 = ~Ah... you are the pitiful group of fools from the prime material plane, I see.  Well, you will disturb my prison no further.  No one escapes this place... no one.~
@7025 = ~Call on the Master of Thralls... I wish to know what is occurring, here.  I will tear this plane apart to have those filthy slaves returned!  I will flay the skin from their...~
@7026 = ~... what is this?  You are not my guards!  It... it is you!!  You are causing these problems!!  I shall take the rest of eternity to make you suffer!!~
@7027 = ~You... you have defeated the Warden and freed us all.  I wish I had some better way to thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, but I have little doubt you will find a way home on your own.~
@7028 = ~Please... accept my most heart-felt thanks.  The thralls who were once imprisoned here shall always remember you.~
@7029 = ~I am of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, and I will support the side of right.~
@7030 = ~Order! Is that what the Baron Metrich calls it? I suppose he would think so, but he wasn't here first. His order is a lot different than this place used to be.~
@7031 = ~Are you now? Then maybe you'll be a voice of reason. Not like anyone has cared up until now. Brush the squatters away, even if they were here before.~
@7032 = ~You want the whole story, you ask around. Go to your meeting with all sides known and make your mind up then. Do that, and maybe we'll get what we deserve.~
@7033 = ~I am well worried by what has gone on in this place. Though the choice seems clear and right I am hesitant to take it.~ [ANOMENA7]
@7034 = ~Baron Metrich took over just recently. He's been trying to run us out, preferring private hunting grounds to our farms. He's taxed, burned, and raided!~
@7035 = ~It's not surprising. You are probably lying to protect yourself and I will believe no more.~
@7036 = ~And, here... I have procured a key for the place from one of his servants.  Take it, Anomen.  Go... go and avenge our Moira.  Let justice be done.~
@7037 = ~Then I shall go there. The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart would not wish I miss it.~
@7038 = ~You do not love me anymore? ... I ... I have always loved you and I always shall.  However well I hide it, every day I spend without you is a day that's lost forever.~
@7039 = ~I am not comfortable wandering about in the dark. The shadows could hold anyone... anything.~ [NALIA20]
@7040 = ~I will not harm you without cause. I am from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.~
@7041 = ~But that is how I was in the circus when I was kept in a--a cage.  It was horrible, Valygar, but Quayle came and healed me... healed my sores where...~
@7042 = ~The arms and legs seem melded with the sarcophagus. You may not remove them while their guardian still lives.~
@7043 = ~Psychic Drain~
@7044 = ~When you touch the bones, a wave of nausea and fear washes over you. Covering your hands, you carefully place the arms and legs in your pack.~
@7045 = ~Who are you?  Oh, whoever you are, you must flee this place at once!  He... he's killed everyone else who has come into this place, almost!  Oh, please run!~ [AERIE01]
@7046 = ~Kalah!  Oh, I don't know what he's done, exactly, or how... but everything here is an illusion!  But it's magic that can hurt you, if you believe in it...~
@7047 = ~Oh, you probably don't understand, do you?  I... I don't know what he's done to the tent or with the others who have come in, but their deaths are real!  You must run!~
@7048 = ~I... I'm not a monster!  I'm an elf, a winged elf... or at least I was...~
@7049 = ~This... this covering you see is some kind of illusion, but if you believe in it then it becomes real!  P-please believe me! Now go before something happens to you, I beg of you!~
@7050 = ~Perhaps you're right, then... I should go.~
@7051 = ~Oh, I hope you don't end up like... like the others!  But, alright... m-my name is Aerie.  I... work in the circus with my uncle, Quayle...~
@7052 = ~I don't know exactly what happened, but everything changed a few days ago... everything became chaos and turned into what you see here.  Although it all isn't real, it's an illusion...~
@7053 = ~The minions... they all say they serve Kalah, so I know he's behind all of this... he's an illusionist in the circus, but I don't understand how he was able to do all of this!~
@7054 = ~He must be stopped!  Before he hurts any more people!  Please... if... if you release me from my chains, I can help you stop him!~
@7055 = ~No!  No, you don't underst... RrrrRRAARGH!  I WILL KILL YOU ALL!!~
@7056 = ~Yes!  Go, if you can!  I... I don't want to see any more people hurt!~
@7057 = ~I... I come from a race of winged elves... although there aren't many of us left.  From the Sundabar Mountains in the far North.  My wings were cut off a long time ago, though...~
@7058 = ~But... but that isn't important!  This place is too dangerous!  Go back to the city and warn everyone what is happening here!  You must flee!~
@7059 = ~The chains are invisible... covered by the illusion.  And... and they are magical... they prevent me from casting my own spells and they maintain the illusion which is placed on me...~
@7060 = ~You... you need the key to these chains.  But... but it won't look like a key!  There are a couple of... commoners... in the north side of this chamber...~
@7061 = ~Don't be fooled by the illusion, though... they are monsters!  They have a sword which is actually my key... if you get it from them, I can remove the chain and regain my normal form!~
@7062 = ~But please be careful!  You... you can't trust anything you see, here!~
@7063 = ~I don't know... I tried, earlier, when this first happened.  Kalah's spells are too powerful, somehow.  He's... he's never been that good, though, so I don't know what he's done...~
@7064 = ~If you free me, though, together we can find out and stop him!  And... and hopefully rescue my Uncle, Quayle...~
@7065 = ~Alright, then... but be careful!  And don't trust anything that you see!  And... and please save my Uncle, Quayle!  Please!~
@7066 = ~You... you aren't going to help anyone?  But... well, if you must... if that's safest...~
@7067 = ~If... if you're not going to flee, then maybe you can help free me from the chains that keep me bound in this form... and then maybe I can help you!~ [AERIED1]
@7068 = ~I will do what is just. I am from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.~
@7069 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps I am here to do the job.~
@7070 = ~I don't see any chains... what are you referring to?~
@7071 = ~I'm sorry, but I have no time to help you... I must confront this Kalah quickly!~
@7072 = ~You... you haven't found the sword?  Oh, please hurry!  The... the peasants who have it are on the north side of the chamber... but they aren't what they seem!~ [AERIED2]
@7073 = ~Have... have you found Quayle?~ [AERIEC9]
@7074 = ~Not yet... and I would appreciate your help.  Please join me and we will look together.~
@7075 = ~Yes... this is it, this is the planar sphere here in the slums.  We should... climb the stairs and find some manner of entrance.  If I am right, my blood, my presence should open the sphere...~ [VALYGA70]
@7076 = ~I am dying... and I wish to die there.  Under my own sun.~
@7077 = ~In return... in return I shall tell you how to return the sphere to our own plane.  I... I am glad that you entered the sphere when you did.~
@7078 = ~I was able to keep from the force... the fact that the sphere had a defense against intrusion.  It would automatically travel to another plane...~
@7079 = ~A trap... that would allow me to deal with the intruders... at will.  But... that was another time.  Bring me home, Valygar Corthala, and I will tell you how...~
@7080 = ~Very well.  The sphere... the sphere is powered by the heart of a powerful demon.  Our last trip, now, would have depleted the power source of the last heart the sphere had...~
@7081 = ~Bring the heart to the engine room of the sphere and place it inside the engine golem at the center there... and I will pre-set the controls while you are gone.~
@7082 = ~But go quickly, Valygar... there are things that will stir in the planes and take notice of the sphere now that it is here!  Go!  And I... will try to hang on long enough...~
@7083 = ~We have returned to our home plane, have we?  Then I... then I shall complete Lavok's request.  Excuse me, <CHARNAME>... I will go outside with my ancestor...~
@7084 = ~I have had an age and more to consider my sins.  If I could call it all back... if I could call back my brother and my son... my granddaughter and grandsons... I...~
@7085 = ~The... the sphere has been moved.  I can sense this.  It was... an automatic defense against intrusion that I kept hidden from the presence...~
@7086 = ~But now that the presence is gone, you need to return to your home plane.  I... I shall tell you how, in return for one thing... one small thing...~
@7087 = ~I have been traveling for so long... I wish to see my home one last time.  When... we return to the Prime, take me outside, and let me die under the sky of the place I was born...~
@7088 = ~Very good.  The... the sphere is powered by the heart of a powerful demon.  Or... or at least it was.  You must go outside of the sphere... and get another heart.~
@7089 = ~I know this will be difficult, but you defeated the presence... so I hope that you will have strength enough for this last task.  Get a heart... and return...~
@7090 = ~But go... go quickly.  I do not know how much longer I can maintain my existence...~
@7091 = ~Then... then you will be stuck here on this plane.  As am I.  I... I hope you will think about this, <PRO_RACE>, and think quickly.  I have as little wish to die here as you do...~
@7092 = ~But you are... no longer... on your home plane.  Bargain with me, stranger... and I shall tell you how to return...~
@7093 = ~Very well... let me hear what you wish.~
@7094 = ~So... have you decided differently?  Have you... seen that there is no other way home?~ [LAVOK11]
@7095 = ~As... as you wish.  But I would not wait much... longer...~
@7096 = ~You must find the heart of a demon, you must!!  It... it must be strong enough to power the sphere!  Go, <RACE>!~ [LAVOK12]
@7097 = ~Yes... yes!  That heart will do!  Go to the engine room... and place it within the golem!  Go, quickly!~ [LAVOK13]
@7098 = ~We... we are returned to our own plane.  Please... please, stranger.  As per our bargain... let me see my sun one last time...~ [LAVOK14]
@7099 = ~No, I do not trust you... you may yet pull some trick!~
@7100 = ~I... am most grateful.  If... you could but carry me, my strength has all but fled... my last moments... are upon me...~ [LAVOK15]
@7101 = ~Aye... it is nothing less than I expected.  I deserve nothing more, I suppose, after all my evil...~ [LAVOK16]

@7103 = ~... I... I sense within you... a kindred power.  You... you are a mage, yes?~
@7104 = ~Yes... I see that you are.  I... I grant you the sphere, mage.  Do... do with it far... far better than I ever did.  It is yours... to use wisely...~
@7105 = ~Why not?  We can't leave th' farm to rot completely... we have t' eat, aye, me <LADYLORD>?~
@7106 = ~Er... talk to Erlin if you wish t' discuss the chickens, me <LADYLORD>.  I'll have nothin' t' do with it.~
@7107 = ~I know your secret, old man... give me the chicken or there's going to be trouble.~
@7108 = ~I'm only interested in one chicken, truly... a chicken that swallowed something quite valuable...~
@7109 = ~I... you're a terrible, evil <MANWOMAN>, you are!  'Tis all I have left of my daughter!  All we have in the world, dead!  Dead!~
@7110 = ~I'll pay you fairly for it... then you don't have to hide it anymore.~
@7111 = ~Give up the ruse, old man... I know your secret.  Hand over the chicken!~
@7112 = ~(sigh)  I s'pose it's best not t' be hangin' onto it any longer.  Eventually someone will come an' take it from us.  What... what can ye pay me for it, me <LADYLORD>?~
@7113 = ~100 gold pieces... more than fair, I am sure.~
@7114 = ~Forget it... I've changed my mind.~
@7115 = ~Nay, Enna, there be no sense in causin' trouble over it.  Here you go, stranger... I hope it makes you happy wi' yourself.~
@7116 = ~'Tis a terrible price, seein' as me daughter paid for it with her life.  But if it must be, it must be.  Here... an' I hope it makes ye happy with yerself.~
@7117 = ~Aye... aye, 'tis more than fair.  This will pay for a fine headstone for our daughter an' more.  A better tribute than a hidden gem in a chicken.  Take it, then... you've been more an' kind.~
@7118 = ~My daughter, she is gone! She was home when I left and now she is gone! There is debris about my home and this note was there ... and there is blood!~
@7119 = ~My son, he is gone! He was there when I left, but now... This note was at the scene and there is debris about my home and... and there is blood!~
@7120 = ~You charge ahead, of valor born, the best of your parental blood commingled here within you, their very destinies made true by your every righteous act!~
@7121 = ~I delight so at the sparrows twittering above and look... there passes a prancing squirrel, all delighted by the softness of our approach!~
@7122 = ~That fortune... brought us no end of grief, however.  My family eventually took up his past-time, as well, to my sorrow.~
@7123 = ~... and a body built for untold pleasures that I would fall for such an old ploy?  Blow a little sunshine and I will fall all over myself to gain your favor?  Best think again, dark one.~
@7124 = ~You're a dreamer, bard.  I'm sure you can imagine lots of wonderful scenes... but they would not exceed the truth in intensity, depravity or tenure, I assure you.~
@7125 = ~Yes you do. You should follow in here. It is safe. The orcs let us be safe in there. You should come in.~
@7126 = ~Gosh... you're an adventurer, aren't you?  Hey, Derbert... this <MANWOMAN>'s an adventurer!  Wow!!~
@7127 = ~You have met my father, <CHARNAME>... surely you have some inkling, from his manner alone if nothing else.~
@7128 = ~You needn't be so impudent, child.  The woman is pleasing to the eye and doth stir the loins and I was merely complimenting upon her comeliness.~
@7129 = ~Ho, Haer'Dalis, your poetry ennobles me far beyond my worth.  I am a simple man and by simple decisions, I have made my way about this earth.~
@7130 = ~Ha.  There are countless books within our holy libraries where bored and dreamy scribes have penned petty blasphemies into the margins.~ [KELDOR65]
@7131 = ~"I knew a girl from a distant world,
across the planar deep,
and to her place, to see her face,

@7132 = ~Oh dear, I hope I didn't write that one down for posterity!  Heh... you should be proud of yourself, Yoshimo: you've just made an old knight blush.~
@7133 = ~The very gods granted us dominion here and Ao placed the races that they might flourish and be fruitful.  It is a destiny made manifest, druid.~
@7134 = ~I am old but, in what time I have left to me, I shall do all in my power to maintain the sanctity of your soul...~
@7135 = ~I know that you bring with you a troubled past and a painful heritage but, for all the friendship that has formed between us, I cannot turn from such transgressions forever...~ [KELDOR82]
@7136 = ~Dig...? You torment wit' funny words and projecting voice. You gonna kill, just says so.  I scream now. Gaaaahh!~
@7137 = ~More!  I would know more of this place!  Tell me what defenses Lord Jierdan has!~
@7138 = ~Defenses? Lord Firkraag no need defenses. You silly to think so. We hunt the feed and guard the home, but he not need us protect him.~
@7139 = ~Your pity and endowments only serve to perpetuate their condition and diminish their motivation to improve their lot.~
@7140 = ~Your joviality is a clever cloak to hide agenda and ambitions... but I'll be sure to armor my back to deflect the blade you'll surely aim there.~
@7141 = ~The mandate of your loyal order is deception and ruse, so misery is just another disguise for your gang of holy thugs' agenda is my guess.  Yes?~
@7142 = ~You... you really wish to know? Then listen carefully. I know we have not been behaving well, and we have, in fact, k-killed a number of the Baron's guards, but it has not been unprovoked!~
@7143 = ~Oh.  Me sad.  But fingers happy!  If DigDag is dead, I free free free! Been nice cookin' you!~
@7144 = ~Pleased that ye think so, dog-flogger.  I had t' act on a couple occasions... out o' necessity, like when we happened upon a hive of giants.~
@7145 = ~It is too bad that you won't take Aerie with you.  She should see the world.  Think about it, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>... talk to her when you get the chance.~
@7146 = ~I ask that you take Aerie with you again, to see the world... but it is your affair, after all.  It does my heart ill to see her cooped up here, though.~
@7147 = ~This is the way, I just knows it. A southern tomb within the opened cavern. Bloody old, it be.~ [KORGAN82]
@7148 = ~That's one fine mess that I done cleaned up. They did the killin', but I ends up with the gold, the book, and the satisfaction o' kickin' their tails. Ah... a good day.~ [KORGAN83]
@7149 = ~I thought you might want to talk to me. Travin said you have something I want.~
@7150 = ~W-what of it? You... you from them Talassans? I gots what you be looking for, but only for a price.~
@7151 = ~There is no place for friendship or compassion in the theater of gods, <CHARNAME>... as I am sure you are beginning to learn, if not understand.~
@7152 = ~My own thoughts, my own shoes, my own BODY!  These are all that matter!~
@7153 = ~Y-yes, of course. I am very, very sorry. Very sorry.~
@7154 = ~If you have the need of me again, you'll find me at the Five Flagons inn, where the playhouse once was... or not, as the whim takes me.  Farewell, my wandering raven!~
@7155 = ~Treat our kinship as if it never were... for we'll not see one another again.  This sparrow flies... farewell or not, I do not care.~
@7156 = ~Aye, I expected this... and verily I am half-glad that the time has come for our parting, my sour raven.  I tire of your antics and would be done with them.~
@7157 = ~I'm sorry for what happened before... will you join me again, Haer'Dalis?~
@7158 = ~Aye... the raven and the sparrow, together!  It will be good to voyage with you, <CHARNAME>!~
@7159 = ~Aye, but 'tis always such.  Nay, I have other things more pleasant than traveling with one such as yourself.  Find another, my raven.~
@7160 = ~Mmmm... very well, <CHARNAME>.  Let in not be said that this actor has no heart.  I can forgive... and besides, it is exciting to voyage with you.  Let us go, then, my raven!~
@7161 = ~Aye, and greetings to you, too.  I have business to attend to, however... and I suspect so do you.  'Til we meet again, my raven.~
@7162 = ~So... the rescuers of our beloved Haer'Dalis have come to us, at last.  Haer'Dalis has preceded you and spoken of you well.  Here is a reward for his return.~ [RAELIS13]
@7163 = ~Now... do you have the gem he spoke of, child?  The portal gem that Mekrath had in his keeping?~
@7164 = ~No, I don't... but I intend on getting it.~
@7165 = ~Perhaps... how much is the stone worth to you?~
@7166 = ~Yes, well, regrets to be dealt with another day. You say you have come to take delivery of something?~
@7167 = ~We... we still do not have it, Miss Raelis, try though I might to convince my raven of its import.  I shall endeavour to speed the process, if you will it.~
@7168 = ~So I ask you. Are you currently in service to Talos? Are you loyal to him and him alone? And may he strike you down if you are lying.~
@7169 = ~Then you will not have the item. Leave me.~
@7170 = ~I am only Lanka's assistant. If you wish something, best you speak to her or the Baron directly.~
@7171 = ~Yes, it is a simple matter now that you are here. I require some squatters removed from my lands.  They will respect the word of the Order and go.~
@7172 = ~The Order was insistent that I support you, and that is what I intend to do, whatever the details.~
@7173 = ~I have a small problem. One of the farmers claimed the land was theirs, not yours.~
@7174 = ~You would not wish to disappoint a potential friend of the Order, would you?  These louts have assaulted my men. Deal with them in the proper fashion.~
@7175 = ~Ahh, but you have proven reasonable yourself in responding to my concerns. I am content to aid you in this.~
@7176 = ~You have spoken with everyone that you need to.   I would have you state your intent with no more delays!~
@7177 = ~I will have my men continue without your aid. Your authority could have made the expulsion more diplomatic, but my men will do what they must.  Leave here!~
@7178 = ~I'm sure that, as we speak, the nobles argue over the relative benefits of white and red Evermeet wine, merely a thousand gold pieces per glass.~ [NALIA52]
@7179 = ~Of course you will. Since you have declared it here, the farmers will not oppose a member of the Order as they have opposed me.~
@7180 = ~Lanka? Have they assembled outside? I was told they might.~
@7181 = ~It would appear so, though they are more armed for battle than debate.~
@7182 = ~Your help has been appreciated, but I no longer have cause to speak with you. Lanka and I must set about building my regulated hunting range.~
@7183 = ~Stop your feeding, my spiders! New victims await! Protect your home!~
@7184 = ~But why do we need to continue this discussion?  You have already begun cleansing the area.  One dead? Two? No matter. It will put fear into them.~
@7185 = ~Regardless, you have earned my gratitude. With this simple, brutal act you have solved my problem. Go now, and tell your masters that I am pleased.~
@7186 = ~It was a regrettable thing, but I had a duty to fulfill.~
@7187 = ~I had little choice in the matter, though I will take pleasure in a job well done.~
@7188 = ~Do not quibble over details. All is well.~
@7189 = ~Moreno... no. Would you have us fight agents of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart? Matrich's men are one thing, but knights of the Order? No.~
@7190 = ~It is over, Moreno, just as the Baron hoped it would be. We cannot fight such a group as the Order. The word of law has been passed here, and we are on the losing side.~
@7191 = ~We'll fight you! Here and now if we have to!~
@7192 = ~Lanka? Is this true?~
@7193 = ~What would be your concern? Your hands are far from clean in this matter, my dear. Your precious animals and environment have made you a turncoat.~
@7194 = ~The state of the land is important, but I did not agree to this.~
@7195 = ~This is not open for discussion! What matters is the land I want and the people that must get off it!~
@7196 = ~You are not here to think! Leave the thinking to your betters!~
@7197 = ~Now just calm down and we'll straighten this all out.~
@7198 = ~Well, the side you have chosen to support is now quite obvious, I think. I would have preferred a peaceful solution, but if this is the way it must be, I do appreciate being on the winning side.~
@7199 = ~Regardless, this matter is resolved. We will try to bring our lives back to some semblance of normality. We will also try to resolve what guilt we feel for what we did during this incident.~
@7200 = ~You have returned, though not quite as I expected. I must say that your visit to the Metrich Barony has yielded some surprising results.~
@7201 = ~There was evidence of that, but my duty was to the task I was sent to achieve.~
@7202 = ~I... knew of no such evidence. The squatters were quite clearly belligerent.~
@7203 = ~Such a crime is unforgivable! I will lead an army down the throats of those responsible!~
@7204 = ~You will go to a safe-house we have set up, and you will make sure she remains secure. It is as secret as we could make it, though nothing is ever absolute.~
@7205 = ~It... it is true, I can sense it!  Oh, by the mercy of the Gods... you must use the artifact to destroy the beholder!  You must!~
@7206 = ~You... must retrieve the second half of the rod.  It was split apart long ago, by the gods... in order to keep the world safe from its power.~
@7207 = ~I will tell you how to gain the second half... if you agree to use it to destroy the beholder.  The device cannot be taken from here, lest its curse strike you down.~
@7208 = ~You... you have killed the creature who has enslaved so many.  Of that, I am thankful.  But... I see you still hold the rod... the rift device... yet unused.~ [SASSAR09]
@7209 = ~Be warned, my <LADYLORD>... the device cannot be taken above the ground.  My findings here have taught me that.  It will surely destroy you if you do...~
@7210 = ~You have destroyed the creature who has enslaved so many... and for that, I am more grateful than I can say.~ [SASSAR10]
@7211 = ~I sense you have the rift device... the rod.  You have used it?  I must caution you not to take it to the lands above... its power would consume you.~
@7212 = ~You have freed our brother!  For that, I would lay roses at thy feet, my <LADYLORD>!  But... there is still the matter of the... ah... gem, is there not?~
@7213 = ~I thank you, my <LADYLORD>... you have done much for us all.~
@7214 = ~Our poor sparrow lies broken.  All is darkness, now, for us all... regardless of what occurs...~
@7215 = ~Ahhh... our brother is dead.  Poor Haer'Dalis, truly he had little in the way of luck.  Leave us be, Prime... we must mourn for our fallen comrade...~
@7216 = ~He... he's free, is he?  That's good... Raelis says I still have a long time before I am ready to be a full actor.  But I don't mind... it's my dream and I'll work hard!~
@7217 = ~Raelis has asked me to come along and join the troupe!  Imagine that... me, a Prime, traveling the planes!  And acting!  Truly acting!!~
@7218 = ~Haer'Dalis is dead... that means... that means I have to continue acting.  Ooooh, I feel ill...~
@7219 = ~There's a tanner, Rejiek Hidesman, who has his shop near here... he might have some tannin, I'm not sure.  Might be worth it to ask him.~
@7220 = ~Halt! This place is under the protection of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. You will leave immediately or suffer the consequences!~
@7221 = ~Halt! You will go no further while I am... Oh, forgive my outburst, <CHARNAME>. I was told you were coming to relieve me but I have been getting rather edgy. It has been a long day.~
@7222 = ~I have... planned this for... too long only to have my plans shattered by some inbred, northern adventurers!  I... I just wanted to be respected...~ [KALAH12]
@7223 = ~This... this is Aegisfield, all right.  (sigh)  It is too bad... he was a fine and just man.  Here... give his body to me.~
@7224 = ~Your story seems odd... but I can tell if someone's lying.  I will check your story... but for now you have the city's thanks for the service you have done us.~
@7225 = ~It is good the tanner is dead... though I would have liked to speak to him first. No matter. I trust this reward will compensate you... thank you again, citizens.~
@7226 = ~I have solved the murders that were occurring in the bridge district... but the murderer killed Inspector Aegisfield.  I have his body with me, here.~
@7227 = ~I have solved the murders that were occurring in the Bridge District... but the murderer killed Inspector Aegisfield.~
@7228 = ~Oh... by the gods, that IS the Inspector!  Quickly, my good <LADYLORD>, bring the body to Chief Inspector Brega immediately!~
@7229 = ~Oh... oh, my.  I think you should speak to Chief Inspector Brega, however... he is here in this building, and I think he should know of this immediately!~
@7230 = ~Damn and done, this crypt looks to be well looted already! The rank, stinking bastards beat us here! Those scoundrels'll dine on me sup of cold steel 'afore I'm through with 'em!~
@7231 = ~Nalia... no offense, but you are not poor; your children will not starve.  You empathize, but you may be blinded by the romance of saving the impoverished.~
@7232 = ~Surely such a thing would not be allowed if I were following the wrong path?  This shall be my rebirth... after I rest for a bit.~
@7233 = ~I will decide what course is best. I have already seen to your cage.~
@7234 = ~Let us just say that he is less than pleased by the loudness of your voice and the fact that you are currently standing on his cache of nuts.~
@7235 = ~And to answer your question, yes... we do care.~
@7236 = ~Many would still starve in the wood though surrounded by food.  We must tell of the wonder, but also of what she requires.~
@7237 = ~Urrr... you... you <PRO_RACE> no attack?~
@7238 = ~We... we go, now.  We no work for fat human.  Gurgh be sick... me go get him better, now.~
@7239 = ~Greetings to you, my <LADYLORD>.  I am afraid that I am waiting for another at the moment... perhaps some other time?~
@7240 = ~Because of you, we have lost the greatest social coup this city has yet seen!  Sir Sarles is gone before we could show him off! Get out of here!~
@7241 = ~You have my apologies. I tried to please him, but to no avail.~
@7242 = ~And I curse you for trying! How could guttertrash such as yourself hope to please a man of his caliber? Get out, and leave me be!~
@7243 = ~Here... I'll mark the location on your map.  We should head there immediately.  Be careful not to be spotted.  I hope everything is all right!~
@7244 = ~Well... I've been thinking, and I'm pretty sure they would have left someone alive.  Daleson... he would be tending the stable.  You should try to reach him.~
@7245 = ~Then I wish you luck finding it. I will go on my own.~
@7246 = ~We've no more time for your morbid fascinations. Let's get moving.~
@7247 = ~What are you doing here, you drunken lout?!  I thought you were well-enough banned from this place!~ [LOUTCA01]
@7248 = ~Aye, then... I shall go.  But the gem I mentioned still needs taking from Mekrath's lair.  I shall await your arrival at the playhouse beneath the Five Flagons Inn... bring the gem there, I beg of you.~ [HAERDA94]
@7249 = ~I have heard of your activities. Your disservice to the faithful means I must tell you that any task we may have asked of you is now null and void.~
@7250 = ~Your service is no longer required here. Such as you are not worthy of serving in the name of Helm. All church tasks you have been involved in are considered finished.~ [TELWYN08]
@7251 = ~Ah, but it is not merely that. You shall understand, I am sure. I formally transfer responsibility for the situation to you, <CHARNAME>. May Helm watch over you in this.~
@7252 = ~Franco, what was that... oh, he has been relieved. Good, I found his manner insulting. Be a dear and fetch me some ale.~
@7253 = ~He shall not be disappointed with my service. She will be safe.~
@7254 = ~I will see to his needs as an ambassador of the Order..~
@7255 = ~Stuffy old paladins are all alike. Same as father, and my uptight godparent, Hurgis. I am not looking forward to living with him. Stupid 'champions of morality.'~
@7256 = ~All you people got my 'best interests' at heart, but I don't want to be a symbol... I just want to get on with my life!  Whatever. Stay doggie. Guard. Heel.~
@7257 = ~It's bad enough I have to suffer those paladins without their hired help bugging me too. Go back to guarding, doggie.~
@7258 = ~Stow it, bucket-helm.~
@7259 = ~You are no longer required.  There's torches outside... my godparent is here. As bad as living with him will be, it's better than this!~
@7260 = ~Your friend... our former ranger... is no longer welcome here, I can assure you.  I think it would be best if you all left.~
@7261 = ~I... despite all you have done for us, you are no longer worthy of being the village's ranger.  I find it very... very sad, what you have done.  You should be ashamed of yourself, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@7262 = ~In an instant, for you.  Quick, boy, stand alert... we gots our best guests present an' in the house!~
@7263 = ~Aww... yer not gonna make me work, are ye?~
@7264 = ~Well, if it ain't our own ranger an' protector, like!  Pleased am I t' see ye, me <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>!  Things have... been going well, I assume?~
@7265 = ~Right.  Like ye didn't knows about 'em orogs... or whatever they were.  They would o' liked this inn, I'm sure of that!~
@7266 = ~Killed yer precious Umar, too.  Hehehe... an here you were screamin' like a banshee, sure as sin that she'd come back, now, t' kill ye!~
@7267 = ~When did Merella ever save us?  'Sides from those orcs that time.  An' that black wolf feller.  An'... oh, mind yer business, boy!  May I help ye, me <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@7268 = ~Well, they wouldn't 'ave been welcome, I assure ye.  They would have eaten ye, boy... yer gettin' mighty portly.  Er... something I can get ye, me <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@7269 = ~Ye'll be minding yer tongue, boy, lest somethin' other than th' witch decides to part ye from it!  Ah... er... somethin' I can get for ye, me <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@7270 = ~Ah... it is ye, me <PRO_LADYLORD>.  Is there... does ye wish to rent a room... perhaps?~
@7271 = ~I see.  Um... as ye wish...~
@7272 = ~Some... somethin's got t' be done!  Somethin' does!  She's comin' t' kill us all!  Oooh, I knew this would happen!  I shouldn't have stayed here!!~
@7273 = ~Relax, there, Vinny... she ain't gonna come an' kill ye personally just 'cause yer selling those books.~
@7274 = ~Yes... yes... that's right... she won't come just after me.  Er... did you... did you wish somethin', me <LADYLORD>?~
@7275 = ~What can you tell me about this Umar... do you know anything specific?  Weaknesses?  Magical powers?~
@7276 = ~Oh... ah... certainly!  Right away!~
@7277 = ~Well... ah... there is... there is certain legends that say that... ah...~
@7278 = ~It HAS been over seven centuries since she existed in the valley, me <LADYLORD>!  The legends... they don't even agree on what she looks like!~
@7279 = ~As... as you wish... oooh... maybe I should think about settin' up a caravan now.  How long t' Athkatla?  ... hmmm...~
@7280 = ~Greetings to you, my <LADYLORD>... I must tell you how grateful I am that you saved us all from those awful... shadows... or whatever they were.~
@7281 = ~I suppose I was wrong about that... that Madulf fellow... and those other creatures, as well.  They saved Atta from those ogrons!  And... and so did you, as well, of course!~
@7282 = ~And... and now you've saved us from that person who pretended to be Umar, of all things.  You truly are a marvel!~
@7283 = ~Good day, my <LADYLORD>.  I... I don't care what other people say... you saved us all, once, no matter what your friend did.  You have my blessing.~
@7284 = ~Greetings to you, ranger.  I hope you find yourself warmly welcome in our village... especially after all you have done for us.~
@7285 = ~Something has to be done about that... that witch, Umar!  She's threatened to kill us all unless we leave... we cannot abandon our village!  Please, you must do something about her!~
@7286 = ~There are a bunch of... of creatures trying to attack the village, my <LADYLORD>... but that ogre, Madulf, has been holding them off!  Please protect us, please!!~
@7287 = ~There are a bunch of... of creatures threatening to attack the village!  That... that ogre has held them off... or tried to eat them, I don't know!  Oh, help us, please!!~
@7288 = ~Yer friend is no longer deservin' of the position he had... wouldn't it be best if ye all just left, now?  Imnesvale is not such a place fer folks like you an' that ranger.~
@7289 = ~Mighty pleased t' see ye, ranger... hope yer findin' our village to yer likin'.  We all appreciate havin' someone like you t' replace Merella, an' all.  Such a tragic thing, her dyin'.~
@7290 = ~Greetings to ye, ranger.  Might I say we're mighty pleased to have a fine <PRO_MANWOMAN> like yerself helpin' us all.  Ye've proven yerself... I hope the gods continue t' smile on ye, truly.~
@7291 = ~That foul witch, Umar... or whoever it might be... has cast her shadow over us all.  It's up to you... an yer friends... t' save us all.  Go an' speak to the Minister, if ye haven't already.~
@7292 = ~I wouldn'a believed it if I hadn't seen it myself... that ogre's lived up to his word and saved us all from the initial attack.  It's up t' you, though, now... ye has to go to the cave near here and save him.~
@7293 = ~I can't believe it... that ogre an' his creatures... they went an' protected us from those ogrons come from th' hills.  But now they're in trouble... you plannin' on helpin' him out o' this trouble?~
@7294 = ~Ogrons have come down from th' hills an' are plannin' to attack us... you must help the village, ranger!  Go, quickly!~
@7295 = ~There are a group of those... those creatures preparing to attack the village!  The herders say they are near the caves!  Oh, you must help us, please!!~
@7296 = ~Maybe ye all should just go... an' take yer former ranger friend, there, with ye.  Our village... we'll find our way just fine without the likes o' <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@7297 = ~Yer doin' a fine job, there, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... Merella would o' been proud, in fact.  Is there anythin' yer needin' help with?~
@7298 = ~You know quite a bit about the area's history, Nelleck... what can you tell me about it?~
@7299 = ~Not much, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... that noble came an' didn't even talk to the Minister.  Just marched on over there with 'is men, easy as ye please.~
@7300 = ~There was lots o' relics and such left from th' days when mithril was mined in th' hills... but most of it's long gone.  I don't think he'll find none.~
@7301 = ~'At don't mean he won't disturb the forest, or burn it down while he's goin' about 'is business.  Tsk... a real shame.  Me pa said that area's all holy ground.~
@7302 = ~None.  Like I've said before... Madulf an 'em are pretty quiet an' keep t' themselves, mostly.  I don't think they wants any trouble.~
@7303 = ~Better than ye'd think, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  Madulf and a couple o' others have been in an' out a few times... buyin' food an' usin' the inn.~
@7304 = ~Folks were scared at first, but they've been real polite.  Keepin' a low profile, too... as low as 'em big 'uns can get, anyway.  The merchants like it, anyhow.~
@7305 = ~Nay.  They're long gone... an' good riddance.  Got what they came for, didn't they?  Heh...~
@7306 = ~Nay... no one's come.  Nasty bugger wasn't liked much even by them other nobles, I guess.  The sacred ground will stay as it is, more or less undisturbed.~
@7307 = ~Aye.  Even Johanna went an' thanked Madulf, personally.  And now Imnesvale's got defenders like no one else.  Who'd 'ave thought, aye, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@7308 = ~Aye.  No one expected Madulf and his followers t' actually help anyone.  They been by t' trade things, an' such... real polite.  People are mighty thankful.~
@7309 = ~Nay, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  No sightings.  Been a long time since them orcs attacked... an' I think they'll think twice, now, 'fore they try it again.~
@7310 = ~Aye, things have been going very well an' smoothly, like.  We're all mighty grateful to have ye here, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger.~
@7311 = ~Well... the village has been here for centuries, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Even during Umar's rule... although it was a darker place, then, an' mostly just farms an' such.~
@7312 = ~There was a rush a few centuries back... found mithril in th' hills.  Temples and such were built all o'er the place, then abandoned when the mines ran dry.~
@7313 = ~As ye wish, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... anythin' ye wish, I'll always be glad t' help ye.~
@7314 = ~Despite all ye've done fer us, yer no longer welcome here, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  Yer type... well, maybe ye'd better just be on yer way.~
@7315 = ~There's ogrons come from the hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs with ogre blood in 'em.  They're gathered near the cave north o' the river, plannin' to attack the village.~
@7316 = ~There's ogrons come from th' hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs mixed with ogre blood.  That ogre, Madulf, an' his followers... they've been fightin' them for the village.~
@7317 = ~Madulf's given us some time, but the ogrons have him holed up in the cave north o' the river.  He needs help... talk to the Minister, if ye haven't already.~
@7318 = ~There's ogrons come from th' hills, my <LADYLORD> ranger... orcs mixed with ogre blood.  Madulf an' his followers, they've kept their word and fought against 'em.~
@7319 = ~They've bought us some time... but the ogrons cornered 'em in a cave north o' the river.  They need help.  Best go an' see the Minister, if ye haven't already.~
@7320 = ~My <LADYLORD>!  The... the witch, Umar, has returned an' warns us all to leave 'fore she murders us all!  I can hardly believe it t' be true!~
@7321 = ~The Minister has asked for ye... go an' speak to him, if ye haven't already.  He knows where the witch to be... ye must protect us, my <LADYLORD>!~
@7322 = ~Ahhh... good day to you, then.  Is there something that you need?~
@7323 = ~(sigh)  Well... ye are the local ranger, here.  Very well, I'll keep me brusqueness to meself, if it offends ye.  Now... did ye want t' buy somethin' or nay?~
@7324 = ~As ye wish, then.  But you'll get no discount, here... I nay be givin' me shelves o' goods away.~
@7325 = ~Is there... is there something that you need?~
@7326 = ~Actually... this is a matter I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>.  No offense...~
@7327 = ~Actually... the matter of the ogrons is something I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>.  No offense...~
@7328 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... I trust you have already been approached by the forest spirit?  I am afraid there is little that I can do.~
@7329 = ~That is good... I am very relieved.  Lord Igen is currently in the same area as those... that Shadow Lord was, earlier.  I suggest you go quickly.~
@7330 = ~That is... a little more than I expected, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  But, I suppose you are correct... Lord Igen must be stopped, no matter what occurs.~
@7331 = ~Go swiftly, then, and be safe... Lord Igen is in the land that the Shadow Lord was, until recently... to the west.~
@7332 = ~Very well... I will keep my word.  This time.~
@7333 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... please forgive me.~
@7334 = ~As... as you say, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  The Lord Igen is in the lands to the west of here... in the area once occupied by that Shadow Lord.  Be... be careful.~
@7335 = ~Then... then you are unworthy to be the ranger of our village!  By Mielikki, I've never seen a ranger of your sort!  How you are not Fallen is beyond me!~
@7336 = ~The ogron band is collected outside of the cave... on the north shore of the river.  I beg of you, <CHARNAME>... please deal with this menace!~
@7337 = ~... he is trapped in a cave with one of our shepherd boys, Atta, who wandered into the area.  Madulf scooped the boy up and took refuge in the cave.~
@7338 = ~The boy must be saved, <CHARNAME>... and Madulf must not die in vain!  Please... deal with this menace, I beg you!  Or we will all be forced to flee our village!~
@7339 = ~... the fighting has driven him back into a cave.  Rescue him, <CHARNAME>, and deal with this menace... or the whole village must flee for our lives!~
@7340 = ~Yes he is, but this is too convenient for my tastes. Something could be wrong.~
@7341 = ~I have no desire to fight ogrons... deal with this yourselves.~
@7342 = ~Very well, Minister... I will do what I can.~
@7343 = ~No, I killed the bastard. This was too easy, so I figured he was lying.~
@7344 = ~But... but, <CHARNAME>!  You are our ranger!  You... you must help us out, we are in desperate need!~
@7345 = ~Very well... I'll see what I can do.~
@7346 = ~The village would be grateful, <CHARNAME>... go, then... the cave is on the north shore of the river.  I... I do not know how many ogrons there are... good luck.~
@7347 = ~I am most relieved!  Go, <CHARNAME>... the cave is on the north shore of the river!  I do not know how many ogrons there are, but I wish you well.~
@7348 = ~Very well, Minister... I will help, if I can.~
@7349 = ~But... but <CHARNAME>, there is a boy whose life is in danger!  And you are a ranger, are you not?  How can you abandon us like this?~
@7350 = ~(sigh)  Very well, then... I'll see what I can do.~
@7351 = ~I... I do not believe he can, <CHARNAME>.  Please... a boy is in danger, and the ogre must not die for helping us.  You are a ranger... will you not aid us?~
@7352 = ~Very well... I will help, if I can.~
@7353 = ~But the ogre is in danger, <CHARNAME>... and he fought valiantly to aid us!  You... you are a ranger?  Have you less honor than an ogre?  Will you not help us?~
@7354 = ~Very well, Minister... I will see what I can do.~
@7355 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... I apologize.  I will help, if I can.~
@7356 = ~The cave is on the north side of the river, <CHARNAME>, not far to the northwest of here... you will find the ogrons there.  Go quickly!~
@7357 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are in dire straits.  Umar, or someone claiming to be her, has returned.  She came several days ago, ordering all the villagers to leave at once.~
@7358 = ~What? That was your solution? You had better hope you are right, because if you aren't, you are going to be in sooo much trouble.~
@7359 = ~Everyone was so frightened... this Umar then shouted with a great, booming voice, saying she was reclaiming her land and that we were trespassers...~
@7360 = ~She has given us only a few days, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  A few days to leave forever, or she will kill us.  You... you will help us, yes?~
@7361 = ~(sigh)  I wonder how long I'll have to live like this?  Well... all the assassins are dead, now, no matter what you've done.  I know how they work.  You should probably go back to the Order and report this... I'd rather be alone.~
@7362 = ~I'll do what I can... where can this supposed 'Umar' be found?~
@7363 = ~But you are a ranger, <CHARNAME>... you are our protector.  How can you abandon us now?  We cannot fight a force such as this!~
@7364 = ~A... a reward?  Did you become a ranger to become rich, <CHARNAME>?  You have a duty!  Will abandon us now, and leave us to face this witch?~
@7365 = ~I suppose you're right... I'll see what I can do.  Where is this 'Umar'?~
@7366 = ~Of course not... I'm sorry, Minister.  Where can I find this sorceress?~
@7367 = ~Shepherds followed her to the lands in the west.  She... went into the dungeon where you found the Shadow Lord.  That is where you should start.~
@7368 = ~I am grateful for your aid, <CHARNAME>... I trust the gods will look out for you... and Imnesvale... once again.~
@7369 = ~Sure, sure.  My father was certain, too, that his enemies wouldn't stoop to this.  Well, whatever.  I know how these assassins work... they're not coming back.  Go back to the Order and report whatever you have to.  I will be fine.~
@7370 = ~Are you certain you have no proof of your identity?~
@7371 = ~I will go and get her directly. Forgive my obstinate nature, but I had to be sure.~
@7372 = ~You, there... you are the <PRO_RACE> who has become the ranger for this place?  My name is Mairyn... I am a spirit of this forest, and I am in desperate need of your aid!~
@7373 = ~There are... other humans... in my sacred lands to the north of this place where the temple of the sun god once stood.  They have come recently,  digging and tearing down the trees...~
@7374 = ~I have begged them to stop, good ranger... I have pleaded with them that they are destroying not only I, but many of the other forest spirits as well.  The humans have refused.~
@7375 = ~I implore you... go to the forest in the north and do whatever you can to stop these humans from further desecrating my forest!~
@7376 = ~And we are baffled as to how you could have made such a mistake! You have killed one of the most respected servants of Torm in the realms!~
@7377 = ~What has happened. <CHARNAME>? I am told that the child is dead and that an imposter of Hurgis Baltezan was also found killed.~
@7378 = ~Very well, Mairyn... I will do what I can to help.~
@7379 = ~No interest?  You are a ranger, are you not?  You are a defender of the wild... and I am in desperate need of your assistance.  Will you turn your back on me, ranger?~
@7380 = ~You are right... I will help you, if I can.~
@7381 = ~I know not who these humans are... they claim, however, to be searching for something.  Something I do not know the location of.  They... threatened me, ranger.  I was forced to flee.~
@7382 = ~Very well... I will go and help you, if I can.~
@7383 = ~Reward?  You are the first ranger I have heard of who has desired something in compensation for his duty.  I... I have nothing to offer you, ranger, other than my gratitude.~
@7384 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do.~
@7385 = ~I will tell them of their mistake... and I will deal with the humans in the west as best I can.  Go, unworthy ranger... go and be a simple warrior or mercenary, if you must.  The forest needs not one such as you.~
@7386 = ~I... I sense that the humans yet continue their desecration of my sacred forest.  What is it, good ranger?  Is there a problem?~
@7387 = ~I have agreed to find what the noble, Lord Igen, was looking for... but I cannot seem to find it.~
@7388 = ~There is no problem, Mairyn... I will continue trying.~
@7389 = ~Yes, there is.  I cannot make the Lord stop his search... I can do nothing more to help you.~
@7390 = ~Yes, there is.  I have changed my mind... I do not have the time to help you.~
@7391 = ~But how is this possible? You said he would arrive!~
@7392 = ~But you must find a way to stop him, ranger... you must!  He cannot continue his actions!  He gives no thought to the consequence of what he does!~
@7393 = ~I will not harm him, Mairyn... and I cannot help you.~
@7394 = ~Very well... I will keep on trying.~
@7395 = ~He seeks a cache of mithril hidden by an ancestor... but he has only half of the directions to where it lays.~
@7396 = ~I do not know where this human might find this mithril.  I truly do not.  I might suggest that you look to the human temple beneath the ground... the place where you, yourself, banished the shadows.~
@7397 = ~Perhaps you might find what you seek there... I cannot say, for certain.~
@7398 = ~Mielikki bless you, good ranger... I will continue to wait here.~
@7399 = ~Very well... I will try again.~
@7400 = ~I already sense that the violation of my forest has ceased, good ranger.  I... I am sorry that it had to come to violence.  You have protected your charge, nevertheless, and I am grateful.~
@7401 = ~I will return to my home, now, and thank Mielikki that one who is true to her service has taken up a station here... that justice is upheld in this woodland.  Bless you, good ranger.~
@7402 = ~You successfully detected the evil they were trying to perpetrate, and for that you have earned the respect of your peers and the community.~
@7403 = ~Good ranger... it is I, Mairyn, and once again I must ask you for help.  The witch who has threatened your village... her dark and foul magics have also begun to poison the woodland!  You must do something!~
@7404 = ~Very well... I will seek her out and stop her.~
@7405 = ~Yes, I already know of her... I will do what I can, Mairyn.~
@7406 = ~You do not know?  A witch has come into the area very recently... a human witch... and she has threatened your village with her magic.  Either they leave... or she will kill them.~
@7407 = ~Already she gathers her dark powers in the buried human temple... that place where you destroyed the Shadow Lord.  Her magic seeps into the earth and poisons it with evil.~
@7408 = ~Yes, as I said... I have more important things to do.~
@7409 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do.  But I must go to Imnesvale, first.~
@7410 = ~She lies below, good ranger, and the need is most urgent... but if you must go to your village, first, then do so quickly.  I will wait here for you.~
@7411 = ~I sense that the sorceress is dead... the foul presences she has conjured have ceased.  You have done well, good ranger.~
@7412 = ~You have served the natural order with honor and strength, good ranger.  I... I have something to give you.  It is a present from Mielikki, a most rare thing...~
@7413 = ~... an idol of the Moon Dog to help when you struggle.  Take it, <PRO_RACE>, and be thankful that a goddess smiles upon you.~
@7414 = ~Oh!  There you are, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger!  I... I've been looking all over the place for you!  You... you've got to come to Imnesvale!~
@7415 = ~There's orcs... big ones!  Nelleck says he saw them coming down from the hills. Soon they'll attack!  The Minister sent me to find you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!~
@7416 = ~Tell them to find someone else to deal with it... it's not my problem.~
@7417 = ~But... but you're a ranger!  You're the protector that replaced Merella, aren't you?  You've got to come!  We've got nobody else to turn to!~
@7418 = ~Oh, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!  Please!  Everyone's so scared that they're going to have to flee the village!  I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~
@7419 = ~Madulf... he said he would do what he can, but Nelleck says there's too many!  Oh, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!  Please!  I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~
@7420 = ~Nelleck says that they'll be at the village soon... no later than three or four days from now.  You've got to hurry!~
@7421 = ~What... what could be more important than this?!  Oooh... Nelleck says that the orcs will be on us within four days at the most... maybe less...~
@7422 = ~... I... I'll go an' tell Minister Lloyd that you may not be coming.  I do so hope you change your mind, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!  I was sure you would help us...~
@7423 = ~If you... if you change your mind... please hurry...~
@7424 = ~I... I thought rangers were good people... that they protected people.  I... I can't believe you won't help us anymore...~
@7425 = ~Orcs... big ones... are comin' down from the hills.  Nelleck saw 'em, and the Minister sent me to find you.  They'll be at the village in four days... maybe less!~
@7426 = ~Madulf says he'll help, but Nelleck says there's too many... even for him and those other creatures of his.  The Minister says you should come quickly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@7427 = ~We haven't got anyone t' turn to, except you.  And... and you replaced Merella, right?  You'll come, then, right?~
@7428 = ~I... I've found you again, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!  It's... it's always so hard to find you, sometimes!  The... the village is in danger again!  The Minister has asked for you!~
@7429 = ~It's Umar!  The witch!  She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now!  The... the Minister says he will tell you everything!~
@7430 = ~Don't have time?  But... but you helped us fight those orcs... and you saved us all before that.  Why... why would you abandon us now?  I thought you were a ranger...~
@7431 = ~Perhaps you are right... what is happening in the village?~
@7432 = ~I... I can't believe you won't help us.  If you... if you change your mind, please come and help!  I don't think we can fight this...~
@7433 = ~Well, what you're doing is destroying the forest... you have to stop.~
@7434 = ~Very well, then... off you go, peasant.~
@7435 = ~I am warning you... your life is forfeit if you continue this desecration.~
@7436 = ~You're not going to continue what you're doing... I'm here to see to that.~
@7437 = ~Hmmmn.  I might, at that.  It would certainly save me a great deal of trouble... and spare me the danger of facing the monsters, here.  Are you serious about this, woods<PRO_MANWOMAN>?~
@7438 = ~No... I doubt you would keep your deal, anyway.  It would be far better to kill you now.~
@7439 = ~I am willing to put off the search... at least for a while, to give you time to look for it.  I'm sure my men will be glad of the break, at any rate... and it really costs me nothing.~
@7440 = ~You are a ranger, aren't you?  I should have guessed from the attitude and the clothing.  Very well, then, ranger.  I will leave here forever, if you find what I am looking for.  You have my word.~
@7441 = ~He was not alone, back then.  Many nobles came... and there was not enough for all, certainly.  I had always assumed that Idras had found nothing, but his journal suggests otherwise.~
@7442 = ~The part of the journal I have only mentions this area in general... nothing specific.  Hence the large search I have undertaken.  Here... I have a copy that was printed out.  You may need it.~
@7443 = ~The other half of his journal may be around here... I certainly couldn't say where it might be, though, and I'm not about to waste effort looking for it.~
@7444 = ~So... there you have it, ranger.  My men will set up camp, here, and we will give you some time to search.  It means little to me, but for your sake I wish you well.~
@7445 = ~... I see.  So this medallion is the sum of all he found?  The fool!    Ahhh, then this whole expedition has been a waste.  It cannot be that valuable that all this effort has been worth it.~
@7446 = ~Very well... a thousand gold and your departure is enough for me.~
@7447 = ~I would prefer to hang onto it, actually... it might be worth more than you say.~
@7448 = ~I suppose I do not need your coin... it is yours by right, as you say.  Take it and leave, then.~
@7449 = ~Sorry... two thousand or you don't get it.~
@7450 = ~Do not test my patience, peasant.  It is mine by right, and I will not be trifled with.  I will give you five hundred gold... and do not presume to bargain with me further.~
@7451 = ~Perhaps you are right.  Five hundred it is... so long as you leave, as well.~
@7452 = ~Aye.  I am a man of my word, ranger.  I have found what I desired... such as it is... and I shall go.  Come, men... we are returning to the city.~
@7453 = ~You are generous, then.  I see the rangers are as noble as their reputation.  Very well, then... I am also a man of my word.  Come, men... we return to the city.~
@7454 = ~I warn you, peasant.  That is my property... and I shall use force, if necessary, to take it from you.  I offer five hundred gold... accept or face the consequences.~
@7455 = ~I've no desire for trouble... five hundred it is.~
@7456 = ~Never mind, Lord Igen... I've no need for your coin.  It's yours, as you said.  Take it and go.~
@7457 = ~Hmmmn... a commoner <MANWOMAN>.  Away with you... I doubt we have any business, the two of us.~
@7458 = ~That's too bad... you will not continue this desecration so long as I am here.~
@7459 = ~Nothing... I'll be on my way.~
@7460 = ~I found this medallion, along with a note from Idras.  Apparently, he didn't have much luck... he used all his mithril to make this.~
@7461 = ~I haven't... but I have found the other half of Idras' journal, here.  Will you accept that, instead?~
@7462 = ~No... and I have decided not to continue looking.~
@7463 = ~It doesn't matter... I doubt you can be trusted, anyway.  It is better to kill you now.~
@7464 = ~Certainly not.  I do not know where you got those writings, ranger... they might not even be authentic.  And even if they are... use them to find the cache yourself.~
@7465 = ~After all... it is you who is so concerned about my men leaving tracks in your precious landscape, not I.~
@7466 = ~Oh all right, but then we have to get going. It isn't safe here.~
@7467 = ~Forget it, then... I am not about to continue this fool's errand.~
@7468 = ~I have my doubts as to whether you would even keep your word... forget your task, noble.  Killing you is the only option.~
@7469 = ~As you wish.  You can look no better than I, I suppose... I shall continue to bide my time, here.  I'll even keep my men off the grass.~
@7470 = ~I think they let us stay because Gorion had powerful friends.  I wish he had said where I was before that, but he thought it wasn't important, so I didn't worry too much.~
@7471 = ~That is not good enough.  You know too much about what I look for.  In fact... you could already have found the cache and intend to keep it for yourself.  Continue the search... or face the consequence.~
@7472 = ~Very well... I'll keep looking.~
@7473 = ~Do so... and return once you have it.  And do not force me to come looking for you, either, peasant...~
@7474 = ~We left when Sarevok killed Gorion.  I was sorry I couldn't help, but we got him in the end. Remember that?  That Sarevok turned out to be a child of Bhaal, like you?~
@7475 = ~I am no one you need to concern yourself with, traveler.  I am here to ensure the safety of Lord Igen, and that is all.~
@7476 = ~You have agreed to undertake Lord Igen's search for him?  Then you are foolish, indeed.  He will not stray from his quarry... and I doubt you have the ability to complete the task.~
@7477 = ~Don't mind the break, here, at all.  You all just watch yourselves... any funny business with Lord Tombelthen and that'll be the end of you.~
@7478 = ~You'se must kill the ogrons, <RACE>!  Li'l human must be protected!  Go an' kill ogrons... Madulf wounded.  Madulf stay and protect li'l human...~
@7479 = ~You'se must kill ogrons!  Madulf try, but Madulf wounded... Madulf hold off ogrons from here.  Go, <RACE>... kill ogrons!  Protect human village!!~
@7480 = ~Ogrons dead?  You'se done good, <RACE>.  You'se kill all 'em ogrons good... Madulf try, but Madulf's friends get hurt and run.  Then li'l human came, and Madulf had to protect li'l human.~
@7481 = ~Madulf pick up li'l human and run for cave.  Ogrons shoot arrows... hurt Madulf.  You'se okay, though, li'l human?  You'se not hurt?~
@7482 = ~I... my name's Atta... and I'm fine, mister Ogre, sir...~
@7483 = ~... Okay... um, thank you, mister Ogre...~
@7484 = ~Madulf say he protect village, so he try kill ogrons.  Ogrons very strong, though.  Madulf kept word, though... Madulf hold ogrons back so ogrons no attack too soon.  You'se get here just in time.~
@7485 = ~Madulf go, now... Madulf must find his friends, see if friends dead or wounded, maybe.  Madulf see, now, if humans in village be nicer to Madulf and friends.~
@7486 = ~You'se a good <RACE>... Madulf thanks you for saving Madulf.~
@7487 = ~Madulf knows Madulf never promise to protect village... but Madulf not watch village humans be hurt.  Madulf and friends... we hold ogrons back.  You'se get here just in time.~
@7488 = ~Ogrons dead?  You'se done good, <RACE>.  You'se kill all 'em ogrons good... Madulf try, but Madulf's friends get hurt and run into hills.~
@7489 = ~Madulf fight ogrons on own, but ogrons shoots arrows... arrows hurt Madulf, so Madulf run for cave.~
@7490 = ~Are... are all those bad monsters gone, <SIRMAAM>?  I... I'm so scared...~
@7491 = ~Thank you again, <CHARNAME>... the gods have smiled on us, indeed, to allow us you as our ranger.~
@7492 = ~Well... this changes my mind about him, and I hope others in the village will feel the same.  We are blessed, truly, to have him... and you... as our protectors.~
@7493 = ~We had to call the Knights of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart to help... but they arrived too late to save many.  You could have done much to prevent it.~

@7500 = ~Dolorous Decay (Alteration, Necromancy)
Sphere: Combat, Necromantic
Level: 6
Range: 10 yards
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects a single living creature.  Dolorous decay is a rotting and withering of the body that spreads throughout the afflicted creature quickly.  The target creature will automatically be slowed for two rounds.  Furthermore, if the target fails the saving throw vs. poison at -2, each second it receives 1 point of damage, until a total of 50 hit-points of damage are inflicted.~
@7501 = ~Zone of Sweet Air (Abjuration) 
Sphere: Wards
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors (including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill).  This spell will dismiss all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in.  The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon).~
@7502 = ~Alarm 

(Abjuration, Evocation)


Range: 10 yds.'Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hrs. + ' hr./level'Casting Time: 1 rd.
Area of Effect: Up to 20-ft. cube'Saving Throw: None

When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat--anything larger than about 1 cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-foot radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.
~
@7503 = ~Melf's Minute Meteors (Evocation, Alteration)
Level: 3
Range: 70 yds
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 target/meteor
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the wizard to cast small globes of fire (one for each experience level she has attained), each of which bursts into a 1-foot-diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4 points of damage to the creature struck. It can also ignite combustible materials (even solid planks). The meteors are treated as missiles hurled by the wizard with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls and with no penalty for range. Each meteor inflicts +3 damage, and an additional +3 fire damage, and has a +6 enchantment. The wizard may discharge up to five missiles per round.

When this spell is cast, the meteors are conjured by the casting and appear in the wizard's quick-weapon slot. An enemy can then be targeted with them as a weapon and the wizard will hurl them to the target.~
@7504 = ~Wizard Eye (Divination, Alteration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to 60 feet away in brightly lit areas. The wizard eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a detect invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye.  The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful dispel cast on the wizard or eye ends the spell.~
@7505 = ~Limited Wish 
(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 7
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The limited wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a limited wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost by the wizard.  Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.  Lastly, the wiser the wizard, the better chance that he will choose the right wording.  Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
@7506 = ~I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures.~
@7507 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

@7589 = ~Yer plannin' on usin' the courses, maybe?  Huntin' someone in the crawl or tryin' out the rafters?  Watch out fer the trap room, though... the guildmaster there is a bit o' a sadist, if ye asks me.~

@7593 = ~I'm sure yer wondering just what Mitsu is doing amongst the Shadow Thieves.  They don't have many halflings here, right?  Well, that's true... but not many halflings take their thievery so seriously.~
@7594 = ~Me, I do.  And the fact that I can pass fer a human child... a helpless, cute human child... gives me the edge when I want to rob a mark.~
@7595 = ~All I have t' do is bat me eyes, see?  And I make a moue and say, "Please, sir... I can't find my way home?  Can you help me?"  Ha!  Works like a charm!~
@7596 = ~Heh... of course I shall, if ye wish.  I jus' can't help starin' at the wee curves of yer leather, is all.  Stirs the heart, it does.~
@7597 = ~Ya know... I was just in the graveyard district the other day, leanin' against a tombstone an' counting coins from a mark I'd hit in the promenade, right?~
@7598 = ~An' this nobleman walks up to me... I'm in me little girl dress, mind... an' he asks if I'm lost.  So I goes with it, cryin' and shiverin' and actin' all helpless, like.~

@7602 = ~Aye... I suppose nothing that occurs in the guild is any of my business.  At least, not any longer.  Not once Aran got through with me.~
@7603 = ~I am Achon... I was once Aran's lieutenant, his chief assistant and right-hand man.  I was loyal to the guild above all, and that was my greatest fault.  I thought I was doing the guild a favor by trying to assassinate Aran.~
@7604 = ~Perhaps I was right, perhaps I was wrong.  Perhaps Aran will not destroy our guild.  Perhaps the other guild run by that... that woman... will be eliminated.  I suppose I shall never know.~
@7605 = ~'Twould be a relief, I think.  Aran's had me here for over a month.  At least... I think it's been a month.  I'd hate to think I'd just be left here to rot, forever...~
@7606 = ~Aran sent me to sneak into a fort in Murann... bring someone who was there back out.  I was the best, and he told me the mission was important.  Just... just not how important, though.~

@7608 = ~You see... the one I was sent to retrieve was Aran's nephew.  They had him prisoner there.  And... and he was executed the next morning, by the time I stumbled back to the guild.~
@7609 = ~It's so... so cold down here.  And the other prisoners are bleaker than a dark pit in the Abyss.  I just... I just wish Aran would take pity on me and have it over with.~
@7610 = ~You'd best be careful not to cross Aran, if you ever work for him.  The Shadow Thieves are deadly assassins... and they're completely at his beck and call.~
@7611 = ~There's that other guild, now, isn't there?  One run by some woman.  I wonder... I wonder if she would get me out of here.  I'd work for her, for sure... and I bet there's others that would be willing too, as well.~
@7612 = ~But who am I kidding?  There's no hope for me... or any of us, here.  Just... go away, whoever you are.~

@7635 = ~Combat between men, is it?  Such a practice is vile, <CHARNAME>... surely we will not stand idly and allow such practices to continue?~
@7636 = ~They watch people fight each other, here?  For pleasure?  Why would they do that?  Those men... they don't do that willingly, do they?~
@7637 = ~Ah, I see.  We've interrupted something, I see.  Hmmmn... why, aren't you Lord Havrelock?  I believe I've seen you somewhere... with Lady Havrelock, I do believe...~
@7638 = ~Ah!  Er... no, no, no... that's not me... or him... or... er...~
@7639 = ~<CHARNAME>!  Don't be so cruel... he... he is just a little human boy!  What has he done that you should treat him so?~
@7640 = ~A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield.  Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield.  Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from 3'-4' in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings.  A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward. This is a magical shield.

I'll have to tell you about it, sometime.~

@7708 = ~Hmph.  Well, the pay best be bloody well worth it, if I'm to be wandering through the wilderness, hacking away at bears and squirrels and other such beasties.~
@7709 = ~You will not, Korgan.  There is a disturbance in nature that we are to restore... I will not have you swinging about, heedless of the consequences.~

@7713 = ~This ancient tome creaks as you open it.  Each page of the Book of Infinite Spells contains a spell described in layman's terms, easy enough for a thief, a cleric or even a fighter to understand and cast it.  Each spell on a page can be cast once per day.
A second function of the book is to turn to a different page of the book.  This allows for the possibility of getting a better spell.  However, once the page has been turned the previous spell is lost forever, unless it happens to appear again.

Be warned.  Once you turn to the last page of the book, you are stuck with that spell.

The spell on this page is:

Stinking Cloud (Evocation) 
Level: 2
Range: 30 yards 
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2 
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special 

When a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be reeling and fall down for 1-2 rounds.  Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round.  A dispel magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud then they are still subject to its effects.~

Burning Hands (Alteration) 
Level: 1
Range: 5 feet 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 60 degree arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of about 60 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage.~
@7715 = ~Dwarven Thrower, War Hammer +3,
This hammer -- not to be confused with the elven made Dwarf Thrower -- is only usable by dwarves.  In the capable hands of a dwarven warrior the hammer may be thrown at an opponent.  The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder.  If it hits an opponent it does double the normal damage that a hammer would normally do.  Against giants and ogres the hammer does an additional +8 damage, due to the special hatred that dwarves hold against these races.

@7716 = ~Hammer of Thunderbolts

A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items; a girdle of giant strength and gauntlets of ogre power.  His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area.  Unfortunately Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items and before they could be gifted to him.  In grief Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets.  Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts he went to battle against the giant folk.  He died valiantly.
Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon but when merged with the gauntlets of ogre power and a girdle of giant strength the hammer is transformed.  This transformation requires magical assistance.  The Hammer of Thunderbolts is then capable of doing an additional +8 damage as well as instantly killing any giant or ogre that it strikes.

@7717 = ~Ilbratha, Short Sword +1

This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and was apparently forged for Azoun the First, a long dead king of Cormyr.  It saw little use, and eventually found its way to a favored of the king's guards.  Despite the aid of its illusionary magic, that unnamed soldier fell in a later battle, and the sword was lost to brigands or scavengers.

One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge.  Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge.  Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

@7722 = ~Long Sword +2: Ras, The Dancing Blade
Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure.  He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village.  Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage.  The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade.  Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless, and wielded the sword for many years.  How they were ultimately separated is not known.

This blade belonged to Dabbar, a long dead servant of Bhaal that exercised control over his minions in the most brutal of ways.  In addition to strengthening the mind against the guile of others, the sword absorbs life energy from an opponent with each successful hit, healing the user.  Dabbar considered it a failure of his officers if he returned from battle in less than perfect health, and as the rest of the company watched, he would administer beatings until fully healed.

Also known as Neversleep, this ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerun's history.  Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details.  It is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

Dungeon-delving Lehorgan was lucky indeed to discover this Halruaan blade in the ruins of the ancient sorcerer Kullon's haunt, for it would save his life that very day.  The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand.  Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location and again the sword protected him.  Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring."

@7727 = ~Jhor the Bleeder, Bastard Sword +2
This blade belonged to Ho Mang, a traveler from Kara-Tur who accepted dubious service at court throughout Faerun.  Skilled in "persuasion", he would use this sword to perform the "Death Of A Thousand Cuts", an ancient ritual from his homeland involving a lengthy series of small, painful incisions.  The properties of the blade prevent blood from clotting, and the victim slowly bleeds to death.  The sword was stolen, and its whereabouts have been a mystery until now.

@7732 = ~Katana +1
To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

@7734 = ~Wakizashi +1
The wakizashi, or companion sword, is extremely important to the samurai.  It is worn at all times, even indoors, and is near the samurai when he sleeps at night.  Wu Jen masters have concealed within this wakizashi great power, unleashed only when the wielder is in the thick of battle.  How or why this wakizashi made it to Faerun is unknown, but if the samurai who owned it still lives, he will certainly be looking for it.

The sword of the ninja, the ninja-to, is of lower quality than other Kara-Tur blades such as the katana.  The ninja-to is short with a straight blade, making it ideal for the subterfuge of the ninja.  The ninja-to is also more suited to fighting in closed places, sometimes giving the ninja an advantage over the longer blades that the samurai used.

They were part of his personal collection, ninja-to that he either 'collected' from rivals or designed himself.  When he died, his mistress gave away the swords to her other lovers, all of them powerful thieves in their own right.

@7737 = ~Scimitar +1, Shazzellim 
This scimitar is of rather poor quality but beneath its surface lies great power and evil.  Created for the sole purpose of slaying Harpers, Shazzellim is more than capable of that task.  With one strike of the blade a bard must make a saving throw vs. spells or die.  Crafted by a Red Wizard of Thay, the sword also has the ability to vocalize, which is why it was often given to fighter-mages in the service of the Wizards.  Needless to say, possession of this sword would not be looked upon very highly by Harpers.

@7738 = ~Two Handed Sword +3: Harbinger
When the hero Trueblood destroyed the Harbinger, a demon gorging itself on the blood of peasant folk near Luskan, he bound its essence in the only vessel capable of holding it, his fabled sword, Deliverance.  Though the evil creature was dominated by the will of the semi-sentient blade, it was not truly defeated, and it transformed the weapon from within.  Now it acts much like any other enchanted weapon, but when it strikes, there is a small chance that a fireball erupts, a sign that the demon within still rages at its imprisonment.  There is also a chance that any ogre it hits will be turned to stone.  Whether this is an ability of the demon or a vestigial power of the original blade is not known.

A social faux pas placed upstart Andor Licon in a duel with Baron Eeirk, heir to a warrior king.  Though they seemed of even skill, Andor grew oddly weaker with each hit of the Baron's family blade.  Panicking, he bade his bodyguards kill Eeirk.  Despite his claims of morality, some noted that the young noble had positioned his men before the duel was even underway, and though he professed disdain for its dark magic, Andor made a tidy fortune off the sale of the evil blade.

@7741 = ~The Holy Avenger: Carsomyr
Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle.

The title does not refer to the blade itself, but rather to the woman who originally wielded it in the icy hinterlands of Faerun.  Her name was Carerra, and she was a veritable firestorm that swept across arctic trolls and the northern orcish tribes.  She was a hated enemy of many a shaman whose magic often floundered against her fury. After a lifetime of raucous battle, it was old age that eventually claimed her.  The sword was passed to her granddaughter, an adventurer, who presumably brought it to Amn.

Ardulia met his match one spring morn however, when he battled the priest Itgan, who wielded this mace.  Ardulia seemed to stagger under each blow, slowing his pace to recoup and regain his breath.  Without his speed, Ardulia was lost, and fell to the measured attacks of Itgan.

Bearpaw could draw back the bow without the slightest effort, but when he died it was bequeathed to his wife and sons, and not a one could draw the string even halfway.  They eventually sold it to a merchant heading South.

This yew bow is more a work of art than a weapon of war; fine engravings dance over the polished wood, and the bowstring gleams of gold, almost singing when drawn.  This was a ceremonial bow in the Elven Court for a thousand years, though that is scarcely a single lifetime in elven terms.  Every 50 years or so it was granted to someone who had performed a great service, the recipient eventually choosing who would hold it next.  Two centuries ago a human, Yin Pon, rescued an elven prince and was gifted the bow, which he carried with him to Baldur's Gate, where it was subsequently lost.

The thin, frayed string of this bow appears unusable, but when it is drawn a solid but invisible arrow becomes tangible.  The lich Tansheron gave this bow to his Watcher, the guardian of his keep who stood atop a tower with neither entrance nor exit.  When anyone approached, down would fall a never-ending rain of phantom arrows until they were dead or fled.  How this bow was wrested from the Watcher's hand is not known, but would probably make a great tavern story.

None know better than Halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe.  This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure.  Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect.  It would seem that Halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.

If this weapon had a lofty beginning, it has been overshadowed by the exploits of its most famous owner, Hangard the dwarf.  Hangard made a habit of trying to knock melons and apples off the heads of comrades.  He missed more often than not, due in part to an unfortunate fondness for ale.

@7776 = ~Rifthome Axe
This Axe of Hurling is one of the most heavily enchanted weapons of its type.  Its markings are vaguely dwarven, but no dwarf yet encountered on Faerun has claimed a kinship with the maker.  This causes some to speculate that it may not be the product of a terrestrial dwarven hand, rather some extra-planar variant.  Dwarves laugh this off, of course, claiming the maker likely has no time for nosey scholars.

@7777 = ~Azuredge Axe +3
Gulen Rockfire, Slayer of Undead, crafted this powerful throwing axe expressly for reinforcing his claim to his namesake.  Blessed by a cross-section of gods, this weapon does phenomenal damage against creatures unwisely rebelling against their deceased status, and can potentially destroy them in a single blow.  Obviously Gulen no longer carries Azuredge, and it is rumored that he died fighting a powerful vampire years ago, only to rise as one himself.  This may have softened his stance regarding the undead, at the very least prompting a change of name.

The Stonefires were an old lineage of dwarves, and the eldest male of the line carried this axe, an heirloom of utmost importance.  Unfortunately they were decimated in 1150DR, falling in a mere two years to a mysterious plague.  Ulgan, keeper of the axe, fled in the hopes of escaping the inevitable, but he died several weeks later.  His body was found in the Cloakwood Forest, but the axe was missing.

This was the axe of Illgarth, a Frost Giant that terrorized northern communities long ago.  It is not known where he acquired the weapon, but he took a perverse pleasure in unleashing it upon small folk, particularly halflings.  Ice and acid maimed those not killed, and the giant would laugh coldly if he recognized his handiwork from a previous visit.  Ultimately a group did manage to kill him, and at the request of his victims Frostreaver was buried with him.

Fullen Woolspinner, an ambitious halfling from a well to do family, left his home to spend several years adventuring.  During his travels he ended up staying with a family of dwarven weaponsmiths.  Much impressed by their throwing axes, which always returned to the hands of their wielder, Fullen sought to make a dagger that could do the same.  With the help of his dwarven friends he succeeded, creating several of the famous Fullen Boomerang daggers.

Upon striking an opponent the Pixie Prick releases a surge of powerful magic, potentially inducing a deep slumber.

This was the weapon of Thorvin Dukal, one of seven self-proclaimed Dragonslayers who spent years railing against what they called "an insidious dragon infestation that threatened Faerun."  Thorvin had this weapon enchanted at great expense and used it on many occasions, though of dragons only a single white has fallen to it.  The Dragonslayers met their match in a cantankerous ancient red who slew the entire group in an epic battle.  This weapon did not end up in the beast's hoard however, as the creature returned to its lair to recuperate and when it emerged the field of combat was well scavenged.

@7785 = ~Halberd +4, Dragon's Breath
Trying to profit from the strength of greater beings, many years ago the mage Ullion founded a dragon-worshipping cult under the moniker "Son of Drago."  Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold.  When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold.  Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor who sought to rule.  There was no real power to be had without the mage, so the entire organization soon collapsed on itself.

This was the weapon of Dominique Harl, a sightless paladin who frequently traveled Faerun.  When attacked, Dominique would unleash the black mist that is this halberd's namesake, potentially blinding all within ten feet.  This often gave him the advantage, for he lived in darkness all his life, seeing only with the inner light of faith.  Dominique eventually fell, his body found in a dark forest, slain by a creature of the night even more at home in the shadows than he.

The creature was eventually erased from existence, purportedly by another of its kind, but such close proximity to that concentrated evil has imbued this blade with the very essence of night and the chill of darkness, energy that becomes deadly in combat.  It is a foul weapon, and a warrior should use it with caution.

Rushing forward in hopes of ending his influence, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

The stone giant father bartered with a local wizard for this girdle, which made Stewart as strong as his brothers and sisters.  When Stewart met an untimely end, the girdle was stolen away.

The origin of this item is tied to a melancholy ode popular in human taverns, about a young elven boy lost in a great wood.

Area of Effect: 30-foot radius 
Saving Throw: 1/2 

A sunfire is like a fireball -- an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it - 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 15d6). The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster.  Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface.  The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area to make a save vs. death or die.  Creatures with more than 60 current hit points are immune to this effect.~

@8003 = ~No, no, I don't think he is villainous enough for that. No, he is merely morally repugnant, not criminal. At least to my knowledge.~
@8004 = ~It is my right as heir to choose who shall lead. I do not know if I could stand before the Roenalls, but you, with your... erh... talents, would prove a daunting figure.~
@8005 = ~They will complain, but there is no real cause why you could not do this. Often a fighting soul will take possession of a keep when the lord is... is dead.~
@8006 = ~Just your strength of... er... character. Often a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN> will take possession of a keep once the lord is... dead. It is a matter of the heirs declaring it.~
@8007 = ~As well you should, and it is a natural progression. It is not uncommon for a fighting soul to take possession of a keep when the lord is... is dead.~
@8008 = ~Please, this will benefit us both! You will gains status and my home will be safe. Often a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN> will take possession of a keep when the lord... is dead.~
@8009 = ~But... very well then. I will remain here to do what must be done. This is exactly what the Roenalls want. I hope you're happy with the misery you leave behind.~
@8010 = ~Have you given any more thought to my offer? Time is short and... I do not know how long I can stall the Roenalls.~ [NALIA67]
@8011 = ~Ehh... I'm afraid I have very little to say to you.  I trust that you're enjoying your time at the keep?~ [KPDOMO07]
@8012 = ~I need coins, quickly... I would like to raise some taxes.~
@8013 = ~Incensed at your decisions, a crowd of angry peasants has stormed the gates of the keep, let in by mutinous guardsmen that also thought you abused your power as ruler of the land and manor.
As cries of rage traveled the halls you were forced to reluctantly escape through a side passage... even with your skills, a crowd of both peasants and guardsmen could not have been held off for long.

By the time you left the keep, the gentlefolk of the land had taken control of the building... likely waiting for knights from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart or even a new lord to come from nearby.  Either way, rule of the de'Arnise Keep has been stripped from you... permanently.~
@8014 = ~I don't think it's a major problem, <CHARNAME>... just don't do it too often, is all I would suggest.~
@8015 = ~I've heard that the people are quite upset.  I wouldn't tax them any more, <CHARNAME>... you don't want them to revolt, do you?  Father always treated them fairly.~
@8016 = ~You can't tax them any more!  The people are near revolt already, and well they should be, considering what you've been doing here!~
@8017 = ~Wha... what happened... I remember getting hurt and... and then I fell over... where...~
@8018 = ~*COUGH*  Wha... what happened... I remember getting hurt and... and then I fell over... where...~
@8019 = ~I... I was dead... wasn't I. That was definitely not a pleasant experience. Was I gone long?~
@8020 = ~Not much has changed. I have kept the same forms that Lord de'Arnise wished, arranged minor matters of justice, but... that is merely here at the keep.~
@8021 = ~I am one of your maids, Chanelle, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  I... I can't believe all the terrible things they're saying about you.  After you freed us all from the trolls... it just isn't fair!~
@8022 = ~Oh... hello, Mistress Nalia.  I... I just want to say that I am terribly sorry about your father.  I, too, shall miss him terribly.  He... he was like a father to me...~
@8023 = ~Hullo to you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.  I am Talira, one of the new maids here in your keep.  I have heard nothing but good word of you... a good thing, as my last employer was a terrible, terrible man.~
@8024 = ~If you are here at her request then you might at least mean well, though we shall see if you actually accomplish anything. Miss Nalia is a caring noble, but she is still a noble by any measure.~
@8025 = ~I don't know. I seen a few make a break for it, but they were killed as they ran.  Maybe a few are hidden here or there.  I know Lord de'Arnise is still alive, at least he was this morning.~
@8026 = ~She means well... a little too well. Thinks she's gotta help all of us 'peasants.'  She sneaks out now and then and skulks around our taverns and such, as if it makes her 'understand' us.~
@8027 = ~If you do see Miss Nalia, let her tag along.  She knows this place better than anyone, or at least thinks she does. One's as good as the other sometimes, and it's better than going blind.~
@8028 = ~Good day to you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.  You remember your stable boy, Daleson?  Glad t' see you carryin' on after Lord de'Arnise... an' not them Roenall folks.~
@8029 = ~Hullo, Nalia.  Good t' see you're in good health an' all.  You done well for Lord de'Arnise, you have... hopefully this <CHARNAME> rules as good as your father did.~
@8030 = ~Nalia... don't you think this has gone on far enough?  <CHARNAME> ain't no <PRO_LADYLORD> t' follow yer father.  Almost rather'd see a Roenall here than that sort.  Think about it, girl.~
@8031 = ~I... I won't stand for this!  This is far worse than if the Roenalls had taken over the keep!  I won't let you take my family's land and run it into the ground!~ [NALIA79]
@8032 = ~You can't just kill someone!  You think you have that right because you run the keep?!  What kind of monster ARE you?!  Well... I won't stand for it!!~ [NALIA80]
@8033 = ~I had to feed 'em, and nothing gets between them and their food.  Abandoned their post for the dog stew I made.  Had to kill four dogs per meal.  Disgusting!~
@8034 = ~They guard the main room of the dungeon, but they feed in one of the cells... to the south down the hall, in the back of the room where they first broke in.~
@8035 = ~Just wanted to warn you about them. They almost killed me and all I was doing was dropping their food in the cell. Nothing keeps them from their food.~
@8036 = ~I suggest you calm yourself, Mister Bendelia... and perhaps start by explaining to <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME> exactly what sort of outrage you are referring to.~
@8037 = ~Why else would I want it, huh?  I'm Missy... the coat check girl!  And I'm the best damn coat check girl that Aran's ever had!  Nothing stolen here, I watch them coats like a HAWK!~
@8038 = ~All the trainees around here... they slink around like they think I can't see 'em.  They try to steal things out of the coats, try to steal the coats themselves!  But that only works once on ME, boy!~
@8039 = ~Oh, so now this is a HAMSTER check room?!  Why I oughta...~
@8040 = ~All the other coat checkers were all envious of Cousin Jowen's tips.  They used to harass him and try to steal his coats and get him into trouble.  Cousin Jowen was too smart for them, though.  You know what it takes to brew turnips properly?  A good, solid mind, that's what.  And some very strong rabbits, too, but that's neither here nor there.  In fact --~
@8041 = ~What?!  Are you bothering me AGAIN?!  If you don't have a coat, don't hang around here!  Or... or maybe you're scoping out my coats, huh?  You think you're gonna steal 'em?  You think so, huh?!  Well, FORGET IT!!~
@8042 = ~Hmm... as I said, he cannot be easily ignored. Many will be upset if their farms are foreclosed, and the bandits will have to be dealt with sooner or later.~
@8043 = ~I know a few reliable mercenary companies we could acquire for 500 gold. That would handle this problem. Mm... we could go as low as 250, but that would take longer.~
@8044 = ~Well... if that is what you wish to do, I suppose I might be convinced.  But their debts are worth around a thousand gold... the same as was the worth of my caravan.  So it makes little difference.~
@8045 = ~No!  That is a loss of money for something that you have no right to!  Either pay the thousand gold for the debts or recompense me for my caravan.  Pfaw!  Is it so difficult to understand?!~
@8046 = ~I'll compensate you for the caravan, then.  But I will only pay half: five hundred gold.~
@8047 = ~He is your subject, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, so yours is the right to decide punishment, but you are also... being watched carefully by those who oppose your rule, however.~
@8048 = ~Well... if you accept him, the family chapel in the lower level is unacceptable, but... the small chapel on the floor above us would serve. It is up to you.~
@8049 = ~Hahhr!  Now 'at's what I likes to hear.  I'm beginning to like this place, truly enough.  But if I gets too much under your skin, you just lets me know.~
@8050 = ~It is good you have come, <PRO_LADYLORD>!  Lord Farthington Roenall himself has arrived to speak with you. He has been... agitated... by the wait, and does not seem pleased.~
@8051 = ~But he did... leave word with me. He does not recognize your claim to the keep... or Mistress Nalia's ability to give it. He said he would return... with an army.~
@8052 = ~Captain Cernick said he would do all he could to build your forces, but there is little else that can be done. Lord Roenall may be bluffing, but I am... not sure.~
@8053 = ~Nalia is too young to decide for herself to just give the land away.  And the very idea is preposterous at the least!  So... I'm going to be a gentleman and give you the choice to decide your fate for yourself.~
@8054 = ~This scroll contains a brief confession written by Quataris. You can use this confession to have Haer'Dalis cleared. The scroll reads like this:


"I, Quataris, do hereby swear that I have, with Malice and Forethought, framed one Haer'Dalis for the Theft of a certain Bust of Sune. I obtained the services of one Janos to steal the Bust for me. In doing so, he took the Appearance of Haer'Dalis and, without my knowledge or consent, most foully Murdered the Owner of the Bust, the gentleman Acton Balthis. I swear the Events within this Letter to be True and Clear."

The scroll is signed in the cramped quill-work of Quataris.~
@8055 = ~I am unsure if you have met Chanelle... she has been a maid here most of her life. She was an orphan, and the de'Arnise family took her in as a servant when she was young.~
@8056 = ~This is a long staff made of thick, sturdy oak.  It is crawling with a strange, black radiance and feels quite warm and tingly to the touch.  Small runes of arcane origin have been carved in various places at both ends.

@8057 = ~This chunk of alloy was created for you by Jerlia the Ore Merchant. You hope that it will do in the stead of real ore which is nearly impossible to obtain. Jerlia assures you that Sir Sarles will not tell the difference. As to the alloy itself, it has an... interesting shape that looks vaguely like something though you can't put your finger on what that something might be.~
@8058 = ~Preposterous!  There is no such debt!  I would know of it!~
@8059 = ~... Hmmmn...~
@8060 = ~This journal seems to be that of an apprentice mage, telling the tale of her expedition into the Umar Hills with two other apprentices in the search for evidence of the fabled witch.  The tale is hard to believe, but seems to relate the group's horror at getting lost and being hounded by an unseen predator during the nights.  The script is in a panicky, feminine hand and the last page can barely be made out as follows:

"... sorry to Joshellus' mother. I'm sorry about what happened to Michaelus. There's something out here with us. We thought it to be peasants but peasants aren't this clever. Joshellus says it's the witch.  I hear her when I sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want to sleep. I don't want..."

The journal ends here.~
@8061 = ~I will pay the full 1,000. I won't have people being hurt because some crooks tried to take advantage of me.~
@8062 = ~You are more than generous... Very sensible of you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, not to invite further blackmail.  I will make the arrangements immediately.~
@8063 = ~There has been a terrible flood on your (pant!) on your land!  There's so much devastation!  The major domo asks that you come to the keep (pant!) ... as quickly as possible!~
@8064 = ~My son was killed!  The water came so quickly... it was all we could do to get away with our lives!~
@8065 = ~The dikes are... almost as costly, hence the reason Lord de'Arnise kept putting them off.  2,000 gold to rebuild them, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... a harsh expense, I know...~
@8066 = ~As... you wish, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. It can wait another year if necessary, but I do not think it good to wait longer than that. Lord de'Arnise already put it off too long.~
@8067 = ~The tome is a mishmash of ideas, sketches and scribbles. One section on Iron Golem Creation draws your eye:

"I am sick to the stomach with traveling the planes! Nearly every place I stop I manage to pick up some dangerous passenger that dents my guardian here when he goes to throw them out. Don't these demons and their ilk realize that iron golems are tedious to maintain? Regardless, he's nearly fixed now. If I can only remember where I've placed the arm and the head. I haven't really been feeling like myself lately. It's probably nothing.

Note to self: once the other two golem parts are found, REMEMBER to START the FURNACE. Get some damned coal! Recall the unfortunate week spent dodging the baalor whilst agonizing over why the cursed activation machine wouldn't run!"

The tome continues for a few more pages although the writing makes less and less sense. Lavok seems to have been going mad.~
@8068 = ~Our forces are fewer, and they are all newly recruited... we cannot hope to win! Oh, they will be on us in no time... Lord Roenall will take this keep by force!~
@8069 = ~I have seen Firkraag; do not risk yourself for my sake. Find a way to get the key from the mage and we shall flee this place.~
@8070 = ~The forces of Lord Roenall have been routed, thanks to your efforts, your grace.  Once again, the keep and surrounding lands have been saved by your hand.~ [KPDOMO11]
@8071 = ~We all wish to express our gratitude... and let you know that we would desire nothing more than for you to remain our ruling <PRO_LADYLORD> for as long as you desire to.~
@8072 = ~This keep is not your property!  The Amnish Council has taken it over and will assign it to the proper nobility.  You are unwelcome here... begone at once!~
@8073 = ~You. I had thought you would be taller.~ [TEOSXX02]
@8074 = ~I am here as a contact and a master, and I will thank you for keeping your tone civil. I am Teos, and I have been assigned to offer you... a special deal.~ [TEOSXX06]
@8075 = ~Magic is all but banned in the city, making many into outlaws. Why would you offer anything?~
@8076 = ~I'm listening.~
@8077 = ~I will inquire to my superiors about her if you wish. Until then, I would advise that you act in accordance with this agreement.~
@8078 = ~If you display magic in the streets unlicensed you will be censured accordingly. The lives of a few brethren are apparently an acceptable price for your assistance.~
@8079 = ~I will go along with this for the moment.~
@8080 = ~I bring three young mages. They have shown potential, and have been removed from their homes that they might be cultivated into productive Cowled Wizards.~
@8081 = ~I'm sure. Next is Larz. He found some old magic texts and studied without his parents' knowledge. They feared the stigma he would bring and cast him out.~
@8082 = ~I will serve as best I can, <CHARNAME>.~
@8083 = ~Here! Here is the fight! I regret that I cannot join the fray, as I must report to the Order the enemy's numbers and tactics! Even if all my friends should fall, someone must live to report of this.~
@8084 = ~Keep close by my side. The Baron would prefer it if you did not speak to any of the squatters before the meeting. He fears your view of him would be... tainted.~
@8085 = ~Hold! I warn you, I have killed many of your brethren to get this... oh, forgive my manner. I feared you were another grouping of orcs come to harass me.~
@8086 = ~We'll have to find my aunt's bedroom. There's a secret passage within that leads to the cellar entrance.  Down there is probably where the leader is.~ [NALIA82]
@8087 = ~Uh, yeah, that's why I'm here. Yeah. The Tomb.~
@8088 = ~Ho, friends!  I heard much commotion and have come down to investigate.   What transpires, here?~
@8089 = ~A fellow's been in the inn for the past couple of days.  Meeting with Raelis, I think... a director of some note, as I was told.  He was at the bar last night, mentioning he was between projects.~
@8090 = ~Hmm... I was approached by a Lord Jierdan Firkraag.  He seemed to suggest that I would need his approval if I was to make it through here.~
@8091 = ~I haven't had much trouble though. There were a few orcs, but they seemed to be afraid of this area.~
@8092 = ~... but we needn't get into that.  Goodman Thunderburp has told me your situation, and I would be pleased to offer my service as director of this fine concern!~
@8093 = ~Historically speaking, yes. I am an academic, not some cutesy well-bosomed relic hunter. You may be able to help me. Care to talk about a partnership of sorts?~
@8094 = ~Oh all right, I'll help.~
@8095 = ~So you did manage to stumble your way into victory. Expect no reward beyond what you've undoubtedly stolen from my home. The sooner you're away from here, the better.~ [DELCIA07]
@8096 = ~Blast. I hoped to get you to do the grunt-work. I'll do it, but not with you at my back. You'd leave me dead and take whatever I found...  that's what I was planning.~
@8097 = ~Akae! The plan did not work! Strike now!~
@8098 = ~Oh no, you'll not threaten me. Think you'll get me to do the work and then take what I earn? No <SIRMAAM>. I won't fall for my own plan.~
@8099 = ~What? Blast, why did I waste my time of this idiotic plan. Did you hear that, Akae! Your stupid plan has failed! We'll be doing it ourselves, just as I thought!~
@8100 = ~Sorry to crush any illusions you had about this academic adventure, but I'm more concerned with how much I can sell these little trinkets for.~
@8101 = ~Eh?  Excuse me... I'm trying to get into character!  Can't you see that?!~
@8102 = ~'Tis a grand thing to have the Council anoint the playhouse so.  And an even greater honor to be a part of the troupe that done it.  This will be a great place someday... a fine, honorable theater.~
@8103 = ~Grr... I am a guardian.  Many the Drow did fall in the cleansing, but red came a Wing to their call and their aid.~
@8104 = ~I didn't know they ever kept a steady playhouse in Athkatla.  People here... aren't the real theater-going type.  Can't show off your wealth enough, I guess...~
@8105 = ~The path past the fire leads to rest well deserved, the path past the fire is clear to his eyes.~
@8106 = ~What! You are no more a hero than those blasted monsters! What has become of this land!?~
@8107 = ~Yes, yes, enough with the chatter.~
@8108 = ~He's always been like that. Won't even hunt if he's having a bad fur day.~
@8109 = ~Do you see? Do you see how our enemies fall? Obey your new guild, <CHARNAME>, and it will not be necessary for you to join the thieves in death. Obey, and you shall benefit Mistress Bodhi, and yourself.~
@8110 = ~Higgold!  Do not mention its name!  Call it 'the Turmish play' if you must.  It is a masterpiece of theater, but the curse is real and you should heed it!~
@8111 = ~Remember this battle. Remember that the Shadow Thieves protect their friends, and exact painful penance from their rival guilds, no matter how strong or guarded.~
@8112 = ~At minimum, a bare-bones production, we can get by on 1,000 gold pieces.  Of course extra would make the play that much more presentable.~
@8113 = ~I am not willing to put in 1,000 gp, Higgold.~
@8114 = ~I do not have 1,000 gp to put into this, Higgold...~
@8115 = ~Very well.  I suppose 1,000 gp is good enough... but I am willing to part with no more.~
@8116 = ~I can afford to put in a bit more than 1,000 gp, I suppose.~
@8117 = ~I suppose I could afford more than 1,000 gp.~
@8118 = ~Actually, perhaps 1,000 gp is enough, after all.~
@8119 = ~I can afford 2,000 gp.~
@8120 = ~I can afford 3,000 gp.~
@8121 = ~I will put in 4,000 gp, Higgold.~
@8122 = ~I will put in 5,000 gp, Higgold.~
@8123 = ~10,000 gp, no more.~
@8124 = ~The ruins to the east of the den have long been a place of foreboding to my pack and I.  We had no desire to tread the ground of the fallen temple.~
@8125 = ~The temple was once dedicated to Amaunator, a god of the sun, and a great prophetess is buried within. It was holy ground once, though now it is fouled.~
@8126 = ~Rumors and hearsay. I am here before you as the proverbial horse's mouth. You may take what I say at my word, or you will end like all the others will.~
@8127 = ~Some weeks ago, muted rumblings were heard beneath the temple. We paid little heed to them until the skies darkened and the shadows deepened.~
@8128 = ~Once they were all dead his darkness reached out to the corpses of my children and animated them as shade wolves.  Numb with terror and sorrow, I ran.~
@8129 = ~Hmph!  Women!  Anyway, the situation has been resolved.  All is proceeding normally, except perhaps for some hurt feelings.  Nothing new to the theater, though.~
@8130 = ~A problem has arisen, I fear. Strange noises and things going missing, <CHARNAME>.  The actors are spooked... they think it's the curse.~ [BDHIGG10]
@8131 = ~The play is coming along rather well, my patron.  The dress rehearsal is tomorrow, once we clean up this mess.  Best you go get some rest and let me take care of this.~ [BDHIGG11]
@8132 = ~A coincidence.  And my style is my own; do not be so petty.  Perhaps if you were a better actress you would not worry so.~
@8133 = ~Be quiet, fool! We... we don't want to alarm this... wait a minute.~
@8134 = ~I know you! You are <CHARNAME>, or at least part of <PRO_HISHER> group. I don't think I met <PRO_HIMHER> in person, but I heard what happened. Joined with that other guild, <PRO_HESHE> did.~
@8135 = ~I guess we don't have to worry about you turning us in to the Shadow Thieves. Hey, if you can give us a good word in the new guild we would appreciate it.~
@8136 = ~Better pick the right side when it comes time to choose. I know I am. Good luck to you.~
@8137 = ~Yeah... Aw heck, <HESHE>'s not buying it, I just know it. I guess we make our choice now then!~
@8138 = ~Ahh, <CHARNAME>, creature of shadow, or at least, Shadow Thieves. A pity you had not made a different decision when the time came to choose. A pity your taste in guilds was not different.~
@8139 = ~Mere stories, told to frighten you into staying with a dying organization. Why would they fear competition? Because they are weak.~
@8140 = ~Yes, I currently work for the Shadow Thieves.~
@8141 = ~Then you are to renounce your guild and join with us, or you will die! Is that... wait... I know you. You are <CHARNAME>, and you serve the Mistress.~
@8142 = ~Then flee this place. Our hunt continues, and if we do not find what we wish we may take it out upon those that stand by. Wait, I know you.~
@8143 = ~This is one of three flail heads belonging to Lord de'Arnise.  Not all three heads are required to assemble the flail.~

@8150 = ~Very well. Might I ask if there is anything in particular you would want us concentrating on?~
@8151 = ~You! I sense the stench of Talos upon you! I warn you, I am here to purge this place of the evil that has been claiming innocents, and if you are involved I will see you dead!~
@8152 = ~If that be your wish.  Your cleric can be tryin' to match th' power of de oldest one, Shvanana is sure.  Shvanana was asked to come, she did not be comin' here on her own.~
@8153 = ~Shar will not dispel the despair of these actors.  There is no curse here, no magic.  But I would be pleased to go through the motions for you if it eases the cries of these frail rivvin.~
@8154 = ~My daughter? You mean young Nalia? She is my niece. Her mother passed when Nalia was but two seasons. Caught some pestilence from those peasants she so loved to coddle.~
@8155 = ~Oh well, those that beg cannot afford to be choosy. At least, that is the phrase as I have heard it. Shall we get to the business of a rescue? I assume that is what you are here for.~
@8156 = ~I fear your attempt at eloquence masks a simple mind. No doubt you refer to Nalia, my niece. She might seek your company... that is my constant fear.~
@8157 = ~Such manners only serve to illustrate what I already knew by the smell of you. You are filthy peasantry, come to ingratiate yourselves by rescuing your betters.~
@8158 = ~Please keep quiet?! Such insolence could only come from a lout of the lower classes. Who let you in here? A silly question on my part, I suppose.~

@8160 = ~Your role is to rescue such as I, and to be thankful for the opportunity. Or do you intend to save only those that fit your ideal? I was not aware that heroes were allowed to be so choosy.~
@8161 = ~And if you would, Lord de'Arnise is still at the mercy of the beasts below. He is Nalia's father, and I believe they are trying to get him to reveal something about a cache of gold.~
@8162 = ~Of course they did, and that is their duty. Am I to extend extra gratitude for a task that should be relished? It is their lot to serve, and it is my lot to remain above them and be served.~
@8163 = ~Uh... freedom from his domination... thank y...

(The ranger's words trail off. She is dead.)~
@8164 = ~Through tomes and other clues, my party learned of a perverted altar of Amaunator which can only be reached through the bowels of this place.~

@8167 = ~The typical throwing dagger has a pointed, usually double-edged blade, as opposed to a knife, which has a single edge and is a bit shorter than the dagger.  Unlike a dagger, this one has a smaller handle and is balanced perfectly.  A thin coating of poison has been applied to each poisoned throwing dagger, making it a lethal tool in the hands of trained assassins.

@8170 = ~You do not understand, my dear.  I have watched centuries... ages... unfold.  You are but a passing flame, soon extinguished... and one day just a name.~
@8171 = ~Grow up, Ketrick!  This is the theater... it never goes quite how you'd expect it to and you can NEVER prepare enough.~
@8172 = ~Ahhhh!  Patron, patron!  <pant!>  I found you!  <pant!>  Master Higgold... he says... come quick!  Quick!  It's... <pant!> ... some opening night emergency!  <pant!>~
@8173 = ~I... ah, you... you are married, my master?!~
@8174 = ~Little useless trinket enchantment.~
@8175 = ~Stop it! We have to start somewhere. <CHARNAME>, if you would direct us in what our next assignment should be then we can begin.~
@8176 = ~Stow it, Nara. I say we try our hand at making wands of death! ZeeOWWW!! That'll show 'em.~
@8177 = ~Is that before or after you fix the hole you burned in Teos' roof?~
@8178 = ~Or maybe a little basic levitation?~
@8179 = ~QUIET DOWN! *ahem* I'm sorry Nara, but I think Larz is right.~
@8180 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>, we won't bother you again.~
@8181 = ~There's a little something I like to call 'The Wand of the Apprenti!'   When used it randomly shoots fire, ice, or lightning. Very nasty. Materials will cost 1,000 gold.~
@8182 = ~Very good, though I would prefer something a little more practical still. A ring of Protection is a standard test in this discipline. It is... a little risky though. What say you, <CHARNAME>? It would cost 2,000 gold.~
@8183 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>, one Wand of the Apprenti coming right up. Simple, easy, and I really hope it works.~
@8184 = ~What? Oh sure, it will do something. I think.~
@8185 = ~Well, that was an interesting lesson.~
@8186 = ~We completely kicked that wand's a...~
@8187 = ~... and this one's for grandma, who said I'd never amount to anything more than a butterknife!!~ [SSWORD49]
@8188 = ~Look, magic is dangerous! He knew it! You know it! I... I know it too. Let's... I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.~
@8189 = ~There is a Mislead scroll which will cost 250 gold in supplies, Abi Dalzim's Horrid Wilting at 1,000 gold, and Meteor Swarm at 2,500 gold. That is also the order of difficulty.~
@8190 = ~Very well.  We'll start working on the Mislead scroll.~
@8191 = ~Yes, we'll be done before we know it. A few days I think.~
@8192 = ~Yes, we'll be done before we know it. Another four days I think.~
@8193 = ~We'll be okay. We've got to learn this stuff sooner or later. Four or five days from now and we'll be laughing about how hard we thought it was.~
@8194 = ~We'll be okay. We've got to learn this stuff sooner or later. A few days from now and we'll be laughing about how hard we thought it was.~
@8195 = ~This really makes me nervous, but if you want to be a powerful mage I guess you have to work with powerful magic.~
@8196 = ~I hope this works. I know you'll put our efforts to good use.~
@8197 = ~I love this. I feel like Elminster when the magic arcs through my hands. Sure they are numb for a few hours, but it's still great.~
@8198 = ~We did pretty good, if I might say so.~
@8199 = ~We did quite well!~
@8200 = ~I'm afraid... I'm afraid that Nara...~
@8201 = ~And I'm amazed at how we manage to stand ourselves, what with us being cowards.~
@8202 = ~Quit making excuses. What it boils down to is that we stink.~
@8203 = ~We made the spell. It worked. It all seemed good, and then a slip of the tongue... a twitch in a casting finger...~
@8204 = ~Now comes serious enchantment. These items are powerful, and also potentially deadly if not constructed properly. They show the true benefits of magical infusion.~
@8205 = ~The second is the Ring of Wizardry. Such rings are legendary in their usefulness. Usually only masters make them, but I would like to try. It will cost 3,000 gold to make.~
@8206 = ~The third is... is from the advanced class. I borrowed a tome from a friend of mine who said no one has attempted it in years. It is armor for a mage. It is a Staff of Power, and will cost... 10,000 gold.~
@8207 = ~There is risk in all of these, particularly the last one. I think they are doable, but the making will be difficult, almost assuredly deadly.~
@8208 = ~Are you sure of this? I imagine this will not be viewed as a failure, but it is certainly an anticlimactic way to end an apprenticeship.~
@8209 = ~Then the apprenticeship is over. I... I thank you for the opportunity to study under you.~
@8210 = ~Yeah, I guess it was a fun time. I... aw shucks, I don't do goodbyes well.~
@8211 = ~Farewell <CHARNAME>. I thank you for this. All of it.~
@8212 = ~Then the Robe of the Apprenti is what it shall be. This may take another tenday to figure out, but I'm sure you will be pleased in the end.~
@8213 = ~Ready to direct our lessons, <CHARNAME>? The choices available were the Wand of the Apprenti for 1,000, the Dagger of <CHARNAME> for 250, and the Ring of Protection for 2,000.~
@8214 = ~There is Mislead which will cost 250 gold in supplies, Horrid Wilting at 1,000 gold, and Meteor Swarm at 2,500 gold. That is also the order of difficulty.~
@8215 = ~Wait, wait! I must raise the gold for these things.~
@8216 = ~Very well. Please, return before I regain my senses and decide these things are better left to archmagi.~
@8217 = ~Well, <CHARNAME>? Are you able to supply the needed gold? 250 for the Robe of the Apprenti, 3,000 for the Ring of Wizardry, or... or 10,000 for the Staff of Power.~
@8218 = ~Wait, wait! I must still raise the gold for these things.~
@8219 = ~This tomb has been cracked open and anything of value has been removed. Looters have broken the fingers of the corpse, no doubt to take something it was holding.~
@8220 = ~Amulet of Power
This amulet bears the signature enchantments of Conster Damon, an archmage that fell in the Year of the Dracorage (1018DR).  The crispness of its etchings may have faded with fire and time, but it still echoes his famous defiant cries: "Your magic denied!" "I will be heard!" "Defeat comes swiftly!" "Take nothing from me!" It has seen much use, and changed hands many times through blood and battle.

@8221 = ~This is a fine task for a final project. I certainly hope the ring functions properly.~
@8222 = ~This is stretching our luck, even for me. I really don't even understand half of the conjuring I'm doing. Perhaps this was a mistake.~
@8223 = ~I hope you enjoy the robe when it is done. I put much of myself into it. I hope it will be worth it.~
@8224 = ~Nara and Larz are both dead, leaving me alone. Head of the class now, I guess... I... guess.~
@8225 = ~At least their deaths have been for something. The Ring of Wizardry turned out wonderful. It cost... 3,000 gold... and two lives. I suppose that is a bargain.~
@8226 = ~Their deaths... their deaths were for nothing. The ring fouled when I lost their voices from the incantations. 3,000 gold and... and two lives. Gone.~
@8227 = ~I am sure you are, as will be their parents. I'm not sure what my superiors were expecting, though. I told them this was a bad idea.~
@8228 = ~I will report the fates of these youths to the proper people, and you will see no more of me for a time.~
@8229 = ~Well quit stalling and get her over here then.~
@8230 = ~That was a single creature, and you say you have multiple ones? I think the enterprise will cost you... oh... 9,000 gold.~
@8231 = ~9,000 gold! That is outrageous!~
@8232 = ~Fine, I'll take it.~
@8233 = ~A pleasure doing business with you. You are in that wondrously odd sphere, are you not? I'll have my friend come by there tomorrow.~
@8234 = ~(sniff!)  I wish I could have been there... bloody sickness just... (sniff!) ... washed over me.  It has to be the curse!  (sniff!)  Oh, well... at least I'll get to play Velden, still.~
@8235 = ~A pleasure, as always. Ahh, but such a waste to watch your blood drain to the sewers. Can you hear them? The rats are singing.~
@8236 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>, I heard you approach. Did you appreciate the performance? Was it to your liking? I should hope so. You will see it again in future.~
@8237 = ~Sssssthhh... Mazzy... you left us here... no matter... join the delightful darknesss...

(The shadow chitters in a most disturbing manner)~
@8238 = ~Ha! Excellent, my servant! Hahah! Our Lady Knight shall embrace the darkness and give the gift of flesh that I might keep my hold on this mortal plane.~ [SHADEL08]
@8239 = ~Bravado, of course. Your kind grows tiresome and predictable yet you may be of some use to me.~ [SHADEL12]
@8240 = ~Oh, but you shall, mortal. This body that I inhabit grows tired. You shall make an excellent replacement. Come my shades! Open the portal! This brash fool has some strength.~ [SHADEL13]
@8241 = ~Oh, I would be glad to help you, truly I would... but we simply must help Uncle Quayle, first!  We must!~
@8242 = ~I know little of wizards except that they meddle in the affairs of others far too often.  Aid me first in this cause, my friend, and I will then strive to aid you in yours.  Let us be off.~

@8248 = ~Khalid of my heart, let my love... my love guide the way...~
@8249 = ~I regret that I do not know how they could be sent home, but if what you say is true they would be honored guests here.~
@8250 = ~Have them come and I shall give them lodgings. There is always evil to strive against, even if they are not in their home plane. They can do their work here.~
@8251 = ~I thank you, though they would rather go home.~
@8252 = ~We are ready, of course. Our home beckons from beyond the walls of dimensions.~
@8253 = ~And with that, we are gone.~
@8254 = ~I see. You are suggesting that we make what lives we can within this paladins' order. Perhaps... perhaps we should.~
@8255 = ~You there! You are <CHARNAME>, are you not? I have a message, a message from the Cowled Wizards.~
@8256 = ~But, seeing as how they all survived, you are cordially invited to their graduation, which we will be holding right here.~
@8257 = ~They are a small class, and renting a hall would be excessive. I hope you are dressed for it, you are the only guest. It starts in... oh, about 5 minutes.~
@8258 = ~But, seeing as how at least some of them survived your tutelage, you are cordially invited to the graduation ceremony, which will be held right here.~
@8259 = ~Wait, I need to know if you can help me send these Solamnic Knights home.~
@8260 = ~And before you ask, no, I have no information about Imoen. I will ask again, because I know you will pester me.~
@8261 = ~Well, that was certainly unpleasant. Sorry I... sorry I wasn't much help, but I... I... sprained a... casting finger. Heh heh...~ [TEOSXX07]
@8262 = ~You are not the only one with enemies. The Cowled Wizards have many. Some are incredibly fanatical as well.~
@8263 = ~That is unfortunate. Such an abrupt end to this long relationship. I will almost miss you. Almost. Farewell then.~
@8264 = ~All right, I will help.~
@8265 = ~You are now barred from entering the sphere. It's a little spell we've been working on. So sorry.~
@8266 = ~Good and good. Here is the rune. Be careful; it will only work on Lord Argrim and it has a frightfully long casting time.~
@8267 = ~Whatever, just do it. If he continues magic use will be grounds for torture and executions, not imprisonment. He is the greater of two evils.~
@8268 = ~A noble cause that I shall be glad to help you with.~
@8269 = ~So ends the Morning Ritual.~
@8270 = ~Do not get presumptuous with me, <GIRLBOY>... you do not want to provoke the wrath of the Cowled Wizards.  But I have heard a little of what you speak.~
@8271 = ~Now... I have told you all I know.  Do not bother any of my order further with your ignorant questions, for you shall learn no more than I have given you.~
@8272 = ~Hail, good people, I welcome you to Trademeet. Mind not the worried stares of our citizens while you are here. Strangers are not easily trusted these days.~
@8273 = ~Hail, I welcome you to Trademeet. I trust you will not earn the worried stares you have received so far?~ [CELOGA02]
@8274 = ~Until recently we did not know where to place blame, but now the people have found a target. The last group attacked saw several figures directing the chaos.~
@8275 = ~Hardly. Tensions have just made people quick to judge. If you had appeared a tenday ago you would have found your welcome colder still.~
@8276 = ~I am anxious about this new group. It is rumored that it is led by a woman, but we know nothing of her, not even her name.~
@8277 = ~So ends the Noontide Ritual.~
@8278 = ~I will recite the Tenets of the Faith.~
@8279 = ~I should have crept quietly as the vine instead of blustering as the wind. On occasion I forget the subtleties that allow nature to progress.~
@8280 = ~Very well, though I would have preferred to accompany you.  Sometimes Nature needs her servants to act as one.~
@8281 = ~No one is safe in Trademeet, many are panicking.  They blame the druids, and no druid -- or any outsider-- is welcome within the town at the moment.~
@8282 = ~Your ruin continues with the devastation of Garren Windspear in your name. Away goes his child from under your nose, and I wonder who shall bear the blame!~
@8283 = ~I'm sure there is a reason... but it isn't anything we've done.  Trademeet is a peaceful town where business is conducted fairly... blessed by Waukeen herself!~
@8284 = ~I don't know what kind of reward the mayor is offering, but that's a possibility.  The town would be grateful to be rid of this menace, that much I know.~
@8285 = ~You seek Imoen, your lost comrade.  I am prepared to give you her location, and the means with which to reach her.~ [BODHIX30]
@8286 = ~I know much and will share it. You do not know the full picture of the man, and I cannot blame you for your cautiousness.~
@8287 = ~It is true that Irenicus was your captor, and indeed, your stay in his care was not the most comfortable, but there were circumstance that you are not aware of.~
@8288 = ~Irenicus requested a service of the Shadow Thieves, for which they demanded your capture as payment. You are of great interest to them, as you probably know.~
@8289 = ~I will get to that in a moment. While you were in Jon's... 'care' he discovered the potential you have, and resolved to aid your development.~
@8290 = ~Trademeet is a peaceful town... we haven't even had the Sythillisian Empire to worry about, yet.  And yet we are attacked by wild animals... it is almost beyond belief!~
@8291 = ~But I do!  I do! Listen to me... it won't stop with the animals.  Soon, the floods will come... an' the storms!  Trademeet will be washed away, you'll see.~
@8292 = ~So you would betray your 'brother' even as you rescue him? He deserves worse.~
@8293 = ~What was the nature of the fight with the Shadow Thieves?~
@8294 = ~That I cannot tell.  Likely they wished to observe or interrogate. Either way, they wished you alive. That has probably changed with your recent actions, however.~
@8295 = ~They're jus' waitin' for the big genie to come an' kill us all.  The gods are angry.  If not the genies, it'll be them Sythillisian ogres.  One or the other.~
@8296 = ~You ask too much of me. I have already paid a large amount of gold for your help.~
@8297 = ~Sythillisian ogres?~
@8298 = ~You don't know about th' genies holdin' all o' Trademeet hostage?  They owns everythin'... gold, supplies, food.  An' they won't give none of it up.~
@8299 = ~Just outside o' Riatavin... thousands of monsters, all under a bunch o' ogres.  Taken over half of Amn.  Just let 'em all in to deal with the genies, I says.~
@8300 = ~It will not interfere.  You will reach Irenicus and Imoen with ease, for they are both in the same place; a horrible place designed to hold the strong-willed.~
@8301 = ~You!  You're the ones that have been behind all o' the towns troubles!  I knew you were nothing but trouble th' first time I laid eyes on you!~
@8302 = ~Then it is a simple matter of retrieving Imoen from this place.~
@8303 = ~The island it is located on is under its own rule, and even the Cowled Wizards are not certain what becomes of those sent there.~
@8304 = ~It is considered a necessary evil, and like so many other evils, no one really wanted to deal with it once it began.~
@8305 = ~I have used your gold to secure passage to the isle. You will have to contend with the asylum itself, and with the pirates that run the isle.~
@8306 = ~Anyway, it is with great honor that I welcome our graduates to the... er... stage.  Morul, Larz, Nara, you are mages today.~
@8307 = ~Duh. We'd be dead.~
@8308 = ~Oh shush. <CHARNAME>, we certainly appreciate this.~
@8309 = ~But under the benevolent yoke of the Cowled Wizards you will be somewhat protected from arrest. Go forth into that brave new world, quietly and carefully.~
@8310 = ~Hehe, oh those wacky kids. Celebrations all around!~
@8311 = ~Oooh, that burns. Anyway, that's it for our ceremonies. Morul, you can now look forward to a long career under the benevolent yoke of the Cowled Wizards.~
@8312 = ~Go softly and quietly into the real world, and I'm sure you will be mostly safe from arrest and persecution.~
@8313 = ~Graduating class of 1369DR, we salute you.~
@8314 = ~Oooh, that burns.~
@8315 = ~She and the others involved in the disturbance were taken into custody, that much you know. They proved too unruly for simple incarceration.~
@8316 = ~They are no longer in the city. I could get nothing further from my superiors, and I expect that asking for more would yield a harsh response.~
@8317 = ~Hold, traveler. What is your business here in Athkatla?~
@8318 = ~Now really, there is no cause for that.~
@8319 = ~You'll pay you will, or yous get a face full of fist. That's pretty clear, isn't it?~
@8320 = ~Fight! Kill him!~
@8321 = ~I'm not doing a thing. It's amusing, so I'm going to watch.~
@8322 = ~That's it? You're not going to help? What kind of people are you!~
@8323 = ~So you're all bluff and no bite, eh? Get outta here, before I tie your toes in a knot!~
@8324 = ~I knew that fool was all bluster and no muster, but thanks for your help all the same.~
@8325 = ~Such things are not for you to know... yet. When the time comes you will know much, and if the Mistress bids it, you may also live.~
@8326 = ~I know you not, but you are the enemy of those that would help me!~
@8327 = ~No more so than you! Why did you attack Irenicus? His capture deprived me of my revenge!~
@8328 = ~You have done well, and for that I am grateful. We had a deal, and I am certain you are eager to see it fulfilled.~ [ARAN18]
@8329 = ~Your map has many notes and locations marked on it.  If you ever get lost, using it is a sure way to get back on course.~
@8330 = ~Try using different party formations to protect your weaker party members.~
@8331 = ~You can turn down the feedback levels (circles under your character etc.) in the options page to suit your playing style.~
@8332 = ~Like others of its type, this halberd consists of a cleaver-like axe blade mounted on a staff approximately six feet in length. It has also been bestowed with a small number of magical properties, however, thus making it more effective in combat. Its keen blade, for instance, will shear through your opponent's flesh to find the bone while its barbed tip will seek out gaps in their armor.

@8333 = ~He must be found, and that is best facilitated by helping you find Imoen. They were taken to the same place, you see.~
@8334 = ~Nothing like some time ashore... all I needs is some grog an' a good lass on me lap.~ [MALSAL02]
@8335 = ~We are not sure. Spies within the Cowled Wizards tell us that they have not had direct contact with the isle for some time.~
@8336 = ~Mostly only happens at night though, and the city is so much more impressive during the day anyway.~
@8337 = ~They don't scare me. Look at this bunch. Dead as they can get, and their black little hoods didn't help them one bit.~
@8338 = ~What killed them was a lot more than you could handle. Look... look at the marks on them.~

@8345 = ~Beware the streets at night, my children. There are strange things taking from the coffers of your lives. Best invest in the day to be certain of many returns.~
@8346 = ~Very well, an in-depth response. Your fathers are my interest. Your lineage crosses the mortal and spiritual, and both concern me somewhat.~ [FIRKRA10]
@8347 = ~He was also an adventurer in his day, and crossed my path long ago. Him and his Harper friends. I bear the scars of that meeting.~ [FIRKRA12]

@8352 = ~Do I know this? Do I really? Oh, very well. The brat was but a byproduct of my scrutiny of you anyway.~
@8353 = ~What do you know of Irenicus!~
@8354 = ~Now walk away, and see to your little rescue efforts. Take your time. Enjoy life. You have much to face.~
@8355 = ~Do not think me soft because of this. I am capable of far more than you can imagine. Of course you are destined to experience worse.~
@8356 = ~You return? Oh, why do you insist on bothering me? (sigh) You would think that the children of the gods would have something better to do.~ [FIRKRA15]

@8358 = ~I wish you safe travels. I am hopeful you can prevail against the odds set before you.~

@8367 = ~Suffice it to say that we have come on a service, hunting a criminal of some repute from Calimshan... a rakshasi by the name of Ihtafeer.~
@8368 = ~Rakshasa, of which the rakshasi are females, if you have never encountered them, are devious shapeshifters and thieves.  We have followed this particular prey for quite some months now, and she has eluded us at every turn.~
@8369 = ~We Dao buy all that comes here, you see, and charge prices too high for the mortals to afford... and we will not relinquish it until the mortals find this rakshasi for us.~
@8370 = ~Indeed we are!  The Dao grew tired of chasing this little rakshasi... one does not always have to do things the difficult way, after all.~
@8371 = ~Hmmmn.  I would say, mortal, that I wish the head of this rakshasi returned to me... and once that was done, despite the amusements we have found here, the Dao would return to Calimshan.~
@8372 = ~Very well.  I will attempt to find this rakshasa and bring her head back to you... if that means you will leave Trademeet.~
@8373 = ~Ah, it is one of our wayfarers once again!  Tell me, what can the Dao do for you this time, my friend?~ [TRGENI07]
@8374 = ~Hmmm... this is promising news, mortal.  Promising, indeed.  But if you wish your reward, you must bring the head of the rakshasi to us.  We shall await its delivery!~
@8375 = ~Wondrous!  Find the dreaded rakshasi, mortal... bring us her head and the Dao shall be pleased!~
@8376 = ~You must be careful, mortal one!  Ihtafeer is a ruhk, a knight of the rakshasa... she is a wondrous being of magic and may only be struck by the most powerful magic, herself!  Cautious, cautious, little mortal!~
@8377 = ~Oooh, poor mortal you are!  Too timid to find the mighty rakshasi ruhk for us!  It is a sad, sad thing to see you here.~
@8378 = ~Oh, come now, mortal!  It is only a ruhk rakshasi and her companions we seek!  You are a strong and powerful being, yourself, are you not?~
@8379 = ~So if you know where the ruhk lies, excellent!  I suggest you go forth and retrieve her head for us, yes?  We shall await your return!~

@8386 = ~Bodhi? Am I to be subservient to this foppish milksop?~
@8387 = ~My family is one of the wealthiest in Athkatla... we have interests in the gold mines up north and the shipwrights here in the city.  So I will thank you not to stand too close~
@8388 = ~Er, of course. A stalwart captain is always prepared for any eventuality.~

@8395 = ~You are a hero who might enter that tomb and retrieve the circlet for me, if you are willing.  In return, I will pay you 1,000 gold.  What do you say, my <LADYLORD>?~
@8396 = ~What?!  You are very rude, even for a commoner.  Very well, if that is how you wish to be, I cannot stop you.  If you change your mind, do come and speak to me again.~
@8397 = ~All that has recently changed.  An old tome belonging to my family states that there is proof; that proof can be found right here in Trademeet.~
@8398 = ~I see.  How you gained your vaunted reputation, then, is beyond my knowledge.  But I can do nothing about it.  If your courage changes, however, do come and see me again.~
@8399 = ~Yes, Saemon Havarian, it was particularly wily of you to distract those other ships we saw in the distance. I take it that your signals in the night were some type of warning?~
@8400 = ~Of... of course, Mistress Bodhi, it had merely slipped my mind for the moment.~
@8401 = ~Find out how to safely breach the asylum and rescue your comrade, Imoen. I shall await the inevitable ruckus and meet you afterwards.~
@8402 = ~How do you know of her? You do not seem like her usual lackeys.~
@8403 = ~Mistress Bodhi is a delicious evil, one that I am better for having known. I merely mention her coldness to test your own thoughts.~
@8404 = ~Enough of this for now, I must carry out my duties and see to your entrenchment within the town.~
@8405 = ~Greetings again, <CHARNAME>.  Lady Lilith and Lord Skarmaen are not annoying you overmuch, I hope?  Again, I urge you to be cautious.~
@8406 = ~Oh Light! Can it be? You come, <MANWOMAN> bearing the bones of the Child Prophetess Amuana! Her defilement is at an end.~
@8407 = ~I have a name about this town, that is not spoken in polite company. My presence would prove more hindrance than help.~
@8408 = ~Ah! There you are. I see that you have weathered the storms of this place with reasonable pluck and health. It does me good to see you alive.~ [PPSAEM16]
@8409 = ~Having trouble? Haha! I should've thought that those in Mistress Bodhi's employ would be more adept at caring for their own needs.~ [PPSAEM13]
@8410 = ~I intend no other.~
@8411 = ~There is a representative of the Cowled Wizards here as well. I know that he comes and goes whenever he pleases, so he must have a key or some such.~
@8412 = ~Sime shall also advise you, <CHARNAME>. She is acquainted with a few of the inhabitants of the island.~
@8413 = ~I do not trust this pirate, <CHARNAME>. His manner is that of a fool, but his behavior during the voyage betrays a cunning mind beneath.~
@8414 = ~He has delivered us as promised. There are more important things to worry about.~
@8415 = ~Agreed. Be prepared, this place is dangerous enough even without my suspicions of Saemon.~
@8416 = ~We may need his ship for our return. No, just be on your guard. He is probably the least of our worries in this place.~
@8417 = ~I knew he would prove treacherous. Our threats were sufficient to keep us safe while afloat, but there must be someone here that he fears even more.~
@8418 = ~There are more important things to worry about right now, anyway. I must see that you are able to enter the asylum.~
@8419 = ~The search has not gone well. I do not know how to get inside.~
@8420 = ~I have a ward token that will unlock the gates.~
@8421 = ~Always did have a mercenary's heart. I probably helped him cut it out. Nevertheless, here. Take this. It should be enough to pay him off.~
@8422 = ~A loud gong sounds and you fear you may have failed in the task that the drow have given you.~
@8423 = ~Saemon Havarian said I might find what I need here.~
@8424 = ~'One' gets an appointment by being worthy of it! Ain't just anyone that can get in here! Gotta be referred here by someone he knows.~
@8425 = ~And how much would this cost?~
@8426 = ~But Saemon Havarian said I might find what I need here.~
@8427 = ~What? Hey, sure, you bet. Usually people just go find someone to name-drop, but if you want to pay, go right in. Just made my wage for the season!~
@8428 = ~Saemon? Saemon Havarian? Uh, all right, you can go in, if you really want to.~
@8429 = ~You're okay by me, friend. Go where you want.~

@8438 = ~A moment? No, all the moments are together. All together and with another. I have no moments.~
@8439 = ~Proceed to the recreation area. Enjoy your time out; you go back under key when night comes.~
@8440 = ~What is this place? Strange question coming from you. It was my understanding that you wanted to be confined here.~
@8441 = ~But I suppose you ARE out of your mind, so I will explain. This is Spellhold, I am Lonk, you are an inmate, and this is recreation time. Frolic, if you please.~
@8442 = ~And your job here?~
@8443 = ~Imoen? I think so. Hard to say. There is a girl here that used to answer to that. Don't think she remembers it anymore.~
@8444 = ~Irenicus? How do you know that name? Hmm, no matter. You'll be seeing him soon enough. He sees everybody.~
@8445 = ~Try to stop pestering me. It's hard enough keeping an eye on all of these weaving robes of spellcasters.~
@8446 = ~Oh, please try to stay away from Wanev. He's very excitable. Still sore about losing his position here. I tell him he shouldn't dwell on it, but he's quite inconsolable.~
@8447 = ~Wh-who... who is that? Keep back. Keep back!~ [IMOEN63]
@8448 = ~Stop fooling around, Imoen, I don't have time for it.~
@8449 = ~Hello. You are new. Those your faces? Funny... ha! Maybe change them.~ [PPDILI02]
@8450 = ~<GABBER>? Ok, I'll be <GABBER> tomorrow. I've seen you, so now I can take your face. Don't worry, you can keep it too.~
@8451 = ~Nothing. Don't you change your face? That's okay, I'll take it and change it for you. Don't worry, you can keep it too. Who are you today?~
@8452 = ~I like taking puppy's face, but it scares him. He's not here though.~
@8453 = ~Stiletto of Demarchess +2
Most who take up the trade of murder for hire do so for reasons other than personal pleasure, but not so the Lady Demarche.  She took special pleasure in the torture of her targets... which is why she made this dagger.  With but one touch of its polished blade an opponent was rendered immobile, incapable of so much as screaming, yet the victim could watch and feel all that happened to them.  While her opponent was thus held, the Lady would slowly bleed them, sometimes taking several hours before allowing her subject to succumb to the final agony of death.  The Lady finally fell victim to her own evil; disarmed by a rival and struck by her own Stiletto her fate was soon sealed.

@8474 = ~Yes, I believe that you would.  I can't blame you, really, not when I wish the death of others for similar reasons.  A pity one of us must be denied.~

@8509 = ~Harper's Call (Necromancy) 
Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 1 round 
Area of Effect: 1 person 
Saving Throw: Special 

This spell is only available to Harpers.  The Harper's Call restores a comrade to life, to further service the cause of the Harpers.  This spell functions similar to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions.  The Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 hit points) to successfully raise the deceased person.  In addition, the person has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.  Lastly, the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.~
@8510 = ~D-death?  I suppose it is better than living like this...  Oooh, the evil... it's building in me!  The urges!  Aaah, y-your flesh!  I must have your flesh!!~
@8511 = ~Ring of Acuity:
The origins of this ring are unclear, and while its enchantments share similarities with historical examples of Rings of Wizardry, there is something strange in how it feels, either in the weight of the metal or in the aura it projects, and it does not function the same.  It was likely found on some distant plane, and as such, its maker will remain a mystery to you.

@8549 = ~Iron Skins (Alteration) 
Sphere: Elemental
Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a druid casts this powerful spell upon herself, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground completely covering her.  This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the druid in no way.  The effect of this is to protect the druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles.  For every two levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting.  For example, a 10th level druid would receive 5 skins.  For each skin the druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th level druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against her but the sixth would affect her normally.  The skins will remain on the druid until she is affected by a dispel magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks or the spell duration expires.  It is important to note that this will not protect the druid from any area attacks such as fireball, however it will protect her from physical magical attacks such as magic missile.~

Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Level: 7
Range: 120 yds.
Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 40' radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by a priest, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect.
There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake.  The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6D6 points of damage (save vs. spell at a -6 penalty for half damage).  Those who fail their saving throws fall to the ground for four rounds.

The second tremor is less severe, causing 3D6 points of damage (save for half at a -2 penalty).  The final tremor causes 2D6 damage (save for half).

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use.  Finally, Earth Elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear.  This elemental will attack the party.~
@8557 = ~Symbol, Death
(Conjuration,Summoning) 
Sphere: Guardian
Level: 7
Range: 30 yards
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface.  The symbol will remain there until someone comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all those within the area to make a save vs. death or die.  Creatures with more than 60 current hit points are immune to this effect.~

@8564 = ~10,000 gold will change your tune.~
@8565 = ~You know, I really preferred Wanev as director. It was a shame what Irenicus did to him. I will help you, I think. You may do as you wish with the inmates.  I'll be back when this mess is cleared up.~
@8566 = ~2,000! That's... that's a fortune! I could get pretty far on that... yes sir... hmmm.~
@8567 = ~10,000?! You *are* out of your mind. I have never even seen that much gold. Get back to your cell before I get mad.~
@8568 = ~2,000 then! How about that?~
@8569 = ~How about 10,000. A fortune!~
@8570 = ~10,000 then! Think of it!~
@8571 = ~Tonight I'm someone free? What face should I wear for this?~ [PPDILI09]
@8572 = ~Is that the rule of all you survey, or beyond? W-w-what of those that walk inside, and around, and through? That stand where you stand now?~ [PPAPHR09]
@8573 = ~None stand where Tiax stands, lest he walk atop them... mm-hmm.~ [PPTIAX14]
@8574 = ~Hehehehehee... he did this... He did this! I will... uh... we must find him! He is the cause! He is the one that brings the tests!~ [ppwane10]
@8575 = ~Irenicus? Oh... I took his face once. His punishment was...~ [PPDILI10]
@8576 = ~No... to look at him is to see too far... I cannot look to him...~ [PPNALJ11]
@8577 = ~He is cold through all the planes... none walk where he does, though they see him not!~ [PPAPHR11]
@8578 = ~Down to the dogs! Bad dogs!~ [PPDRAD14]

@8580 = ~It matters not! All will fall eventually!~ [PPTIAX18]
@8581 = ~What is this?  You have released all of my test subjects?  How wonderfully mad of you.  I did not expect this in the least, so dangerously risky it is.~ [IRENIC54]
@8582 = ~Your fate has been sealed with the curse I transferred to you.  I have the souls from both you and Imoen, and they have healed Bodhi and myself.  You will die in our place, or worse.~
@8583 = ~Hmph.  You think you're trustworthy?  We have enough problems here in Trademeet, even without those druids.~
@8584 = ~Bodhi tells me you have exhibited a... transformation. With your will slowly fading perhaps the essence of Bhaal will rise to take you. That would be a sight, I am sure.~
@8585 = ~Die!  All of you!  I have restored my soul and will work my revenge without your interference!~ [IRENIC55]
@8586 = ~Damn you all, why do I fight over this place when my plans may be laid anywhere! I must start anew!~ [IRENIC56]

@8590 = ~The mage spell Limited Wish works much better if you have a high wisdom.~
@8591 = ~The 3rd level priest spell Zone Of Sweet Air will remove all cloud area effect spells such as Stinking Cloud.~
@8592 = ~Why would you encourage me so? You were in his service!~
@8593 = ~So I will offer my service to you, in the hopes that we can benefit one another. I'm sure you can understand the motives of self-preservation.~
@8594 = ~What could you possibly offer me?~
@8595 = ~Step up, step up, and test your luck upon the wheel. A simple game with simple goals!~
@8596 = ~Round and round the spire she goes, and where she stops, Tymora knows.~
@8597 = ~The Lady giveth, and the Lady taketh away. No winner, step back.~
@8598 = ~Sorry, my friend, but you and any you travel with are no longer allowed at the table. Someone wins too much and people start calling foul. No chances taken here.~
@8599 = ~'Ey, step up. Don't be afraid of the table, my friends. Roll your luck and see what comes.~
@8600 = ~The dice are high, the house is low! 1 gold has got you 2! These dice are charmed to win for sure!~
@8601 = ~They were fightin', and we hoped they would split and go the straight an... uh... narrow. No luck though.~
@8602 = ~Been on a spree o' crimes. They dedicated most o' what they've done to the person that got them back together.~
@8603 = ~I'd like to give a kick to that person, I tell you. That... uh... ah, lost my thought. Better relax for a bit, I think...~
@8604 = ~That will be fine if I stay. Let me see what else you've got first.~
@8605 = ~If it's all the same to you, I'll pass on that offer for now.~
@8606 = ~You'll fit right in then. We treat everyone equal in here, mostly because they are. The nobles stay in the city.~
@8607 = ~That won't be me. I don't care at all.~
@8608 = ~I don't care one whit whether you care about what I care... Why am I wasting my time on you? Goodbye.~
@8609 = ~You don't know anything about it, and I suggest you keep it that way. We don't want to draw attention to this.~
@8610 = ~Yeah... I guess.~
@8611 = ~Yeah, I'd hate to have to hurt you or something.~
@8612 = ~Not like they've been help so far. They've just had guards following us, making sure we don't do anything wrong.~
@8613 = ~I know, I know, but are we ready to go it alone? I mean, your father has kept what we do quiet.~
@8614 = ~Yeah. Yeah! The complete and total stranger is right!~
@8615 = ~Thanks <CHARNAME>! We owe this all to you!~
@8616 = ~Is it? Is that all that matters? Even if you do things that others don't approve of?~
@8617 = ~You! You are <CHARNAME> aren't you! I warned you! I told you not to get involved!~
@8618 = ~They certainly aren't shy about saying who got them back together. Your name is mud around here.~
@8619 = ~The most important thing? You don't know them. You don't know their parents. How could you claim to know what was best?~
@8620 = ~I didn't realize the evil you would cause. I have no choice but to end this now.~
@8621 = ~You know, maybe I should give you some more advice. You should really split up.~
@8622 = ~We haven't given a thought to that since we talked with you. We realized that we were the only ones that mattered.~
@8623 = ~The only ones! And if we love each other it doesn't matter what we do.~
@8624 = ~And if we want to go out in a blaze of glory, that's our business!~
@8625 = ~But slandering my name is *my* business. I didn't think you would act like this!~
@8626 = ~I've heard some nonsense about someone challenging them, but I don't put stock in it.  The Shadow Thieves have as much power as the Cowled Wizards, you know...~
@8627 = ~Good to see your person well and sound. As you can see, the way is clear and we are free. Now to the business at hand.~ [PPSAEM18]
@8628 = ~I'm glad to see you, though our meeting is colored by the unfortunate events I must relate. I had hoped them settled, but... I am denied.~ [PPSAEM20]
@8629 = ~I have no ship with which to offer passage. It has been scuttled in an act of the purest malice. Such villainy I am subjected to!~ [PPSAEM21]
@8630 = ~But if anyone could be helpin' ye with that, it'd be the Shadow Thieves, themselves.  They could pry the secrets from a dead roach, if ye're willin' to pay the price, heh...~
@8631 = ~Then it is back to Spellhold and the magic portal to the Underdark.~
@8632 = ~Back to the magic portal under Spellhold then.~
@8633 = ~Ah! You return! I take it that you have reconsidered your foolish trek beneath the earth? I am still willing to transport you if you help me secure a ship.~ [PPSAEM22]
@8634 = ~No, my mind is set.~
@8635 = ~Very well, I will set out under cover of night and retrieve the horn.~
@8636 = ~What are you doing here without the horn? The sea gates are steadfastly locked until it is blown.~
@8637 = ~Then you likely can't buy me goods, either.  So be it, me poor <MANWOMAN>... we can be talkin' once you've some coin in yer pocket.~
@8638 = ~Ugh, speak not his name.~
@8639 = ~Then go if you are so offended.~
@8640 = ~I am not. I know where I stand.~
@8641 = ~You will anyway.  Ah... forgive me, I... I did not mean to offend.~
@8642 = ~Then let us forget I brought it up.~
@8643 = ~His guild be here in the Docks.  But ye'll not be able to get in.  Either ye meet with one who can arrange an introduction, or ye're lost.~
@8644 = ~An' if ye're thinkin' of contacting this guild, I can't.  Me friends say if they wish t' contact ye, someone will appear out o' the mist itself to talk to ye.~
@8645 = ~ZzzZZzzz...~
@8646 = ~(sigh) Message received... sleep then...~
@8647 = ~Who... who is there?!  Guards!  To my aid!  Intruders in my quarters!~
@8648 = ~If there is someone standing against such a group, they must have something to aid them... perhaps powerful magic.~
@8649 = ~They I wish you well, but I won't go with you. I'll stay here and try to complete my plan on my own.~
@8650 = ~I've heard whispers of a thieves' war... I don't know how there could be another guild as powerful as the Shadow Thieves, but maybe it is so.~
@8651 = ~Certainly not.  It must be wondrously devious,  to hold those powerful sorcerers... unless the Cowled Wizards do not simply... ah... kill them.~
@8652 = ~This new guild ain't in it for the gold.  They already GOT the gold.  Must be in it for the power...~
@8653 = ~Stand fast, I see lights approaching!~
@8654 = ~Saemon Havarian!~ [DESHAR08]
@8655 = ~Heh.  You know, there's all sorts of nasty stories about what the Cowled Wizards do with the mages they imprison.~
@8656 = ~But finding the Cowled Wizards themselves can be a feat, never mind finding their prisoners.  They could be atop the Cloudpeaks for all anyone knows.~
@8657 = ~But make no mistake: that other guild won't survive long.  The Shadow Thieves aren't about to let themselves be kicked out of another city, not after Waterdeep.~
@8658 = ~Blank stares all around!  All right then, I alone get the spoils!  You there!  Hand over your loot or I split your skulls wide!  1,000 gold will do!~
@8659 = ~All right, here's your damned gold.~
@8660 = ~The answer would be no, and I now demand a yes or no answer from you! 1,000 gold or your lives! Will you pay?~
@8661 = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells.  It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form.  Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical.  They know fewer spells than wizards, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time.  Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way wizards do.  Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a wizard.
NOTE:  A sorcerer does NOT learn spells from scrolls, but instead chooses new spells with each level.  A sorcerer's prime requisite is INTELLIGENCE.~
@8662 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action.  They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor.  Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own.  They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats.  The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.  

Monks must be of Lawful alignments.

Advantages:
-  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round, and gains 1/2 an additional attack every 3 levels.
-  The damage inflicted by the monk's fists goes up as as the monk increases in levels:
Level 1-2:  1-6
Level 3-5:  1-8
Level 6-8:  1-10
Level 9-14:  1-12
Level 15+: 1-20
-  A monk's natural armor class gets better as the monk goes up in levels.  Armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels until level 21, then every 3 levels until 30, then every 5 levels until 40.
-  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels.  All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned.  NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  Monks have the Deflect Missiles ability.  This gives them a -1 to their AC vs missiles for every 3 levels.
-  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
-  Monks have the Read Scrolls ability for cleric scrolls. A monk may equip a cleric scroll in a Quick Item slot and use it, casting the spell and consuming the scroll in the process.
-  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-  5th level:  Immunity to all diseases, and cannot be Slowed or Hasted.
-  7th level:  Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
-  8th level:  -1 to speed factor
-  9th level:  +1 to all saves.  Immune to charm.  The monk's fist is considered a +1 weapon (+2 at 12th, +3 at 15th)
-  11th level:  Immune to poison
-  12th level:  Another -1 to speed factor.   Fists are considered +2 weapons. 
-  13th level:  Quivering palm spell once per day.  This spell gives one hand attack.  If an opponent is struck, the opponent must Save Vs. Death or die.  NOTE:  this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
-  14th level:  The monk gains 3% innate magic resistance per level (starting a 42% at 14th level, and reaching a maximum of 78%)
-  15th level:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
-  20th level:  Immune to non-magical weapons

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear any armor
-  May not use the off-hand in combat, so may only use one-handed weapons available to the thief class, may not carry a shield, and may not dual-wield (use a second melee weapon.)~
@8663 = ~BARBARIAN: A barbarian can be an excellent warrior.  While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly be thrown into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

Advantages:
-  Moves at 2 points faster than the normal character movement rate
-  Immunity to backstab
-  Can Enrage once per day per every 4 levels (starts at 1st level with one use).  Enrage gives +4 to constitution and strength for 5 rounds.  Gives a 2 point armor class penalty and +2 to saves vs magic (for 5 rounds).  Rage also gives immunity to all charm, hold, fear, maze, confusion and level drain spells.
-  At 11th level the barbarian gains 10% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing and missile damage, and gains a further +5% to this at levels 15 and 19.
-  The barbarian rolls D12 for hit points instead of a fighter's D10.

Disadvantages:
-  Cannot wear full plate or plate mail armors.
-  Cannot specialize in weapons past normal specialization (two proficiency points.)~
@8664 = ~The Cowled Wizards keep their own counsel on that matter, I'm afraid.  They keep their own prison, I imagine, but its location is kept a secret.~
@8665 = ~Find Familiar 
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 1
Range: n/a
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 familiar
Saving Throw: Special

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion.  Familiars are typically small creatures.  A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well.  A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.  
(Note: This spell may only be cast by the protagonist, the central character.)
The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. 
The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. 
The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points.  However the caster must take care to treat his familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus hit-points and half the familiar's hit-points again as damage.  Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A mage has 12 hit points and casts find familiar. The imp summoned has 18 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 9 hit points.  The caster now has 21 hit points.  If the familiar dies the caster loses those 9 hit points (putting him back at 12), 1 point of constitution permanently (which may cause additional hit point loss), and takes 9 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

@8682 = ~And that also means, regrettably, that we can do nothing if we oppose their actions. And still the Council deludes itself into thinking the Cowled Wizards obey them.~
@8683 = ~If you are thinking of dealing with either, don't. A number of bodies have turned up... recruits by either side. I am sure you don't want to end up like that.~
@8684 = ~I also have it on authority of Isaea Roenall that Nalia was distraught after the death of her father, and that he has placed her under his care as a protective measure.~
@8685 = ~I am afraid it is his word against yours, and no matter what you think Nalia has said of her motivations, Isaea is the more credible claimant.~
@8686 = ~Remember that nothing is proven. Any number of factors could place his insignia there and not directly involve him. Whatever the truth is, we will be sure to expose it.~
@8687 = ~Nalia, my dear, I must reiterate what a shame it is your father is no longer with us. He was a fine man, despite his eccentricities.~
@8688 = ~Lord de'Arnise certain kept varied company. I recognize very few people, least of all yourself. If you would excuse me...~
@8689 = ~That may well be, but today is not the time for such things. We are celebrating a life in this place, and all grievances should be put aside.~
@8690 = ~I will try, Minister Adelain.~
@8691 = ~Again, your father would have appreciated it. Wander and speak with the others, and talk of how you felt about him.~
@8692 = ~Enjoy the company of others in the remembrance of Lord de'Arnise. He gave much to life while he lived.~
@8693 = ~Welcome to this place for this somber occasion. Mingle and celebrate the life of Lord de'Arnise. He would have everyone speak as equals.~
@8694 = ~Oh, Lord de'Arnise did fraternize with some... colorful company, I must say. Not what I would expect from a gentleman's funeral.~
@8695 = ~Oh he has, has he? He talks far too much for my comfort, Miss Tandolan. If you would excuse me?~
@8696 = ~My pleasure, my dear, though the honor to say such is mine. I hope I can aspire to gauge my integrity by comparison to your father's.~
@8697 = ~I thank you, my dear. Now go, and don't let the dark cloud above this place seep into your heart.~
@8698 = ~Would that Lord de'Arnise were here now. He always brightened a room with his antics.~
@8699 = ~Damn ye for dyin', de'Arnise! Ye still owed me a keg and a hunt since me last visit. To your health, wherever you are!~
@8700 = ~Then my work is done for the tenday. I will leave on this good note, before we start to crying and backslapping.~

@8751 = ~You are not the one who was prophesied to save us.  Indeed, you have destroyed us!  The Prince and the exiles were our last chance to keep our bloodline strong!~
@8752 = ~I am feeling generous today... to enter the Underdark, you need this magic rope from the king's corpse. Use it to go down the pit behind my former throne.~
@8753 = ~Our numbers are too few, our blood too thin.  We must regain what we have lost.  Prince Villynaty, the exiles' leader outside the city, is our only hope.~

It appears I have come through the portal only to enter some strange kind of prison that appears to be in another dimension.  Haer'Dalis and his troupe are nowhere in sight, but I did confront the bounty hunters... and have found a gnome by the name of Tagget who has apparently escaped from somewhere in this place.~
@8785 = ~Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison.

Bad news.  Tagget has informed me that there is no actual physical exit from the prison... the only way out is through the warden, himself, or through other powerful magic, such as the type Raelis demonstrated when she summoned the conduits.~
@8786 = ~Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison.

I have accepted Tagget's plan of an alternate route that may lead to a way out of here.  Going east, Tagget suggests I find the Master of Thralls and destroy his orb... the device that allows control over the slaves through their collars.  That done, the warden will not be protected and will be far easier to defeat... which, it seems, must be done lest the warden track any who leave.  Including us.~
@8787 = ~Rescue Raelis and Haer'Dalis from the planar prison.

The Master of Thralls dwarven slave has told me how to destroy the orb: a room I passed through contains a magical brazier in its center, the flames of which will destroy the item and release those who wear the collars... leaving the warden unprotected.~

Well, it seems that Raelis has given me the deed to the playhouse beneath the Five Flagons... although I've no actors, no director, no play or anything else to do with it, for that matter.  Owning a playhouse is a far cry from singing songs in taverns.

Fortunately, the owner of the inn, Samuel Thunderburp, seems to know a director who came to see Raelis, and is going to send him my way.~
@8789 = ~Running the Five Flagons Playhouse

The director is a strange little man named Higgold, whom I've agreed to put in charge of staging a play.  He said it would take about a week to roust up some actors and a decent play to put into production, and bade me to return after that time... with some coin, naturally, to invest.~
@8790 = ~Running the Five Flagons Playhouse

Higgold asked me to pick between two actresses for the lead role, Karenina.  I chose Jenna, as she seems far less trouble... hopefully, my choice is sound.~
@8791 = ~Running the Five Flagons Playhouse

Higgold asked me to pick between two actresses for the lead role, Karenina.  I chose Iltheia.  While she seems a bit of a diva, she is the better actress by Higgold's own admission... and I am sure I can handle whatever problems she causes.~
@8792 = ~Running the Five Flagons Playhouse

With the matter of financing settled, the play is ready to begin rehearsals.  Higgold has said he will send someone to find me if there are any problems that require my attention.  Rehearsals should take six to seven weeks, so I suppose I shouldn't travel to any other dimensions in the meantime... that might make me difficult to find, heh.

But it's official regardless.  I am the patron of an actual theater.~

@8822 = ~This is the key that you found in the ruined chapel of the complex in the Windspear Hills.~
@8823 = ~Gold has been placed in your keep.~
@8824 = ~An ornate, leather-bound tome.~
@8825 = ~This key will open the sealed tomb in the Trademeet Cemetery. The tomb used to be the place of burial for Trademeet's elite but has been sealed off for many years because of 'trouble' from within.~
@8826 = ~A golden circlet found within the sealed tomb in Trademeet's cemetery. The circlet is tarnished with age but one can still make out Waukeen's symbol on it.~
@8827 = ~This is the head of the rakshasa, Ihtafeer.~
@8828 = ~Slice Onion, crush garlic, peel chestnuts, and cut boar into tiny cubes.  In a greatpot over large flame heat oil; when it begins to smell hot, toss in the elk feces, then pour in horse urine.  Mmmmmm... can you smell great food already?

Maybe use different stuff for stew if boar not available.  Flesh of genies from tomb would work well.  Could use wolf men in west dungeon.  Hmmm.  If only I could avoid air monster in the well, then the well treasure would be MINE!  Then could buy any stuff for stew I wanted!~
@8829 = ~At first look this seems to be just a shattered piece of pottery.  Closer examination reveals that this is a single piece of King Strohm the third's burial mask.  With all of the pieces it would be possible to reconstruct the mask.  What good this would do, you do not know.~
@8830 = ~This is the reconstructed mask of King Strohm the third.  When you place it on your face, the entire world becomes tinted with odd colors.  Perhaps this mask will allow you to see something that you hadn't been able to before, but its use beyond that seems questionable.

Special:  Protects Against Critical Hits~
@8831 = ~Trolls are dangerous enough... I have heard they are permanently killed only by fire or acid. I don't know a thing about the other creatures.~
@8832 = ~That is more of a question than you know, child.  Suffice it to say that a tiny rivvil like yourself would not wish to meet more of my kind.~
@8833 = ~Do you smell that?  Smells like lightning, but indoors?  That can't be right.  I think I remember. Look to the right... the machine making the storm...~
@8834 = ~Of course, my son.  Be safe. Remember... you have many years ahead to do all the things you wish, and you will have the wisdom, then, to deal with them.~
@8835 = ~Great!  So, anyway, there I was traveling through the Troll Hills, right?  I come across this large cavern, warm steam coming out of it and the forbidding smell of brimstone and such...~
@8836 = ~Thirty feet high he was, with a wingspan easily three times that!  Red as blood and eviler than a cockatrice in May!~
@8837 = ~This rune has had a special enchantment placed upon it, allowing a mage to cast a very special version of the Imprisonment spell. This item is specifically attuned to Lord Ketlaar Argrim, and will function against him and him alone.~
@8838 = ~This is a well-crafted locket, obviously made with care, and typical of keepsake items often given to loved ones. A minor enchantment has attempted to capture the likeness of both <CHARNAME> and Jaheira within, making it a thoughtful gift of remembrance. One side has suffered some smudging, but it is a sweet gift nonetheless.~
@8839 = ~Don't look at me like that.  I want to work here.  In Trademeet, all employees are treated fairly... that's Waukeen's rule: fair trade.  It's good coin for an independent woman, you know.~
@8840 = ~I would be careful with that sharp tone, rivvil, lest you lose the tongue that shapes it.  Fortunately, I've no particular need of your slophouse and its stench of sweat.~
@8841 = ~Papa!  Papa!  Smelly is threatening me again, he is!  Threatening!~
@8842 = ~Whaaat?!  THIS be the Korgan you speak of, Mencar?!  Smaeluv will ring down righteous blows upon this dwarf for his foulness!!~
@8843 = ~OooOOOps!  Smelly's getting mad, papa!  Smelly's getting mad!~
@8844 = ~That's it.  I'm not dying for your simple stupidity, Mencar.  Brennan Risling has better things to do than court your arrogant pride...~
@8845 = ~A rousing wave of indifference from the crowd yet again.  Ah well, if I let such things bother me I would have given up the stage years ago...~
@8846 = ~... as per the wishes of most of my audience, unfortunately.  At least the occasional dwarf applauds. Well, doesn't swear and leave, anyway.~
@8847 = ~"Raised of spells and casting well, but always wanting better, 
To sing of knights and days of yore, to leave the robes that... that fetter!
A wizard prone to song and prose, though oft accused of failing,
I shall sing despite the odds..."~
@8848 = ~Will you shut yer bloody wailing!~
@8849 = ~Well finished,  Missus Patricia, you've a fine ear for rhyme, though... I would hope you'd be more supportive of your own employees...~
@8850 = ~I support you sticking to spells and figures.  You are security and a financial advisor, not the entertainment.  Hit the road if you want a forum for your singing!~
@8851 = ~Freeing the djinn.

I have retrieved the flask from the dryads... all that remains now is to go back to the genie and return it to him.~
@8852 = ~Get the golem to open the dungeon doors.

With the activation stone in my possession, the sewage golem has agreed to go about its duties... among which is the opening of the magically sealed doors in this level of the dungeon.~
@8853 = ~Collect the fee for Gaelan Bayle.

I have given Gaelan Bayle the gold he asked for, and in return he has given me a key which will admit me to see the head of the Athkatlan Shadow Thieves.  I am to go to the thieves' guild, it seems, and use the key on a secret entrance which is immediately to the right as I enter.~
@8854 = ~Find proof of Mae'Var's treachery.

I have killed Mae'Var, although I did it without the evidence that Renal needed and without his approval.  Even though I got the job done, Renal was not pleased with my performance.~
@8855 = ~You again? Have you coin to spend or are you just loitering?~
@8856 = ~You would be foolish to spurn her gifts, but it is your life to take in your hands as you see fit.~
@8857 = ~Solve the 'skinner' murders in the Bridge District.

While I was not able to catch Rejiek Hidesman, I have at least stopped his reign of terror in Athkatla and sent him fleeing.  The matter of Lieutenant Aegisfield, the guard who I inadvertently sent to his death, has also been dealt with.  I wonder if this ends, now, or if I will meet this disgusting murderer once again.~
@8858 = ~A spirited jig it dances bright, banishing all but darkest night. Give it food and it will live; give it water and it will die.~
@8859 = ~The life I lead is mere hours or less, I serve all my time by being consumed. I am quickest when thin, slowest when fat, and wind is the bane of the gift that I bring.~
@8860 = ~They come to witness the night without being called, a sailor's guide and a poet's tears. They are lost to sight each day without the hand of a thief.~
@8861 = ~They follow and lead, but only as you pass. Dress yourself in darkest black, and they are darker still. Always they flee the light, though without the sun there would be none.~
@8862 = ~I am free for the taking through all of your life, though given but once at birth. I am less than nothing in weight, but will fell the strongest of you if held.~
@8863 = ~Alive as you but without breath, as cold in my life as in my death; never a thirst though I always drink, dressed in a mail but never a clink.~
@8864 = ~Help Vittorio collect his debt.

A drunken man by the name of Vittorio had asked me to assist him in recovering a debt from a Captain Dennis... who, it appears, was owed much by Vittorio, himself.  Regardless, Captain Dennis and his men ended up dead in the inn for all their bluster and the drunken lout beat a hasty retreat.~
@8865 = ~Locate a caretaker for the orphan, Risa.

I managed to bring together two people who I met in the Graveyard District... a paladin named Kamir whose son had died and a little girl named Risa whose parents had died.  The paladin agreed to raise the girl and they left together.~
@8866 = ~No sense to be had. Let us see how far into the strangeness you can stride. Answer me this, and decide where you end.~
@8867 = ~It does, though not enough. One last word-play to see if you think as we. Then you shall get what you could not have had.~
@8868 = ~It is better than the best of things and worse than the worst of things.  You love it more than life.  You fear it more than death.  The rich have need of it, and the poor have it in endless supply.~
@8869 = ~Gain the services of Sir Sarles for the temple.

I managed to secure the services of the artist, Sir Sarles, for the church... although it was certainly not easy.  He had demanded to use pure illithium, which I had to obtain from a murderous dwarf named Neb.  Still, the task is done.~
@8870 = ~Another mission for the temple.

I have retrieved the Dawn Ring from Borinall and brought it to its rightful place in the Temple of Talos... my superiors were very pleased with my actions.~
@8871 = ~A failure in your fathoming of the task at hand. The question is done, as are your wanderings in the secret places.~
@8872 = ~Edwin is being hunted by the Red Wizards?

A Red Wizard by the name of Degardan managed to turn Edwin back into a man... which should forestall his complaints at least temporarily.  Edwin turned on the mage, naturally, as soon as he was exposed.  Why the Red Wizards are hunting Edwin remains a mystery.~
@8873 = ~A failure. Unfortunate, though the loss is hard to measure when you do not know your starting point.~
@8874 = ~I make you weak at the worst of all times, but in the end I keep you safe. You'll sweat in my presence even as you grow cold. I dwell with the weak, rarely the brave, but without me, who could tell the difference?~
@8875 = ~The machine has 6 levers arrayed on a console. They are Ruby, Jade, Mithril, Onyx, Emerald, and Sandalwood. The machine can only be activated by pulling all six levers in the proper ranking.~
@8876 = ~A success that moves you towards goals you cannot know. Does it satisfy? Who can say?~
@8877 = ~Your thoughts are clear and flowing, and free you are from here. Onward, to places secret and rewarding.~
@8878 = ~Yes, onward, and leave this festive place. You will see the unknown, and if willing, receive its gifts.~
@8879 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I found Mook at the docks, who reported to me seeing a man pass by several times, casing the place.  When he appeared again, she challenged him... and he killed her.  We defeated the man... or whatever he is... and he turned into mist before our eyes, cursing us as he fled.

No doubt that this would classify as an 'occurrence' that Aran might wish to know about in the morning.~
@8880 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I informed Aran Linvail of the events on the docks, and he is even more concerned than before.  His next task for me is to go to the top floor of the Five Flagons Inn in the Bridge District... there I will find two Shadow Thieves named Jaylos and Caehan who plan to defect to the rival guild.

Perhaps I can pretend to be another recruit, just as they are. If all goes as planned I might even fool their contact as well. Hopefully I will get the location of the rival guild's headquarters and then Aran can stop them from disrupting his people. Then we can get to the business of finding Imoen. He seems sincere in this.~
@8881 = ~Here begins the tests of madness, of sanity and clarity. Presented with nonsense how will you proceed?~
@8882 = ~The contact and your thieves are dead. A letter spoke of the Graveyard District.~
@8883 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

While my information was of use to Aran, it appears he had a few other sources as well. The rival guild's leader, named Bodhi, is most certainly a vampire... and my investigation has confirmed that she and her undead minions can be found in the network of tombs beneath the Graveyard District.

I am to go to these tombs and destroy Bodhi and her guild.  I am to receive assistance from a mage and his golem who will open an unmovable set of blue doors that are just north of a nest of spiders in the underground tomb.  The final assault on these vampires will occur there, and Aran has given me four wooden stakes with which to put these vampires to their final rest.~
@8884 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have defeated the rival guild, full of vampires as it was, and have faced Bodhi. She claimed to know something of Imoen and seemed to be judging me in some manner before she left in gaseous form.  All that remains now is to return to Aran and tell him that the guild is gone, even if their leader remains unkilled. I will have questions for him as well.

One more troubling thing... Bodhi knew. She knew I am a child of Bhaal.~
@8885 = ~Aran's tasks to receive the Shadow Thieves' aid.

I have completed the tasks Aran Linvail set out for me, and at last the location of Imoen has been revealed.  This did not come, mind you, without some revelations.

The Shadow Thieves have been interested in me from the beginning. They were aware of my capture, but thought it nothing more than a simple kidnapping and none of their business. However, soon after that Bodhi appeared and their members started disappearing. They thought another guild was converting them, making a bid for control of the city's underground, and directed an attack against what they thought was the guild headquarters, Irenicus' dungeon below Waukeen's. 

They were totally unprepared for how strong Irenicus was. After the battle they set their sights on me, because I was the only thing that came out of that dungeon alive. Since I was of such interest to Irenicus they needed to know what I was up to. Once they realized that Irenicus was a threat to us both, they sought to aid me, while also aiding themselves. Their intentions were good, despite their selfish motive.

They believe that Irenicus is still very much a threat.  Both Irenicus and Imoen have been taken to an island asylum called Spellhold where mages are imprisoned and studied.  And yet it sounds doubtful that Irenicus has been so easily overcome.  Bodhi and her rival guild are tied to him in some manner... and his purpose in studying both myself and Imoen is still unknown.

Imoen still remains in that place, however.  The Shadow Thieves have arranged a ship to take me to the isle at no small expense, hoping in that retrieving Imoen I might rid them of their other problem, as well.  Whatever happens, I am sure my biggest challenge yet awaits me on this isle.~
@8886 = ~I will battle you to the last!~
@8887 = ~I will arrange suitable punishment for your outburst. You will find that such obstinacy is painful, and that your path becomes more difficult.~
@8888 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

In return for allowing me within their base, I am required to perform a small task for the Harpers.  There is a small house in the center of the district, the home of a mage named Prebek. Within are supposed to be creatures of some kind... the result of someone's experiments.  I am to kill these creatures and return.~
@8889 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

I have been admitted to the Harper base... but Rylock warns me I must keep to the first floor.  If I go to the second floor, I will be killed, and he implied that not even the Harpers could stop that from happening.~
@8890 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

In conversation with the Harpers, it was mentioned that the second floor is protected by guardians of some nature... who would not recognize me as a Harper and were very dangerous.~
@8891 = ~You have answered madness with inaccuracy, a dangerous thing to do. If you do not understand the ravings, best that you ignore them.~
@8892 = ~Find out what happened to Montaron.

The guardians on the second floor do not seem to attack those who are wearing the harper amulets.  I asked about Montaron, but all I got as a response was that 'those who defile Harper soil are forbidden to touch it.  They are above the soil, that they might see it and know loss.'  ... whatever that means.~
@8893 = ~Here, among the filth and bile of the mire where your hostility and foolishness has lead you, what do you see?~
@8894 = ~Anyone could take what they wished from here. Better it was fenced in.~
@8895 = ~Turnips! I see fine soil that could keep a man in tubers for life. Of course, I guess it's more for <CHARNAME> to say.~
@8896 = ~Your voice does well enough. Wisdom and clarity speak well of sanity. Your path is somewhat easier now. Proceed.~
@8897 = ~I offer civilized discourse and you counter with obstinacy. Unfortunate. Your path is the hard one.~
@8898 = ~And if the market were to close? You show an unwillingness to change. Not good. The path will be a little harder.~
@8899 = ~Far too dismissive. You show inflexibility. Not desirable. The path will be harder still.~
@8900 = ~A simple task. You are quick of foot, and respond well. I applaud, though my approval means little.~
@8901 = ~Who can say. It has been quite some time since the process has been refined. Really, I do not think you were intended to survive.~
@8902 = ~You have failed to measure up to the standards I have applied. A final test then, to determine your worth.~
@8903 = ~Defeat a creature of mind, the embodiment of control over the mental. Do this, and you shall perhaps see the light of day.~
@8904 = ~This place is a momentary relapse. It has little to do with the testing. That you found your way here at all is interesting.~
@8905 = ~I shall raze the entire building to this condition.~
@8906 = ~The path is made easier, though not totally without hazard.~
@8907 = ~Unproductive. You are not responding to these evaluations well at all. Would that I had a director here to study you properly.~
@8908 = ~As it stands I can only discourage the thoughts. The path gets harder.~
@8909 = ~I suppose this view is unavoidable, since I reinforce it by subjecting you to the tests in the first.~
@8910 = ~Then we shall proceed to your evaluation.~
@8911 = ~As you would.~
@8912 = ~Are you through just yet? We must proceed to judgement.~
@8913 = ~Save Jaheira from Baron Ployer's curse.

We have run into an old 'friend' of Jaheira's... a man named Baron Ployer who was a slaver that Jaheira ruined in the course of her Harper activities.  The man has obviously been plotting his revenge, as he has created some manner of curse which he has laid on Jaheira... and which he claims will kill her.~
@8914 = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

I have found Jaheira once again at the Harper Hold in Athkatla, and she has rejoined the party so that we may go together to present ourselves before the Harpers... for what reason, I still do not know.~
@8915 = ~Summoned to the Harper Hold.

I presented myself before the Harpers at their base and discovered that I was there only to bolster the ambitions of a man by the name of Galvarey.  Imprisoning the 'child of Bhaal' to restore the balance, as he claimed, would improve his position amongst the Harpers and bolster his chance of obtaining the position of Herald.
Jaheira had apparently brought me there to show Galvarey my true nature, but the decision had obviously already been made.  She was upset, but could not take arms against her own kind.  She fled as I fought against Galvarey and his fellow Harpers.  I won... but Jaheira is now gone.~
@8916 = ~Jaheira renounces her Harper status.

We have met with yet another Harper... this one, apparently, a former tutor of Jaheira's by the name of Dermin.  He told Jaheira that he was sent to execute her for the deaths at the Harper Hold, and while he did not attack, Jaheira renounced her life as a Harper in anger over the injustice.~
@8917 = ~Jaheira renounces her Harper status.

We have met with another Harper... this one, apparently, a former tutor of Jaheira's by the name of Dermin.  He told Jaheira that he was sent to execute her for the deaths at the Harper Hold, and while he did not attack, Jaheira renounced her life as a Harper in anger over the injustice of it all.  She was so wrapped up in the gravity of her decision that she blew up when I urged us to continue on and left for good.  Perhaps just as well, considering all the trouble she brought me.~
@8918 = ~The Harper plot revealed.

The plot with the Harpers has finally come clear... Galvarey was not a true Harper at all, simply an opportunist who used his position to gain power.  Jaheira's former mentor was one of his compatriots, and both were counting on the fact that my own status as a child of Bhaal would make any accusations made against me believable.

One must wonder if the rest of the Harpers will continue their vendetta against Jaheira and I.~
@8919 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

Well, Jan Jansen's fine has been paid to the jailkeep... who was eager enough to see the garrulous gnome leave that he lent me 200 gp.  He does expect to be paid back, though.  I suppose the only thing to do now is to tell Jan he's free.~
@8920 = ~Free Jan Jansen from prison.

The jailkeep who lent me the 200 gp toward Jan's fine has been paid back.~
@8921 = ~Jan Jansen returns to his home in the slums.

I managed to get a garrulous con-artist gnome out of a jam with the local authorities, and he has offered to join my party in the future should I wish to track him down at his home in the slums.  Selling turnips, he said... but somehow I doubt that.~
@8922 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured of her illness... but even after all that, Jan's sweetheart Lissa decided to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag.  Jan has sworn to take vengeance on the gnome if he ever hears of him hurting her again... but for now, he has rejoined my party.~
@8923 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured of her illness... but even after all that, Jan's sweetheart Lissa decided to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag.  Jan is broken-hearted, to say the least, and does not wish to remain at home... so he has rejoined my party once again.~
@8924 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

The young girl, Jaella, has been cured... but even after all that, Lissa has agreed to return to her cruel husband, Vaelag.  Jan is broken-hearted and wanted to return to my group, but I told him that it is best if he remains at home for a while.  Jan will be available in the future, should I have need of him.~
@8925 = ~Jan returns home to help his former love, Lissa.

Lissa's daughter, Jaella, is dead... a cure could not be found in time to save her from her illness.  Lissa has left Jan's home and the dispirited, sad gnome seems more than willing to rejoin the party just to be away from there.~
@8926 = ~Yoshimo escapes the dungeon on his own.

I met a thief in this dark place who named himself Yoshimo.  I didn't trust him enough to take him with me, but he did say that if I get out of this dungeon (as does he), that I should try and find him, perhaps at the closest tavern.~
@8927 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn has come to the conclusion that he is to blame... and I have urged him to leave my companionship and attempt a reconciliation with her.  I wonder if I shall see him again?~
@8928 = ~Keldorn dies defending Sir William.

Keldorn's odd sense of justice and honor forced him to defend Sir William, the very man whom his own wife has been betraying him with.  Now, the Lady Maria is not only an adulteress, but a widow as well.~
@8929 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife, Maria, had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn decided that it was he who was at fault... and sought a reconciliation. Keldorn promised to resign from the Order, and I urged him to spend a week with his family, rebuilding their relationship... after which Keldorn told me that I could find him at his estate once again.~
@8930 = ~Keldorn returns to his wife and family.

After discovering that his wife, Maria, had taken up with another man during his long absences, Keldorn came to the decision that it was he who was to blame.  He has reconciled with his wife, promising that his mission with me shall be his last and that after he returns he shall resign from the Order... a promise which she has accepted.~
@8931 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn's wife had betrayed him by spending time with another man during his absences... and while he might feel otherwise, the only proper thing for Keldorn to do was to bring both her and her lover to justice.~
@8932 = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn took vengeance upon the man with whom his wife had betrayed him.  As a result, Maria has left Keldorn and taken her children with him.  The knight is devastated, obviously... but claims he is ready to return to my company so he can forget about these events.~
@8933 = ~Spend not a coin now, then.  Seek your fortune about the town, but remember that here is where your help is. Strangers are not always to be feared.~
@8934 = ~I'd check the Five Flagons in the Bridge district if you are looking for bardic work. There's a playhouse downstairs.~
@8935 = ~She us'd t' be called the Yawnin' Mary but she din't exactly strike fear into th' 'earts o' our victims.~
@8936 = ~What's dat? Aye, I be a salt-encrusted citizen of the High Seas, I be, an' a ten-times survivor of the scurvy wastin'.~
@8937 = ~Argh, I won't lie t' ye. We come fro' Baldur's Gate. Sailors we wuz but pirates we'll be! Unfortunate business with our employer, ye understand.~

@8944 = ~'Twas a nice town before the filthy pirates moved in. Scoundrels! A man's children aren't safe around that sea filth.~
@8945 = ~I hope Desharik's men move out soon. They're tearing up the town in an orgy of drunkness.~
@8946 = ~I hate fish. I hate fishing. I hate pirates. I hate this climate!~
@8947 = ~Why don't you find employment? Am I a charity to be hounded by the unwashed?~
@8948 = ~I am... employed, <SIRMAAM>. (sob)  I can't bear to have another drunken pirate pawing me in a dark room! But I need at least a coin... he'll hurt Ason!~
@8949 = ~Very well. Here is a coin. Dry your tears, I must be off.~
@8950 = ~I'm afraid that I have no money to spare.~
@8951 = ~I should begin with my name... Ginia. I grew up here in Brynnlaw. My father was a tailor until he was killed, and my mother is long dead.~
@8952 = ~I have no time to listen to the rest of this. Perhaps another time.~
@8953 = ~They took our homes. Desharik killed our mayor and dumped his body into the sea. We were forced out into the streets.~
@8954 = ~Desharik said that we would have to pay for our father's 'crime'. He gave us to Chremy, his lieutenant, as a reward for service.~
@8955 = ~He put me to work as a courtesan for the drunken pirates. It's horrible, <SIRMAAM>! He says that he'll kill my brother Ason if I don't do it.~
@8956 = ~What's the point, <SIRMAAM>. If Chremy dies, you will only get in trouble and Desharik will just give us to someone else ... or kill us.~
@8957 = ~Chremy can be found near the inn. The smuggler's name is Calahan. He will be near the docks. Thank you for your offer but please be careful!~
@8958 = ~He is dead. You and Ason should go to see Calahan immediately. He will put you on the next ship to Ulgoth's Beard.~
@8959 = ~Don't I know you?~
@8960 = ~I just wanted to see if our deal is still on. Will you take care of Ason and Ginia?~
@8961 = ~Calahan don't be owin' ye money, do he?~
@8962 = ~I judge by actions. You seem harmless enough, really.~
@8963 = ~Darnta be a fool. This here town is owned by pirates. Ye wouldn't be here unless yer foolish or a criminal in yer own right. When in Thesk, do as the Theskians do an' all dat.~
@8964 = ~Flee you from my home, will you. Honest citizen I am. Just a dwarf trying to make a living.~
@8965 = ~Is your name Neb?~
@8966 = ~A sad, sad tale 'ti that ye're about to here. Mistress Malory got it into her 'ead that Calahan was spreading malicious rumors 'bout her.~
@8967 = ~I admit that I may o' been a bit free with th' tongue-waggin' but 'tisn't like my stories be untrue. Malory has... connections on account o' her... activities.~
@8968 = ~Then we be agree'n. Their passage is assured if ye can get them away from that bastard Chremy. Send 'em to ol' Calahan when ye've got things arranged.~
@8969 = ~Well... are we to separate on this note?~ [JANJAN82]
@8970 = ~We must continue our travels.~ [ANOMENC8]

@8972 = ~That's a horrible thing to say!  I am sure we have enough gold that we can spare a little... it makes a huge difference to them and your share won't be any the less!~
@8973 = ~Aye, lass.  It is a terrible thing to ponder.  But have we not done our part in ending this base tyranny?  Cling to that, if you can.~
@8974 = ~Heh... that's pretty funny, Korgan.~
@8975 = ~Th-they... they admit that they are slavers?!  This is disgusting!  We shall destroy you all, you disgusting men!~
@8976 = ~Ah, yes, the old puzzle-box trick.  Ma Jensen used to hide the keys to the breadbox the same way, not that it ever stopped us.  "Jan," she used to say, "one of these days you're going to have one too many sweetbreads!"  I never did, although my cousin Arfie once did and that day he exploded.  Sad story, that.~
@8977 = ~Are you sure it's your rodent, Minsc?  I once felt excitement before impending doom fell upon me, and it turned out later to be a mild case of indigestion.  You should get that checked, you know... I was laid out for weeks in bed, eating nothing but ice cream and porridge, and we wouldn't want you turning into a chubby berserker, now would we?~
@8978 = ~Well... I've heard of this Lord Jierdan, <CHARNAME>, if it's any help.  He has the coin to back up his offer.  He's not reputed to be the nicest noble in Amn, but then who is?~
@8979 = ~I... I don't know, Jaheira, I've heard about this Lord Jierdan.  He's brutal; it's not like him to be so protective of his people.  I don't like the sound of this.~
@8980 = ~So, you want me back do you?~ [EDWIN91]
@8981 = ~No, don't leave.~
@8982 = ~<CHARNAME>, you should think on this for a moment.  This is the only one who can attest to our innocence.  I doubt the Order will believe our story without his aid.~
@8983 = ~For once I agree with the addled ranger.  I dislike being manipulated and would be interested in Lord Jierdan's reasons, though I care nothing about a rescue.~
@8984 = ~Oh... so this is why they want your body.  To get inside that sphere and... and take its treasure.  We... we can't support this, <CHARNAME>!~
@8985 = ~Ooo, there's none so desirable a trinket as one you cannot see. Are you sure I can't just have a peek or two?~
@8986 = ~I am not certain I would find your wares palatable regardless. I suspect they are ill-got in origin.~
@8987 = ~Hah!  A liar exposed for the fraud that he is!  To use such an excuse as an ill mother only to be revealed... it sickens my stomach to witness such base cunning.~
@8988 = ~No doubt you are deserving of your punishment, though this place is probably far emptier than it should be...~
@8989 = ~Heh... I do believe you've just been forced into committing an act of charity, <CHARNAME>.~
@8990 = ~Silver Sword
This Vorpal Silver Sword radiates a dark aura when you examine it, and the blade is so finely sharpened it could likely sever a head in a single blow.

@8991 = ~Rooftops! I would slide along the odd wall but never had the will to go higher.~
@8992 = ~I do not share that name! I would be against the lot of you were our association not dire necessity.~
@8993 = ~You have proven yourself to be a person of few morals. I'm happy that I am leaving.~ [MAZZY95]
@8994 = ~I would have liked to stay. Please, at least, avenge my friends and destroy the Shade Lord. I shall return to my home in Trademeet. Farewell and good luck.~
@8995 = ~You there!  Struttin' around in yer fancy armor!  Why doesn't ye go do something useful and gather up all the street thieves and cutpurses, eh?!~
@8996 = ~So... what's your deal with Haer'Dalis, anyway?~
@8997 = ~Eh... well, that's between he and I, my <LADYLORD>, and I'll thank you not to ask me about it further.~
@8998 = ~Someone let a dark elf in here?!  What, are we just gonna let this happen?  Come on, everyone... jump her!  Come on!~
@8999 = ~Samuel... Samuel Thunderburp.  Greatest fighter of Highdale and renowned rapscallion.  Yes, indeed, it has been a long time.~
@9000 = ~How have you been faring, then?  Last I heard, you had hooked up with Patrick and his band up in... what?  Trademeet?  Did you all part ways?~
@9001 = ~That's good.  Well, I have you to thank, <CHARNAME>, for saving my favorite halfling paladin.  Here, a pair of my old adventuring boots.  More use to you than I.~
@9002 = ~Monks cannot use two-handed weapons.~
@9003 = ~Ach, I see ye've given up the sale of turnips, gnome.  A sad thing, I always cared for yer turnips... fresh as anythin', 'ey were.~
@9004 = ~Raising... raising babies?  I... I just started seeing something of the world beyond the circus.  One step at a time is good enough for me!~
@9005 = ~Sir Keldorn, is that you?  How wonderful to see you!  How are your two sweet girls... fine, I hope?~
@9006 = ~Yup.  You just wait... I'll be renowned as the greatest halfling sorcerer around Faerun in years to come!  Just you wait!~
@9007 = ~Never said you had to leave the bar, just don't bother me. Plenty of room for everyone.~
@9008 = ~(sniff)  Ahh, even Boo cringes from such a foul odor.  Surely this instrument will never make beautiful music again.~
@9009 = ~Ew... ewwww, <CHARNAME>, put something over it, at least!  Acch, I had enough of these stenches when I was in the circus!  (cough! cough!)~
@9010 = ~Sorry, I must have confused you with someone else.~
@9011 = ~Isaea Roenall. Certainly you know him.~
@9012 = ~You killed Captain Haegan! You were clearly described to me! Come for another slaver, have you? Well, I'll not go without a fight!~
@9013 = ~Barg? Sorry, but I've no scraps to give you. Tell that soused fool to stop sending beggars my way.~
@9014 = ~Well, indeed I do know Isaea Roenall. I know him well enough that he would never tell our dealings to another person!~
@9015 = ~Who are you! Some trussed-up guard trying to trick me? Trying to con yourself a slaver?~
@9016 = ~Our mutual friend, Isaea Roenall.~
@9017 = ~I do not support this Vittorio's actions, but I cannot stand by and watch him hurt.  If we do not look for this... this gong... then we must stop the Captain from exacting vengeance.~
@9018 = ~Ahhhh, I can see the bards singing it, now: the Quest for the Gong!  The life of a drunkard lies in the balance as <CHARNAME> and his band of merry adventurers strive to retrieve fenced stolen musical goods from the depths of the sewers!  The passion!  The excitement!  It brings a tear to my eye.  (sniff!)  Not since Uncle Gerhardt went on a four-day turnip beer bender and mistook Uncle Scratchy for a griffon was I ever part of such a grandiose story.~
@9019 = ~Take no mind of her, <CHARNAME>. Always been a bit surly to newcomers... I'm sure.~
@9020 = ~Chaos~
@9021 = ~Harsh justice indeed. Perhaps death was deserved, but in this manner?~
@9022 = ~The call of the Druid is never easy and your tasks are but beginning. The Grove will extend its blessing to you if you will take up the mantle of leadership.~
@9023 = ~Save your trickery of words, beggar. The weak are not deserving of charity.~
@9024 = ~<CHARNAME>! How could you turn your back on the less fortunate? They deserve our help.~
@9025 = ~Madness! The singleminded nature of the Rashemeni but with even less sense!~
@9026 = ~<CHARNAME>, please avoid tempting the gods of darkness. I search for favor, but not at such a cost to my soul.~
@9027 = ~I have little doubt, <CHARNAME>, that we will also find Lieutenant Aegisfield somewhere herein... hopefully the man is still alive.~
@9028 = ~Ahah! I knew there had to be reinforcements down here. Couldn't be that powerful by himself, I said!~ [GENMG06]
@9029 = ~You can talk all you wish, but it will do you no good. Everyone in this place has either attacked or tried to lie their way into my confidence.~
@9030 = ~I understand none of this, but if the one who killed Dynaheir is beyond, Boo and Minsc will make short work of you!~
@9031 = ~Nilthiri even now performs ceremonies of summoning. She must be stopped. You will find her along the path to the east of the Troll Mound.~
@9032 = ~I make no illusions about what will be required of you. I will wish you to kill, and I will wish you to terrorize. You must determine if you have the stomach for it.~
@9033 = ~You are needed beyond the confines of the Grove and should go for a time. But let not too many weeks pass before you return to the Grove. You may be needed here again soon.~
@9034 = ~Child of Nature, you are again needed. Balance is threatened and Chaos is at the periphery. Will you serve the Grove?~
@9035 = ~Please, this is pointless. I am the better choice. I will give you free reign to do as you will. You will be a force to be feared.~
@9036 = ~He brought druids from across the lands to stop the encroachment of 'progress' from the 'civilized' races.~
@9037 = ~Oh, were you expecting some great battle while I yelled curses at you? That will come, but not in here. Remove yourselves.~
@9038 = ~I will take the 15,000 gold now, of course. It is secondary to my concerns, but that was the deal. Now to my tasks.~
@9039 = ~<CHARNAME>, this is a delicate matter, and it *does* involve the guild we are fighting. You will realize this in time.~
@9040 = ~Now, as Marek knew would someday happen, his descendants have returned and old enemies marshal their forces. A child called Loren has recently arrived in Trademeet.~
@9041 = ~This child is the inheritor of Marek's spirit but does not yet have the knowledge to use his power. Surely he shall be slain by the forces of chaos if you do not rescue him.~
@9042 = ~Mook is dead but the shipment is safe. Now I want what I paid for.~
@9043 = ~Marek is the strength within you, boy. You must fight against the voices. You must cast them out from your body and I shall do battle with them.~
@9044 = ~Marek is the strength within you, boy. His spirit still protects you. You must fight against the voices. You must cast them out from your body and I shall do battle with them.~
@9045 = ~He is ours! Cursed Marek thought to fight us but we are the Dark Power, the Eternal Power of nature's chaos. We cannot be defeated! The boy will not follow in Marek's footsteps!~
@9046 = ~We will need assistance opening it then.~
@9047 = ~I have spoken with... the Spirit.  I want to become a druid, I guess. It said that I will protect the Grove when you have moved on... that I have a destiny, here.~
@9048 = ~I'm on my way, but you had better come through with your part of the bargain.~
@9049 = ~We knew of your capture almost as soon as it happened. Very little occurs in this city that we are not aware of.~
@9050 = ~But soon after that we started losing people. That was when Bodhi appeared, though we did not know her name at the time.~
@9051 = ~The Grove senses a dark destiny ahead of you, with much danger both moral and physical. For now your task is done in the Grove.~
@9052 = ~We had to be sure. We could not let an enemy into the guild when we are so weakened. In truth, your gold was much needed as well.~
@9053 = ~We thought you could lead us to him, and you can. You seek Imoen and Irenicus, and we seek answers. They were taken to the same place, you see.~
@9054 = ~Let an old man gripe, son.~
@9055 = ~Or we have mistakenly wandered amidst the dirty and reprehensible.~
@9056 = ~This will not come to pass in my presence. This young woman is not to be bought and sold like chattel.~
@9057 = ~(cough)... there are... too many... Go back!~
@9058 = ~The deeper you get within the keep, the more trolls and yuan-ti you'll find.  Open the bridge and we will engage them. It may be your only chance.~
@9059 = ~Hah!  Look at th' mealy-faced one o'er there... ye looks like ye couldn't hold yer own in a tussle with a wet sack, robed one!~
@9060 = ~If that comment was for me, I suggest you rethink it before I have you begging at my feet for mercy.  (Hmph!  'Mealy-faced'!  I am as vital as I ever was!)~
@9061 = ~<CHARNAME> is taking a chance by <PRO_HISHER> action... but compassion must be granted to even the least of our brethren.  Would you not have the Order take a chance on you, hm?~
@9062 = ~Your blood cools, and mind and body are reunited under your control. Your will had faltered, and the essence of Bhaal was there to take advantage.~
@9063 = ~Finally: the Shadowmaster.  This is real power we're going to meet, now, <CHARNAME>, so you'd best reign in your temperamental nature.~
@9064 = ~Here, mousey mousey, the hunt draws to a close here and now.~ [BODHIX35]
@9065 = ~Hardly. It is a mere formality. Should the Amnish army ever come to investigate Windspear's fall from grace, my ownership of the deed would stop an annoying battle.~
@9066 = ~The reward will be of my choosing. The task is hardly difficult. Garren is old and beaten already.~
@9067 = ~Very well. Go to Garren Windspear and find the Deed to the Windspear Hills. I care not whether he lives or dies. Conster! Go and take care of the child. They are no longer needed. <CHARNAME>, return when you have the deed.~
@9068 = ~The Harpers aren't likely to tell us what happened to his spy willingly... but they might answer some questions since we, ah, helped with that other man.~
@9069 = ~Thank you, Master Irenicus.~
@9070 = ~You may be disappointed, but I am well pleased. My servants have proven to be artists with herbs, as well with deception. Your meals aboard ship were prepared exactly to my specifications.~
@9071 = ~Fools! The Master will brook no incompetence! You are to clean his favorite golems and you do work too poorly!  The Master is furious!  He values his golems more than a hundred of you!!~
@9072 = ~No, you have been usurped from within. Not all in my care were there completely against their will. Yoshimo has certainly proven his worth, with some encouragement.~
@9073 = ~And if not he, then Saemon Havarian sealed your fate. Either way, you have already lost.~
@9074 = ~Gerg not ready to die in stinkhole like this! I leave!~
@9075 = ~I would not advise it, Jaheira. The guardians may not recognize you without the proper... protection. It is best not to disturb them without a most vital reason.~
@9076 = ~It was his suggestion, really. A fine way to retrieve you unharmed. Of course, your safety is no longer a concern at this point.~ [IRENIC44]
@9077 = ~No, you have been usurped from within. Not all in my care were there against their will. Yoshimo has certainly proven his worth.~
@9078 = ~I guess... if we can stand up to him. We're both pretty weak after what he did... to us both.~
@9079 = ~<CHARNAME>, he showed me what you are and... what I am. And then he took it away.~
@9080 = ~He took something vital... he says it was my divine soul? I find out I'm a child of a god and now I'm empty and dying. You are too...~
@9081 = ~We'll survive by helping each other, like you helped me in the dream during the spell.~
@9082 = ~Retrieving the deed for the Windspear Hills.

I have made a deal with Firkraag the dragon. If I retrieve the Deed to the Windspear Hills from Garren Windspear and return it to Firkraag, I shall be rewarded.~
@9083 = ~Bring your wrath to bear if you are so sure. I doubt you will outlive the tenday regardless. I will not bother with excuses, I cannot fight his spells.~ [YOSHIM67]
@9084 = ~No redemptions,  no second chances... let us get this over with! I stride into the hell that Irenicus promised! Ilmater take my heart, I have no choice!~ [YOSHIM68]
@9085 = ~I am bleak, I know, but I was all alone here for so long. I have not dealt with this for as long as you. It's like a bad dream.~
@9086 = ~If your whining husband is dead, druid, it is nothing to do with me... and as for answers, you must go much higher than I to be satisfied.~
@9087 = ~I dislike this role of assassin, <CHARNAME>.  To name a Cowled Wizard an innocent, however, would be laughably naive.  Let us proceed with the task, if you are determined.~
@9088 = ~And yet you seemed so sure of yourself when you helped in my dream.~
@9089 = ~I don't know. Regardless, we have to get back what Irenicus took from us.~
@9090 = ~I hope so. I don't look forward to what is ahead though. We face one doozy of a threat to our mortal selves, divine soul or not.~
@9091 = ~If we don't reverse what was done... if we don't restore our souls... we will probably both die.~
@9092 = ~Pfeh.  If it be a struggle between conscience and gold, I can count on one of me hands the number of seconds 'twould take to resolve such a dispute.  Begone with yer blather, girl.~
@9093 = ~Good enough for me. Go.~
@9094 = ~Rashemen is my home, but I haven't seen it for many moons.  I am on my dajemma.  I... failed my last witch... but nothing will happen to Aerie!  Nothing!~
@9095 = ~Very well. I don't mean to be rude. Things are not done with such abruptness and selfishness in our town. Thank you and goodbye.~
@9096 = ~As you will. In this area, you will have to find a sun gem to pass one of the shadow doors. Be careful! Once you take it off of the altar, its light will no longer protect you from the shadows.~
@9097 = ~We can't just leave him.  Well, we should at least find who he's talking about or... or find him some help?  Please, <CHARNAME>?  We can't just let someone die...~
@9098 = ~A fate, as they say, worse than death, and one that has not gone unnoticed by your comrades.~
@9099 = ~A fate, as they say, that is worse than death, unless you find Irenicus and take back what is yours.~
@9100 = ~Har har!!  That Thayvian blood of yours runs as hot as I've heard, wizard!  Yer a conqueror of the lasses, ye are!  Har har har!!~
@9101 = ~Yeah!  That old fish-King!  Pheee-eeeww!  No sense of humor!~
@9102 = ~I give to you this curved sword; I am too old to fight.  Give it to another warrior, one whose skin is black as night.~
@9103 = ~I am Khelben, a wizard of great power... one of the rulers of the finest city of the north.  I need the item that supplies my fondest name... and an extra leg as I walk forth.~
@9104 = ~I give to you this pipe of root and magic... its power is strong, I will not lie.  Bequeath it to a man, instead, one older even than I.~
@9105 = ~This shell rises from the depths of the pool. You are unsure as to what is supporting it.~
@9106 = ~I give you a helmet, here... a symbol, so I'm told, of rulership on the surface land in a city far North and cold.~
@9107 = ~A putrid wave of air rushes over you as you gaze about this hellish room. Rotting corpses of all shapes and sizes lie submerged in the bloody, stagnant water.~
@9108 = ~But... whaaaat isss thiiiissss?  I... I cannnnot rrrreeeeaaaach yyoouur liiifffe fffffoooorrrrce...~
@9109 = ~Okay... we might meet you there at a later date.~
@9110 = ~Brus mentioned a new deal. Is that the change he spoke of?~
@9111 = ~Aye, 15,000 gold. They wish to speed proceedings along, for your benefit and theirs. They want to keep the relationship with you as friendly as possible.~
@9112 = ~So ye be sure to return when you've the full 15,000. We can be good friends, the lot of us. We're on the same side in this, whether ye know it or not.~
@9113 = ~I'll pay the 15,000 right now.~
@9114 = ~I'm not ready to do this yet.~
@9115 = ~You've been warned... now suffer the consequences.~
@9116 = ~You're just sending him to the guard?  Obviously you haven't spent too much time in the city.  The garrison might be just as likely to re-bury the man to avoid having to write up a report about it.  It happened to my cousin Biffle, once, you know.  Some errant mage had cast an Earthquake spell and opened up a chasm that poor Biffle had fallen into.  A terrible sight to behold, especially since his entire tray of Aunt Gertie's turnip muffins flew into the chasm with him.  She had been hoping to win the local muffin baking contest, and we were all bereaved for weeks that Gertie hadn't gotten her due.  She'd been baking for weeks, you know.  Why she'd given the tray to Biffle no one could ever figure out... he was always suffering from one kind of bad luck or another, you'd have thought he'd offended the gods.  Tsk.  Hmmm... where was I?~
@9117 = ~You have your ransom, <CHARNAME>, but you could have avoided the inevitable reputation of a kidnapper.  Sometimes I think you act without due consideration.~
@9118 = ~Your distress wakes your companions, but they can only watch as your pain grows more intense.~
@9119 = ~My dear, are you all right? I will soothe you as best I can if need be.~
@9120 = ~Mind your business, drow, if you value your life!~
@9121 = ~Your lips move as a jester's, with no sound for me to hear. Do you mock me, <CHARNAME>? <CHARNAME>, do you hear me... no!~
@9122 = ~You are shivering, my dear. I will stoke the fire, though I fear your chill is not a fault of the air.~
@9123 = ~I have the head of a criminal here, a dwarf by the name of Neb.  Is it you that I should be talking to?~
@9124 = ~<CHARNAME>, I want to think this won't happen again. I *have* to think it won't. Please, let's get out of this place.~
@9125 = ~We must put a stop to this. Speak no more of it until we can face those responsible.~
@9126 = ~The pain comes in an instant, forcing you to double over. A quick check reveals no obvious injury or attacker, and with dread you realize the cause is within.~
@9127 = ~It passes quickly and you remain in control, but the dread of what could happen next time remains in your mind.~
@9128 = ~You are ignorant, even for a human.  Fortunately for you, Arvoreen calls for patience for such as you, or I would strike you down where you stand for such blasphemy.~
@9129 = ~Calm yourself, rivvil.  Or slice your own throat upon your knife, I truly do not care.  The amount of hysteria your kind experiences by my mere presence is laughable.~
@9130 = ~... Ah... I see... excuse me, please...~
@9131 = ~I would deal with you here, fool, but it would draw the Cowled Wizards' attention.  Count yourself lucky and be gone from my sight!~
@9132 = ~Now, there's no need to be rude.  It was just a simple story of furry feet and the foibles of being a teenaged gnome.  Ah, youth!  I still remember her laughter as she ate turnip cake after turnip cake... quite an appetite, as I recall.~
@9133 = ~Thanks for the oh-so-heartfelt concern, Viconia. Remind me to dance on your grave.~
@9134 = ~Strange... I just kind of felt like I wasn't in complete control for a moment there.~
@9135 = ~I see. Strange that Imoen seemed to have weathered the ritual better than you.~
@9136 = ~It's nothing, Aerie, I will be fine. Do not worry yourself.~
@9137 = ~I know of Sir Keldorn.  I do not doubt that he looks into this cult on his own.  He is a veteran paladin of the Order, a fine warrior... if somewhat arrogant and over-pious.~
@9138 = ~It felt like I wasn't in total control of myself for a moment. It has passed.~
@9139 = ~Excellent!  An adventure worthy of the name!~
@9140 = ~Your weakness is betrayed by the quiver in your voice, rivvil!  Your precious eye tyrant is so much dust and you shall join him before the hour is through!~
@9141 = ~Speak common, you deep-living freaks. I have no time for your nonsense!~
@9142 = ~Gordul! Ta jarge.~
@9143 = ~Ahh haha. (ahem) You must excuse my fellows. It is not often we encounter surfacers down here.~
@9144 = ~I do.~
@9145 = ~Mister Jansen again?  For the last time, the government will not erect a magical anti-griffon perimeter around the city.  They simply aren't a threat, so stop bothering us!~
@9146 = ~Wait...  that's a dark elf, isn't it? A dark elf tax was brought into being by the Council of 1107... all dark elves must pay a daily fee to remain in the city.~
@9147 = ~I paid my dues when rivvin attempted to burn me at the stake, elg'caress.  Ask me again to pay for the 'privilege' of visiting your city and you will forfeit your tongue.~
@9148 = ~Oh yes, those two. Bad news, I would wager. I've seen them near the Drow city. Must be up to dirty dealings; those ol morogh dark elves don't usually let strangers live.~
@9149 = ~Well then, I'll wish you luck, though you won't be able to simply walk into the Drow city.~
@9150 = ~I'll have a look. Let's see what you have.~
@9151 = ~Help us fight whatever creatures come through the portal, we shall give you the deed to the playhouse before we leave. You are a bard and shall use it well.~
@9152 = ~Of... of course. L'elend zhah alurl. I s-stand at your service, should you need.~
@9153 = ~N-not that I should know what business they would have with Drow. That is their concern and yours. Not my affair at all.~
@9154 = ~Mmm-hmm.  Very convincing, Vicky.  Next thing you know, she'll be administering to the sick and setting up a program for disenchanted prostitutes.  "Oh, dear," we'll moan, "whatever happened to our wicked little Vicky?"  ... ehhh... or maybe not.~
@9155 = ~Of course, of course. It shall be so.~
@9156 = ~A good attitude. I leave you to your trading.~
@9157 = ~I would be careful in this place, if I were you. Many dangers around many corners. You will be lucky to live.~
@9158 = ~Nevertheless, I insist that I receive the deed before you open the portal.~
@9159 = ~If that is how it must be. Here, take the deed and prepare yourself.~
@9160 = ~What of these others? Who are you <PRO_RACE>? Surely Raelis did not hire you in the hope that you would save her?~
@9161 = ~I have 1,000 Amnish coins left and shall have no more use for them. Would this be sufficient? I shall give them to you once the portal is safe.~
@9162 = ~Mordin dares nothing, I assure you, though it is simply good policy to understand who you are dealing with.~
@9163 = ~I, myself, have seen death here recently. Even the powerful cannot escape it.~
@9164 = ~And he hasn't changed since ye bathed him, woman.  He still whines, cries, throws 'is tantrums and belches after every meal.~
@9165 = ~No real secrets for those that travel here frequently. A trespasser that got his due from someone he crossed.~
@9166 = ~No lies, or even secrets for those that travel here regularly. A trespasser that got his due from someone he crossed.~
@9167 = ~I merely thought you would be interested in recent events. A trespasser that got his due from someone he crossed.~
@9168 = ~And his reward for his effort? Worse than death, even though he seemed willing to share. Imprisoned, magically confined in the cavern north of here. Pity.~
@9169 = ~I should kill you for claiming knowledge of our routines, but I am feeling generous.~
@9170 = ~Ahh, thank you for releasing me. I was sure my destiny was to end imprisoned here forever. I've never been more glad to be wrong.~ [VITHAL02]
@9171 = ~Excuse me there... the fellow in the robes.  Could you hail a carriage for me now?  I would like to be taken home.~
@9172 = ~I am indebted to you. Perhaps we might be of use to each other. I had great plans before I was so rudely interrupted.~
@9173 = ~I suppose that is fair. I have already angered someone in blind pursuit of my goal, and I do not wish it to happen again.~
@9174 = ~Hear me out, and I am sure I will entice you. The prize is wealthy, but the finding is tricky.~
@9175 = ~I am no errand <GIRLBOY>.~
@9176 = ~I can stay here and begin preparatory spells, but I cannot cast the actual dimension-breaching spells without the procedures outlined in my book of rituals.~
@9177 = ~I believe there is a svirfneblin village to the north. They may have taken my gear there. If you go, tell them they may keep everything but the book.~
@9178 = ~Thank you if you can do anything. I will be at the earth elemental portal 'softening' the area with minor spells.~
@9179 = ~It will be worth it in the end, I promise. I would not venture into this place if I did not think it warranted the risk. If you can help, please do.~
@9180 = ~Thank you for you help in this matter. I will see that you get a reward for your efforts.~
@9181 = ~I understand your reasoning, but it is for naught. I have already memorized the necessary spells back at my laboratory. The book you have contains the rituals to complete them, not the entire spells.~
@9182 = ~You see, I anticipated something like this. I have made myself indispensable to the project. I will compensate you fairly, I assure you. ~
@9183 = ~Then we are at an impasse that can only be solved with violence. I am sorry that it came to this yet again. Raise your weapons, I have no choice!~
@9184 = ~I knew it. Now we get to throw ourselves at some creature while you relax.~
@9185 = ~I am not ready to face the guardian yet.~
@9186 = ~I return! Ahh, it's good to have the Prime Material under my feet. There is beauty on the other side, but it is not my home.~ [VITHAL13]
@9187 = ~I thank you. I'm sure that this enchanted rod is sufficient payment.~
@9188 = ~I believe that I took the majority of the risk in this instance. I was the one that traversed the planes, you know.~
@9189 = ~Still, if you are so insistent I suppose that I could up your reward a bit more, though I reserve the right to take the majority for myself.~
@9190 = ~That is sufficient. I thank you for your generosity.~
@9191 = ~And I must refuse your request. I have been more than reasonable, and yet you demand more. What I have given will suffice or we will face each other in battle.~
@9192 = ~It is enough.~
@9193 = ~Any drooling idiot can see why they attack! They want our land. They are mad with lust for it and the evil spirit of the 'Grove' has made them so!~
@9194 = ~Hmph.  I'd rather see you 'go somewhere' with your toady, there.  Uncle Quayle warned me well enough about dirty old men like you.~
@9195 = ~Why does my own mind ask the length of its stay? Do I taunt myself now? Trapped I am, and this is naught but a figment! A dream!~
@9196 = ~You are confused... perhaps mad. Calm yourself or you will come to harm.~
@9197 = ~I'm glad to hear it. The fact of the matter is, Logan's lily-footing ways will fail. I wonder if the fool even wants to stop the mad druids!~
@9198 = ~Thhhh...  uhhhh...~
@9199 = ~Uhhhh...~
@9200 = ~Duhhh...~
@9201 = ~Helloooo, anyone in there?~

@9206 = ~Sh-shut up!  <CHARNAME>, you saved her... n-now make her go away!~
@9207 = ~It... it was. I thank you for you mercy. Here, please take this as payment. It is quite valuable, but I won't be needing it. I'm getting out of here and out of adventuring.~
@9208 = ~I will not give you anything, and I will not be imprisoned again!~
@9209 = ~And what is your place?  To stand at the fore and fling accusations?  I have survived more self-righteous rivvin than you, and done far less harm!~
@9210 = ~I can survive, addled one.  I was taken by surprise today, but I have been among rivvin secretly for quite some time.  But neither do I object to traveling with you.~
@9211 = ~This is not the first problem we've had with these freaks, these tree-huggers. Far from it. Last year, my company was to open a caravan route through the forest.~
@9212 = ~Thhh! The battle has been so long coming! G'lth na dok! I will not be enslaved again!~
@9213 = ~The living death must be erased! I fight for a place at the side of Gith!~
@9214 = ~Come to your deaths quickly, meat-children, I have treacherous drow to deal with.~
@9215 = ~Logan sided with them and forbade my company from entering the Grove on penalty of death. I lost twenty thousand gold pieces!!~
@9216 = ~... AND I WILL NOT YIELD!! YOU CAN NEV... what?~
@9217 = ~... This... this is not right. I was fighting... I was fighting Drow like you but... different Drow. What is going on here?~
@9218 = ~I demand to know your intent! Where is the group I traveled with! Speak!~
@9219 = ~We must decide whether we are the masters of nature or slaves to it. I, for one, do not intend to be a slave. There is only one way to handle a situation such as this.~
@9220 = ~You turn a page in the ancient tome, and a magic portal suddenly opens spawning a bloodthirsty monster!~
@9221 = ~Quickly, <CHARNAME>, these poor inmates might hurt themselves if we don't give them direction.~
@9222 = ~Boo is worried that these inmates will harm themselves, <CHARNAME>. We should see that they are safe and make sure they each have a hamster of their own.~
@9223 = ~That last part was my idea.~
@9224 = ~Oh my, this reminds me of the last Jansen family reunion -being the *last* one for reasons that I'm sure will become clear- back on the eve of the Year of Shadows, when gods walked and magic went wild. Cousin Bungle spiked the turnip tea at the end of a particularly festive jig and half the grandparents got soused enough to storm a nearby ogre camp. You haven't seen chaos until you've been on the receiving end of twenty drunken geriatric goblinstickers, all demanding gems and whatever ale might be on hand, I tell you.~
@9225 = ~A wise tactic to split an opponent's force with magic. Your kind are tricky adversaries, Drow. I will not fall victim to the same again.~
@9226 = ~Enough of this... I must live~
@9227 = ~Coward... you will die!~
@9228 = ~Hmph. I misjudged you, coward. Run along then and play by Logan's lily-livered rules. When I come to power you shall no longer be welcome in Trademeet.~
@9229 = ~I've nothing better to do; we might as well fight.~
@9230 = ~You would attack me for no reason? Even in this place you must be especially reprehensible.~
@9231 = ~You'll pay something or you'll die. It's that simple.~
@9232 = ~Fine, get out of here then.~
@9233 = ~I especially did not expect to meet such friendly people in the form of Drow. Still, actions speak loudest and you have proven to be my friend.~
@9234 = ~There are dangers here for everyone, no matter how long you have stayed.~
@9235 = ~I must try to find my way out and discover what happened to my own group. I wish you well.~
@9236 = ~Good. Take the poison. The druids have a lair in the north east section of the Grove. The font will be there. I shall be at the tavern when you have completed the task. Hurry!~
@9237 = ~The deed is done. The Grove is poisoned and the leader of the druids, Faldorn, is dead.~
@9238 = ~You... you are of the Drow... but not the ones that cast upon me? Have they been driven? Or are you here to complete their task?~
@9239 = ~I don't know who you are, but you've nothing to fear from me.~
@9240 = ~I am here to save you, but your father did not mention what a mewling whelp you were.~
@9241 = ~If you ever make it to our village be sure to speak with my father. His name is Therndle Daglefodd, and he will be most grateful, I know.~
@9242 = ~I'm... I'm going to leave. If... If you let me live then I will tell my father that you rescued me. He may reward you... if you let me go.~
@9243 = ~An obvious threat! There's just no talking to some people!~
@9244 = ~I get the feeling that you wouldn't talk to me even if you could.~
@9245 = ~De'Arnise Signet Ring~
@9246 = ~Who I am is none of your business. Let me pass.~
@9247 = ~I'm sorry, but your meaning escapes me.~
@9248 = ~Halt your threat or there will be blood in the stone tonight. We are peaceful towards the surface and darkness alike.~
@9249 = ~Ahh, travelers to our fair city. That would be rare enough, but you are surfacers by the look of you.~ [GOLDAN02]
@9250 = ~This passage is impassable unless sent by the Lord of this place. Speak to our lead and he may grant access.~
@9251 = ~It is a matter that I would prefer to trust to an outsider. Too much svirfneblin blood has been spilled over this as it is.~
@9252 = ~De'Arnise Signet Ring

This ring was given to Nalia by her father upon her ascension to adulthood.  Bonded to her blood as it is, the ring may not be removed from Nalia, nor its powers used by anyone else.  The ring grants a +2 bonus to all saving throws, +2 armor class bonus, and 50% resistance to fire.

@9258 = ~I will go to seek her out now.  If you are intelligent, you will go to the entrance platform quickly.  The Handmaidens are notoriously impatient.~
@9259 = ~Ha ha!  I like your spirit!  I'd name you Waela, the fool, but I am told your name is Veldrin.  That spirit will serve you well, if you know when to quench it.~
@9260 = ~The Matron Mother has no desire to see her eldest daughter become a snack for the devourers, so we must not fail!  Do you understand, Veldrin?~
@9261 = ~No offense, Malla Drow, but I see you do not wear the symbols of any House that I know. You would fare no better in there, especially with your current companions.~
@9262 = ~It burns the very soul of the Grove!! The Water is dying! All is lost!~ [CEFALD17]

@9269 = ~And also the light gem. With this you will be able to pass the great stairs and enter the lair of Adalon. I wish you well.~
@9270 = ~Iblith! Uh, forgive my outburst, Malla Drow, but I am not used to seeing your people... grace our granitehomes with your presence.~ [GOLDAN09]
@9271 = ~Suffice it to say that I have had dealings with Phaere and House Despana once before.  Due to my own alliances, however, they cannot take proper revenge.  Yet.~
@9272 = ~Leave me be, female.  Your kind has given me more than enough grief to last me a millennium.  Is it not bad enough that I was dragged here against my will?~ [UDSOLA13]
@9273 = ~Oh no, I would not dream of you staying here, good Drow. This place is beneath you, so far beneath.~

@9275 = ~Now, ignore your emasculated commander's outburst, Veldrin, and consider this a time for reward and enjoyment.  Mother Ardulace was pleased by your performance.~
@9276 = ~As you would have it.~
@9277 = ~I do not know why you taunt me, though. You are no surfacers, you are Drow of Ust Natha. He said surfacers rescued him.~

@9283 = ~As it should be.~

@9293 = ~I have watched from afar, and the cruel murder of Therndle's son should earn you my wrath. A pointless death it was!~
@9294 = ~You have come here through trickery, without granting the wishes of Goldander Blackenrock. He and his people will fall to the Baalor they unearthed because of it.~
@9295 = ~You are vile in many ways, but I have need of you. I also know that you have need of me.~

@9303 = ~The two you seek, this Bodhi and Jon Irenicus, I believe they have made a deal with the Drow for their own safe passage and offered a way to tip the scales against their Elven enemy.~
@9304 = ~Ask me no questions, Solaufein.  We shall return to report to the Matron Mothers.  Veldrin... I will see you again in the tavern in three days.~
@9305 = ~You must retrieve them for me. Do this, and I will reveal a safe escape route to leave the Underdark, one that emerges close to where Irenicus plots his next move.~
@9306 = ~I would offer to help you even if there were no reward.~
@9307 = ~You will take the identity of a group of Drow I dispatched recently, a party from another city destined for Ust Natha.~
@9308 = ~When you arrive at the gate, tell them you are from the city of Ched Nasad, and that you seek sanctuary within Ust Natha.~
@9309 = ~Improvise. They are in the turmoil of war at the moment and will overlook much. They will not turn away extra hands.~
@9310 = ~Viconia, is it not? You are a rogue and as much reviled by the Drow as any surface dweller. Still, if you seek redemption and betray me I will end your life.~
@9311 = ~Very well.  The Matron Mothers have decided the deep gnomes, the svirfneblin, have not shown enough fear of the drow as of late.~
@9312 = ~Approach the svirfneblin village in the great caverns and await a patrol.  Slaughter them... and bring back proof of the deed.  Return here in a few days.~
@9313 = ~Take <CHARNAME>, my companions, and kill all others. They are nothing. <CHARNAME> must be taken alive! To it!~
@9314 = ~It is done. You now resemble the denizens of the Drow city, complete with a house insignia that will not draw undue attention. I suggest you act like Drow when speaking to anyone you meet.~ [SILVER07]
@9315 = ~The illusion will last as long as it needs to. Trying to leave the city through their main gate to the surface will dispel the magic. You will be on your own against impossible odds.~
@9316 = ~I will do what I can, Adalon.~
@9317 = ~I thank you. Remember, you are from the city of Ched Nasad. Take a Drow name as well. Use 'Veldrin,' it is commonly used.~
@9318 = ~You are from the city of Ched Nasad! Your Drow name is... is the commonly used 'Veldrin!' Do as I ask!~
@9319 = ~She did not come herself? Another insult to my genius! She turns me, takes my creation, and now she does not dispatch me herself!~
@9320 = ~Ha HA! I removed the crystals that focus the magic for the door! Left it to rot in a pile of refuse! The kobolds have taken it now. They worship it, the fools! No way out for you! You'll starve here! Starve!~

@9322 = ~I am indeed <CHARNAME>. You have heard of me then?~
@9323 = ~May it serve you well in the time ahead. Ahh, but I also promised a safe escape, did I not? One that will lead you nearer Bodhi and Irenicus?~
@9324 = ~His insolence is beyond all endurance.  I cannot tolerate it further without risking my position in Lolth's hierarchy.~
@9325 = ~You can and you will.  You have bloodlust in you, Veldrin, do not deny it.  And what do you owe Solaufein?  Or do you object out of some strange morality?~
@9326 = ~Your reward is continued existence and my continued favor.  You will do this because I command it... or you shall suffer unspeakable torments.~
@9327 = ~Once you are done, take his... hmmm... take his piwafwi cloak and bring it back to me here.  It shall make an excellent trophy.~
@9328 = ~As you place your last item within its statue, the chest in the center of the chamber slams open. There is something within that was not there before.~
@9329 = ~No beginning. No end. I am a symbol of the world's cycles.~

@9331 = ~Here, in this place, you swallow me. Yet, were I more, I could swallow you.~
@9332 = ~To those within the dungeon I am joy. To those fully beneath my gaze, I can be Hell.~
@9333 = ~You must be captured, <CHARNAME>. Someone desires your presence very badly. It is time.~
@9334 = ~Always do I tell the truth, yet cannot speak. Look to me and see what really is.~
@9335 = ~Avatar not formed! Kurtulmak not ready!~
@9336 = ~I do not wish to speak to you again, <MALEFEMALE>, until Solaufein lies dead and rotting and you have returned with his piwafwi cloak.  Go.~

@9340 = ~Scimitar +3: 'Water's Edge'

@9363 = ~Well! You fight well! For now you live! I come tell you when next battle begins.~
@9364 = ~Ahh, you ready now? Getting tough, I know, but you do okay. Time to fight again, so get ready.~
@9365 = ~WHAT?!  Surface creatures?!  Here!!  Hidden amongst us!!  YOU SHALL DIE HORRIBLY FOR THIS IGNOMINY!!  GUARDS!!  KILL THEM ALL!!~
@9366 = ~I have good reason, lord of the nether pits!  I beseech you to aid the drow cause in the war against our hated surface cousins, to carve their pale flesh!~
@9367 = ~And to think we would suffer the same fate as you; you who should have died in our ambush upon the sea.~
@9368 = ~We harbor a special hatred for the illithid, and we will see them dead before we are done. Or we die ourselves.~
@9369 = ~We know much of the tentacled ones. They enslave and they kill, and we will not allow ourselves to remain here.~
@9370 = ~Please do not interrupt our thoughts. We must prepare carefully if we are to see a weakness in the illithid web.~
@9371 = ~They come, and we are drawn to the fight. Weapons ready, my charges, for we are about to be taken into the sight of the most hated illithids.~ [SIMYAZ07]
@9372 = ~Regardless of mistrust or bravado I will speak the plan, and you will have to see the reasonable nature of it.~
@9373 = ~But we of the Githyanki have power of our own, and I believe we may be able to disrupt the illithids and allow another to make an escape.~
@9374 = ~Then you are foolish. We have no choice and will proceed whether you say you will help or not.~
@9375 = ~You do not help our cause by attacking the illithid here! There are many more where they came from! See to the door first!~ [SIMYAZ09]
@9376 = ~But your crime is one that cannot be forgiven. You possess one of our silver swords, and for that you will be put to the test.~
@9377 = ~If you can conquer this place, if you can kill the elder brain, all the doors shall swing wide and you may walk free.~
@9378 = ~That is acceptable. We wait to see if you can muster the strength to free yourself from this place.~
@9379 = ~If not, we will return at a later time with a greater force. This den of filth will be wiped from existence.~
@9380 = ~You live?! The illithids let you go?! Astounding, unless you are in league with them. I warn you, if you serve them you will share their fate.~ [SIMYAZ12]
@9381 = ~No, actually, I DESTROYED THE WHOLE DAMNED BUNCH WITHOUT YOU!!~
@9382 = ~We shall have to test your worth, though your death is the only result we seek. It is a pity that you freed yourself.~
@9383 = ~EEEAAAArrrrrgghghgh!!!~
@9384 = ~I... I live again!... but the... the indignity! I was staked!~
@9385 = ~The golem stares straight ahead. It does not appear to see or hear you. You suspect that the golem is inactive.~
@9386 = ~I see your threat and what you wish, though I have no service to offer in exchange for your deed. I am weak, and this place has sapped my will.~
@9387 = ~No!  Has <CHARNAME> truly fallen so far?!  A glorious rescue has turned into a nightmare of epic proportion!  Minsc and Boo will stop you!~
@9388 = ~You do a terrible thing, here, <CHARNAME>.  I can only pray for your salvation, owing to good deeds you have done in the past... but I shall do this from elsewhere.  Farewell.~
@9389 = ~Sarn! Nind ph' naut Ilythiiri!~
@9390 = ~Nindol orn tlu jivvin. Ssussun pholor dos, shebali!~
@9391 = ~Greetings, lovely female.  I am Szordrin, the manager of the fighting pit... entertainment for us all and a chance to gain Lolth's favor.~
@9392 = ~You tell them, Viconia.~
@9393 = ~Your words ring of lies. You have not the guile to maintain your falsehood! You will fall here!~
@9394 = ~It is a donation to your house, one that will build future alliances beyond these petty dealings.~
@9395 = ~Then we will offer a significant increase over what wage they might earn.~
@9396 = ~Perhaps I should return and report your delay. The Matrons will appreciate your observance of duty while the bodies of our people fall to elves above!~
@9397 = ~You are right, of course. I shouldn't have said such a thing.~
@9398 = ~I offer what I can and I hope it does please. 1,000 gold.~
@9399 = ~You will have what I can afford. 1,000 gold.~
@9400 = ~Then you are a pathetic excuse for a drow, male.  Go and quiver in a corner and pray to the Spider Queen that she gifts you with a proper backbone one day.~
@9401 = ~5,000 gold for your blessings on my journey.~
@9402 = ~A dreaded Nabassu of the lower planes... captured by the Handmaidens for crossing a Matron Mother and sent to fight in the pits.  What say you, <MALEFEMALE>?~
@9403 = ~You have defeated the Nabassu?  Praise to you, <MALEFEMALE>!   We were very entertained by your struggle... here is 500 gp for your display.~
@9404 = ~The shark-fiend is defeated!  The Spider Queen smiles on you this day!  Many weak drow were slaughtered by the beast... it is good to see it put in its place!~
@9405 = ~You... you have killed the eye tyrant?  Truly you are worthy of any lauds Mother Lolth might lay down upon you!  Here... 1,000 gp as a reward for the sight!~
@9406 = ~There are whispers of a great blood-letting planned upon our hated betrayers of the surface world... or perhaps war is to be made on the devourers.~
@9407 = ~Bhaerynden and Telantiwar both are gone now, but Ust Natha remains.  A reminder of the debt of blood we owe to our hated surface brethren.~
@9408 = ~There are many other wards against us, I believe... but the silver beast is the greatest amongst them.~
@9409 = ~If it were no longer guarding the passage, I have little doubt we would overcome the other wards and pay our hated kindred a long-overdue visit.~
@9410 = ~The battle will go on regardless. Watch if you like, but do not obstruct the view of the real audience.~
@9411 = ~If I had, I would be dead. None have prevailed against me and none will. Does anyone here stand to face me? Does anyone dare?~
@9412 = ~Be forewarned that this will be a one on one affair. I will allow no more lopsided slaughters.~
@9413 = ~Very well. Return when you are ready.~
@9414 = ~Bah!  Are you completely devoid of sense?!  Your house-mother should be flayed alive for her neglect of your instruction!~
@9415 = ~The diminutive worms scattered!  I hunted them all -- I have their tiny skulls to this day.  The Running lasted a week before the humans marshaled their defenses.~
@9416 = ~No, I think we will cut our losses this day.~
@9417 = ~I see. Then you will not object to facing me next. Lasaonar is my favorite male and his honor is of value to the First House.~
@9418 = ~I can see that. You will have ample opportunity to test it as well.  Lasaonar is my favorite male and his honor is of value to the First House.~
@9419 = ~Oh, yes.  Vhaeraun, the thief god, and Ghaunadaur, the slime god of the caverns are two of her most implacable foes.  And then, of course, there is Eilistraee...~
@9420 = ~I would rather have a different opponent.~
@9421 = ~Again I would prefer a different opponent.~
@9422 = ~Veldrin, in you go. Attention! A wizard's duel is next in the pit! Mage versus mage!~
@9423 = ~Veldrin now enters the pit to face Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9424 = ~<PLAYER2> faces Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9425 = ~<PLAYER3> faces Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9426 = ~<PLAYER4> faces Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9427 = ~<PLAYER5> faces Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9428 = ~<PLAYER6> faces Chalinthra! Attention all!~
@9429 = ~Yes!  Loyal, we were!  House DeVir!  House DeVir!~
@9430 = ~House DeVir is nothing.  Ashes on the wind.  As you, too, shall be.  You should have died with your own matron, in your own city.  Now... well, we shall see, and I shall find it most amusing.~
@9431 = ~Look upon us refugees of House DeVir, <MALEFEMALE>, and know that this, too, could one day be your fate if Lolth is unkind.~
@9432 = ~Are there any more challenges for me?~
@9433 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! Veldrin is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9434 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! <PLAYER2> is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9435 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! <PLAYER3> is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9436 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! <PLAYER4> is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9437 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! <PLAYER5> is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9438 = ~Then the duel shall commence immediately! Attention all! <PLAYER6> is about to enter a wizard's duel! Eyes to the pit!~
@9439 = ~*Grrrrrowwwwrrr* I... *Grrr* ... work harder!  No hurt!  *Grrrrwwwwrrr*~
@9440 = ~There doesn't seem to be as many guards about as there once was... I've heard that the Matron Mothers are planning to war on the devourers.~
@9441 = ~Where did that child get off to?  I must collect him for the eventide meal, and he's already gone and disappeared.  His mother shall be furious!~
@9442 = ~Do not dare to address me, male!  Look down upon the ground when I pass and praise the Dark Mother of all Drow that you even possess your groveling life!~
@9443 = ~He could not give it! It was not his to begin with! It was stolen from our people and it must be returned.~
@9444 = ~Greetings to you, <CHARNAME>, in the name of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am Squire Catheras, assistant to the Prelate Wessalen.~
@9445 = ~You are returning it? As simply as that? I had not thought this would end without the shedding of blood.~
@9446 = ~Perhaps he did, and perhaps not. Regardless, this is not a matter were we can take chances. Failure to retrieve the sword means death.~
@9447 = ~You there! You are not of our enemy's dark design! Get to the surface and report to Elhan immediately.~
@9448 = ~As you were warned, attempting to take the Rift Device from the dungeon has brought the full force of the curse down upon you. You die with much suffering.~
@9449 = ~Greetings, <GABBER>.  Perhaps if <CHARNAME> is with you, I might speak to <PRO_HIMHER>... <PRO_HESHE> is the spokes<PRO_MANWOMAN> of your group, is <PRO_HESHE> not?~
@9450 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>... I greet you on behalf of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart.  Be welcome here in our Hall.  Do you have business with the Order?~
@9451 = ~The Mind Flayers turn their mind powers against you... you have no hope of survival.~
@9452 = ~Because my enemy is a powerful vampire here in Athkatla, and I offer you the privilege of joining me when I destroy her.~
@9453 = ~I have heard of this vampire.  Her name is Bodhi... but did you not destroy her and her guild at the beckoning of the Shadow Thieves?~
@9454 = ~Hmm.  We know of this vampire, as well as the guild she once led. You destroyed them,  we thought... at the beckoning of the despicable Shadow Thieves!~
@9455 = ~Bah!  We know this vampire.  We know, as well, that you slaughtered the Shadow Thieves at her beckoning.   We cannot trust you!~
@9456 = ~I was not aware of her full nature, and I had little choice.  Now I do and she is my enemy... but she is too powerful for me to defeat alone.~
@9457 = ~When you go to the graveyard to face this creature, I shall send a group led by Sir William Reirrac to fight by your side.  They will meet you in the catacombs.~
@9458 = ~The Order has sought to deal with these creatures, but our chances are greater fighting alongside you.  However, you are not to be trusted.~
@9459 = ~I do not answer to you or anyone else. I've been through hell and I'm in a foul mood.~
@9460 = ~Lying would be amongst the most innocent of things you have done, <CHARNAME>.  Leave this Hall, for you shall receive no aid, here...~
@9461 = ~You will cooperate if you have a brain in your head.  You are in a bad position, having just emerged from the very lair of the enemy.~
@9462 = ~Then lead on. I am in need of allies for the coming battle.~
@9463 = ~I'll have you know I do not trust you. I have no reason to trust you. I do not feel that I *have* to trust you. No doubt the same applies from your perspective.~
@9464 = ~HALF-ORCS:  Half-orcs are born from the union of human and orc parents.  They are as tall as humans, but a little heavier due to their muscular builds.  Their greenish pigmentation, sloping forehead, jutting jaw, prominent teeth and coarse body hair make their lineage plain for all to see.  In the lands of Amn, half-orcs are tolerated, as unlike in the north the people of Amn haven't had centuries of warfare with orc kind.  Half-orcs are known for their great strength, receiving a bonus to their strength and constitution, but a penalty to their intelligence.~
@9465 = ~Elhan will see to you.  He will make sure you are comfortable, and that you reveal what you must of yourself.  He is experienced and... and he has knowledge of the enemy.~
@9466 = ~Come, now, Drizzt... if this be the dire bandit who jumped ye while ye fought the gnolls, then let us dispatch <PRO_HIMHER> and be back to the Ten Towns where we be truly needed.~
@9467 = ~Guard Capt.~
@9468 = ~Very well.  I gave you your chance, whoever you are.  It is obvious that you are the contemptible sort that nothing but death will suffice... so be it.~
@9469 = ~Viconia is an outcast, but proven trustworthy.  I am careful though.  She might kill me if it suited her.~
@9470 = ~Things... things could be worse.  I could have been made into a... a drider.~ [DRSLV103]
@9471 = ~On the dais there is a blood-encrusted altar to some disgusting eight-legged beast. There is the taint of malevolent power in the air.~
@9472 = ~I... I am here to serve.~ [DRSLV104]
@9473 = ~The paladins of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart are here to fight at your side, <CHARNAME>!  Glorious shall our victory be if this great evil can be brought to an end!~
@9474 = ~Understand this as you die, ever pathetic, ever fools!~ [DPJON149]
@9475 = ~Hah! A romantic? Perhaps your death will serve some bard well.~
@9476 = ~It is... it is the Exile!  The Exile has returned!~
@9477 = ~Welcome then! There will soon be a vacancy here in town for I intend to leave at the earliest opportunity.~
@9478 = ~By Umberlee's teat! Who does Galvena think she is? Assassinations in the Vulgar Monkey! That uppity wench!~
@9479 = ~Huh? What do you care? You've only just met him.~
@9480 = ~Select the type of file (Baldur's Gate 1 or 2) to import from.  Note that characters will lose any scroll cases, bags of holding and gem bags that they had.~
@9481 = ~Sanik, the fool, fell in love with one of Galvena's girls, Claire, and she with him. He took her from the guildhouse and proclaimed her his wife.~
@9482 = ~Galvena is a harsh woman. She considers the courtesans her property. She accused Sanik of theft and he scorned her in public. The whole town knows of it.~
@9483 = ~So... so many have died!  So many!~
@9484 = ~The Seldarine watch over us... victory shall be ours this day.~ [ELSOL104]
@9485 = ~There's a theater downstairs, if you like... but don't forget a mug of spiced wine before you go!~ [FFBART03]
@9486 = ~At the Five Flagons, tickling your palate is our pleasure!~ [FFBART04]
@9487 = ~I will not tolerate the presence of outsiders, no matter who they are or what they intend to do for our cause. The risk is too great.~
@9488 = ~You monster, you would deal with someone that makes armor from skin?!~
@9489 = ~I have some associates that wish to speak with you. Well, not so much speak. More like kill.~
@9490 = ~The odd device overwhelms you, causing you to become the Slayer once more... and forcing upon you an urge, a desire... the elder brain is calling you...~
@9491 = ~The most disturbing loss was the ranger Merella. She disappeared after searching for the first person to go missing, some peasant.~
@9492 = ~He decreed no heretic should again enter the city and sealed the doors. He placed his tooth upon the doors so that we could open them. Later, the drow came.~
@9493 = ~With powerful magicks they stormed the city, led by a mage of great strength.  He took Sekolah's Tooth from our lax guardians with the intent of blocking pursuit.~
@9494 = ~The mage built an edifice in the southwest section of the city.  He was killed, but his complex remains.  Sekolah's Tooth is guarded somewhere within...~
@9495 = ~Oooh... this face is boring! Now I'm...~ [PPDILI08]
@9496 = ~Ah... I'm a wolf!~
@9497 = ~I used to have me pretties. Some are hidden... where only I can see. You want to see?~ [PPNALJ07]
@9498 = ~For a reasonable fee, we could retire to my chambers at the Guildhouse. There, we shall explore the depths of our new-found friendship.~
@9499 = ~It is hard to put a value on truly pleasing company such as my own. Let us say 100 gold.~
@9500 = ~It is too dangerous... I could be killed for telling you...~
@9501 = ~Claire was married to Sanik the Trader. He was going to take her away with him on the next ship out but he didn't count on Lady Galvena's nature. She killed him and took Claire from the docks where she waited.~
@9502 = ~She has... cells in the Guildhouse. A cruel dark prison where she places those who displease her. Claire could be there or she could already be dead. Galvena does not allow us to leave.~
@9503 = ~We shall! If anyone should need to wait for you they are free to wait in Lady Galvena's Festhall. Let us go.~
@9504 = ~Thank you for your assistance.~
@9505 = ~He's one of the crueler masters. He's been out of the guild to keep an eye on the new girl, Ginia. Poor girl, she only just 'joined' the guild. Chremy has been very harsh on her.~
@9506 = ~Oh, Miss Galvena be hirin' new masters all the time.  Ye could bluff yer way past the guards if ye had a medallion on ye.~
@9507 = ~Now... ye can either use that to bluff yer way past the guards or I can take ye up to me room, pretendin' yer a customer.  That way, ye starts from within.~
@9508 = ~Take ye up to me room?  Ahhh... I don't want to involve meself anymore than I needs to.  If Miss Galvena finds out, it's me death!~
@9509 = ~Look, miss... I'll take ye up, if ye wish.  But only if ye uses all yer skills to deal with Miss Galvena.  Permanent-like.  Ye'll be doin' a lot of people a favor.~
@9510 = ~Claire?  Is that what this be all about?  Hmph.  Well, I don't know how ye plan to pass the guards, but I've no objection to ye trying to help the poor lass.~
@9511 = ~I lurk behind your soul, in the very fiber of your being. I am the only thing left when mind and reason are stripped away.~ [Dream303]
@9512 = ~Bloody pirates... we used t' have a peaceful town, here, e'en in the middle of the Nelathir.  Pirates used t' fear Spellhold, you know... until they figured out the mages there don't give a rat's arse about us.~
@9513 = ~You might... ah... 'convince' him to give it up. He might take a bribe, but likely your meeting with him will have to be violent.~
@9514 = ~A little too much saltwater can taint the mind, and it's not uncommon for someone to lose their grip. Desharik is the one that can order them confined.~
@9515 = ~I can get ye into me room, but once ye leaves, ye'll be dealin' with the guards.  If ye want to move about secret-like, I can help ye with that, as well.~
@9516 = ~Perhaps you lose yourself in the end, but you will go to greater reward than you can know.~ [Dream412]
@9517 = ~Island Concerns: Ginia's Tale

I told Ginia that I killed Chremy, but I also said that I will not pay the smuggler Calahan to take her and her brother off the isle.~
@9518 = ~I must be abrupt for there are things that I must attend to. I have heard much of Lady Galvena's evil and I intend to put a stop to it. Will you help in exchange for your freedom?~
@9519 = ~Corruption magics, illusions from a race of spirits, the Rakshasa. Such creatures are very predatory. It would appear that there is no depth to which Irenicus will not sink.~ [ELHAN114]
@9520 = ~Suldanessellar is under siege. With this number of beasts under his command, Irenicus will be very hard to unseat.~ [ELHAN115]
@9521 = ~We must proceed with caution. Not everyone in the city can withstand an onslaught like this. Their safety must take priority.~
@9522 = ~I am here to find a girl called Claire. I am under the impression that Galvena holds her captive somewhere within. I need your help to free her.~
@9523 = ~This mace has been crafted finely by the drow, and specially treated to survive the glare of the sun.  It is made for surface raids by the subterranean race... and its black metal glistens with a dark poison that seems to be generated from within and causes incredible damage upon a successful impact.
The mace seems almost alive and warm to the touch, and slithers away from those whom it does not like... namely drow or those who are similar enough to not make a difference.  In the hands of anyone else, the mace becomes mere dead weight.

@9527 = ~Cannot equip ranged weapon when an off-handed weapon is equipped.~
@9528 = ~Cannot equip launcher when an off-handed weapon is equipped.~
@9529 = ~These berries are a potential clue to solving the murders in the Bridge District. Take them to Rose Bouquet to see if she recognizes the smell.~
@9530 = ~You were warned! Attack not those that would be your friends, forced though the friendship is!~
@9531 = ~They broke into the temple and killed all the acolytes!  It... it was horrifying!  I barely escaped, and I... I'm not sure if anyone else...~
@9532 = ~... she pushed me behind her, to protect me, and I fell.  And... and then she distracted the creature and ran away.  It... it chased her... and when it caught her... it... I...~
@9533 = ~Give me the draught. There! We shall pour three mugs, one for each of the two guards at the doors. When they are asleep, the girl will enter Galvena's chamber where Rerdes stands guard.~
@9534 = ~<CHARNAME>! There is no time for this! Dispel whatever madness has come over you and return to the only course available to us!~
@9535 = ~Don't you think that you're overreacting?~
@9536 = ~** THE SPIRITS OF THIS WOOD WILL BE CALLED TO DEFEAT THE EVIL THAT THE EXILE HAS BROUGHT INTO OUR MIDST. **~
@9537 = ~Are things going well? I have secured several of my people from immediate danger, but if Irenicus is not stopped, our efforts are meaningless.~ [ELHAN117]
@9538 = ~Did she? It is high time that my loyal service was recognized. Very well, let's have it.~
@9539 = ~Uh... clients, captain. I'll take them out of the room with haste. Please, drink up.~
@9540 = ~Alright, I suppose that you'll need the tankard back.~
@9541 = ~... erghhh...~
@9542 = ~Arrogance is a common trait among the dregs of adventuring.~
@9543 = ~I will do anything that I can but I must see my husband Sanik first.~
@9544 = ~Killed? ... no... (sob)...~
@9545 = ~... No... why did she have to? (sob)~
@9546 = ~Certainly! Please take this gold. It is all that I have but I offer it with pleasure.~
@9547 = ~What... who... WHO DARES?!~ [IRENIC59]
@9548 = ~You... you live *yet*?!  You have less than a fraction of your soul and yet somehow you *continue* to oppose me?~ [IRENIC60]
@9549 = ~You had to know I wouldn't let you get away.~
@9550 = ~I am Ellesime, Queen of Suldanessellar. I am at the center of the tree with Joneleth, within his cage of corruptive magicks. I can send my image no further.~
@9551 = ~Whether you are here to save my people or just kill he who tormented you, I care not. One thing must be done... the parasites on the Tree of Life must die!~
@9552 = ~Do that and I can sever Jon's connection to the Tree... Only then can he be killed! I... believe he has protected the parasites somehow... I do not know. Hurry!~
@9553 = ~Do not call me that!  I lost all right to that name when the Seldarine stripped me of everything that was elven, as you well know.~ [IRENIC64]
@9554 = ~It... is all I have now, Ellesime.  There is nothing else beyond my revenge.  Revenge for what you did to me, that the Seldarine did to me...~ [IRENIC65]
@9555 = ~I do not remember your love, Ellesime.  I have tried.  I have tried to recreate it, to spark it anew in my memory.  But it is gone... a hollow, dead thing.~ [IRENIC67]
@9556 = ~For years, I clung to the memory of it.  Then the memory of the memory.  And then nothing.  The Seldarine took that from me, too!~ [IRENIC68]
@9557 = ~I could have loved you anew, as I loved the man you once were.  But I see nothing of him here.  You are Irenicus.  And all that awaits you now... is death.~ [ELLESI14]
@9558 = ~Ahhh... so you have come to us at last, Child of Bhaal.  You have come to claim your heritage, perhaps?  And in pieces, no less.  Tsk tsk tsk... how terrible it must be to die in such a state.~ [HELFEA06]
@9559 = ~If this is victory, there is a question burning in the back of your mind: What about what he stole from you. What of your soul?~
@9560 = ~Your heritage, Child. This is Bhaal's realm. You have not faded to join the former Lord of Murder's essence, have you? No... so your blood holds sway here.~
@9561 = ~I bow before you, of course. You are a Child of Murder, but your essence has not rejoined that of the dead Bhaal. In your Father's realm... your blood holds sway.~
@9562 = ~A beast with no visible support within its gelatinous body. The acid touch of these creatures can vary from type to type, but all are deadly scavengers.~
@9563 = ~'Faerie-folk' include many kinds of small, generally benevolent creatures. The image most associated with the term is that of a small, winged, mischievous creature, though their dispositions can vary as much as any other race.~
@9564 = ~Also called Illithid, the brain devouring Mind Flayers are hideously alien creatures of the Underdark. Evil beyond redemption, they will consider you a slave or simply food, if they consider you at all.~
@9565 = ~... such as this cloak, for instance.  Stitched together from the flayed skins of lovely nymphs.  Wear it and be soothed by its powerful magic... panic will never overcome you again.~ [HELFEA13]

@9567 = ~Shadows are malevolent, undead creatures that drain strength from their victims with their chilling touch. Those so afflicted can look forward to becoming a Shadow themselves if contact continues.~
@9568 = ~Imps are diminutive creatures of an evil nature that roam the world and occasionally act as familiars for evil wizards and priests. Only magical or silver weapons harm them, and they also regenerate.~
@9569 = ~Dragons are an ancient, winged reptilian race. They are known and feared for their size, physical prowess, and magical abilities. The oldest dragons are among the most powerful creatures in the world. Chromatic dragons are generally evil in nature, while Metallic dragons tend towards good.~
@9570 = ~The Lich is potentially the most powerful form of undead known to exist, and they are difficult, if not impossible, to destroy. Besides having the power of an undead wizard at their command, some even store their life-force in a secure location separate from their physical form. Destruction of their body is meaningless unless the container is found as well.~
@9571 = ~You add the tainted tadpoles... which destroy the Kuo-toan tadpoles in the pool.~
@9572 = ~Back, Drow! Back to the depths you call home! I will not have creatures such as you amidst the trees of Suldanessellar!~
@9573 = ~We shall drive you back, dark ones! There will be no tolerance of your Underdark ways!~

@9576 = ~You hold power here... or rather the pieccce of Bhaal within you holdsss power here. And that part ressstss now in both you and the other one, the wizard, yesss?~
@9577 = ~He ssstole much of your sssoul, but not all, sso you are tethered to him, asss he isss to you.  Neither of you iss dead, and neither iss alive.  Interesssting.~
@9578 = ~Ah.  Ssssso the Child of Bhaal comesss to me, finally, for the lassst of the Tearsssss of Bhaal.  You have come very nearss to locating your quarry... yesssss, indeedss you have.~ [HELGRE07]
@9579 = ~Ahhh... so you have come to us at last, Child of Bhaal.  You have come to claim your heritage, perhaps?  And in pieces, no less.  Tsk tsk tsk... how terrible it must be to die in such a state.~ [HELPRI06]
@9580 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Met with militia.

The Trademeet Militia Captain was relieved that I wished to help stop the attacks the town has suffered. She directed me to High Merchant Lord Logan Coprith. She warned that the scared townsfolk are suspicious of outsiders, especially Druids.~
@9581 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Unnecessary violence.

I have fought the Militia Captain in Trademeet. I don't know the nature of the animal attacks they have been suffering, or if their suspicions against druids are justified, but this battle will certainly not help the situation.~
@9582 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Not interested.

The Militia Captain in Trademeet says that the town is under sustained attack by animals.  Local Druids are suspected. I said I was not interested in helping at this time. She suggested I leave.~
@9583 = ~Ahhh... so you have come to us at last, Child of Bhaal.  You have come to claim your heritage, perhaps?  And in pieces, no less.  Tsk tsk tsk... how terrible it must be to die in such a state.~ [HELSEL06]
@9584 = ~Your heritage, Child. This is Bhaal's realm. You have not faded to join the former Lord of Murder's essence, have you?  No... so your blood holds sway, here.~
@9585 = ~Ah.  So the Child of Bhaal comes to me, finally, for the last of the Tears of Bhaal.  You have come very near to locating your quarry.  Oh yes, indeed you have.~ [HELSEL07]
@9586 = ~But all thingss, even the most powerful, can be overcome, yess?  You have defeated many whossse claims of power were ssso hollow.  You tore them down from their thronesss...~ [HELGRE08]

@9595 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Apprised Cernd.

I have told Cernd what I know of the situation with Faldorn and the druids. He has said that only a challenge from another druid can unseat her, and I have suggested that Jaheira give it a try.~
@9596 = ~Flee this place, lest you fall as a casualty of circumstance! Get to the surface and report to Elhan, he will see to your safety.~
@9597 = ~What... wha-what is this place?!  I died, I'm sure of it, and I felt... I felt a dragging, a pulling, to this place.  It was you, wasn't it?  You brought me here in your... in your wake.~ [VALYGA83]
@9598 = ~I died, indeed.  I... would not be here, normally, except I knew this was not finished, this battle.  I felt your tugging and I came willingly... Mazzy Fentan has never backed away from a battle.~ [MAZZY90]
@9599 = ~Eh?  Oh, the Nine Hells, is it?  Hmph.  Yes, I felt your infernal power tugging at me, but I was coming here anyway.  There might be profit, yet, by remaining at your side... we'll see.~ [EDWIN90]
@9600 = ~This is most... unusual.  Death overwhelmed me in combat, and the darkness came over my senses.  I felt a pulling, and followed it and... and here we are.  What place is this, I wonder?~ [VICONIB7]
@9601 = ~So...  your quest does not end, even with your death.  And somehow your descent into this plane has drawn me here as if into a whirlpool.  So be it... I shall help you as best I can.~ [CERND77]

@9609 = ~I yield. You have proven the better combatant this day. I... I yield the victory.~
@9610 = ~Thank you for visiting Lady Galvena's Festhall.~
@9611 = ~I assume he was talking about *this* chest, though.  And that means I can't let you open it... or do anything to it... even if I'm not guarding what's inside.~

@9616 = ~As horrific as this place is, it merely mirrors the soul we now share. Shrink from it if you will, but I have grown to appreciate what it can offer!~
@9617 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Balance is restored.

Faldorn has been defeated. She was killed in a druid battle and the grove is now free of her influence. Verthan has been appointed challengemaster until such time as the grove recovers from the Shadow Druid taint. Trademeet will suffer no more attacks.~
@9618 = ~He left because he was afraid, afraid of settling down and leaving his blessed nature.  Galia went along with their break-up so she wouldn't 'hold him back.'~
@9619 = ~Fine man to look at, but cold in the eyes. Treated her bad... didn't get any better when she gave birth. Got worse, to tell th' truth.~
@9620 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: Told Cernd of outcome.

I told the druid Cernd about how I solved the problems in the druid grove. He was grateful, but I don't know if I wished him in my group. He has gone to the grove, where he has said I may find him if need be.~
@9621 = ~Spell trigger is much like spell sequencer in that it allows the caster to store several spells in a trigger item that can be released upon any target, including the caster. The spells stored in the sequencer are cast as any other spell and can be accessed through the special abilities button on the main screen.  It is important to note that when you choose the spells to be stored in the trigger, they will disappear from the ones you have memorized.  However, the trigger will last until used so the caster may rest and gain those spells back.  The main use for this spell would be to allow the caster to release multiple spells upon a target very quickly in combat without the possibility of being interrupted.~
@9622 = ~Katana +2
To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

@9624 = ~Intrigue with Jarlaxle

Lies again, of course. The gems Jarlaxle wished stolen did not contain the souls of his men, whom he never risked by attacking the Lich to begin with. The gems were actually valuable artifacts belonging to House Jae'llat, of which the Lich was an ally. Jarlaxle concocted this whole affair for his original goal of retribution against the House that failed to pay him. I may have gained the means to enter two Drow dwellings, but this chicanery makes my head spin. The Rope will get me back to where I should be.~
@9625 = ~You may choose <number> spells to put in your spell book.  These will be the spells that your character currently has the ability to cast.~
@9626 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: A helpful druid.

I met with a Druid patrolling around the grove. He let slip that a Shadow Druid named Faldorn was controlling the area with an iron fist. He seemed reluctant to harm me, though he also suggested that others would not be as hesitant.~
@9627 = ~Some of the others have all but joined her as Shadow Druids as well. She is not the only enemy now. I must go. I cannot be seen with outsiders.~
@9628 = ~She has seduced quite a few with her Shadow Druid wiles. Perhaps he could challenge her... she seems subject to the old ways even as she poisons our intentions.~
@9629 = ~Animal Trouble in Trademeet: The Shadow Druid.

I have met with Faldorn, the Shadow Druid in control of the grove. She has bonded with the land, and the only way to unseat her from power is for another druid to challenge her in one on one combat.~
@9630 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

I have been told that one of Kretor's pickpockets has been stealing from the guild. None of the four possible culprits claim to know who has done it. I have decided to kill them all. I will not have dishonest thieves under me. Kretor can replace them.~
@9631 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

I have been told that one of Kretor's pickpockets has been stealing from the guild. None of the four possible culprits claim to know who has done it. I have decided to kill one of them. With luck I'll get the right one. If not, I'm sure the fear will straighten the others out.~
@9632 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: Thieves among thieves.

It would seem that I chose the right thief to kill. Kretor reports that the stealing of guild funds has stopped. A lucky choice indeed.~
@9633 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: the guild has failed.

My thieves will no longer work with me unless I have the support of the main Shadow Thief guild. They suggested that I ask Renal Bloodscalp to reinstate me.~
@9634 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: business as usual.

I must remember to check in at my thieves' guild every 5 days or so. I must continue to check on my thieves and also pay the quotamaster.~
@9635 = ~Thieves' Guild Stronghold: The price of failure.

It appears that Renal will allow me to continue as master of my own guild branch, but it will cost me to do so.~
@9636 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: First test.

I have been given my first test as a member of the Most Noble Order. I am to go to the furthest reaches of the Umar Hills where I will find a besieged group of knights. I am to do what I must to save them. I have very little time and must leave immediately.~
@9637 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties:

I have failed in my service as a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. My actions or lack thereof have caused serious damage, unbefitting a paladin. I have been removed from the Order, the honor that was granted has been stripped.~
@9638 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A good person has fallen.

I saved two of those I was sent to rescue, but the odds were against the third. The Order will survive, but that is small consolation to those that knew the victim. It is unfortunate, and very bad for morale.~
@9639 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A Baron's request.

Baron Metrich wishes a number of squatters removed, and has cited recent violence against his men as just cause for such action. I must go to the neutral meeting place, a tavern in the Umar Hills, in the village of Imnesvale. I must restore order and bring favor on our name.~
@9640 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A fitting end.

The Order will stand by my actions with the Baron I was sent to appease. His claims were lies, such that I could not allow him to continue.~
@9641 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A child in distress.

The Morningale family has been slaughtered for their part in combating slavery. I am to go to a safehouse where Tyrianna has been secreted away. I am to guard her until her godparent arrives to take her to Baldur's Gate. Hurgis Baltezan will be there as soon as he can.~
@9642 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: A moral victory.

Tyrianna is alive and well, thanks to me being able to detect the evil that was about to be perpetrated. The real Hurgis collected her as he said he would, confirming my suspicion that a fake Hurgis had been sent in his place to begin with. I have now been given leave to pursue my own goals. The Order will contact me if further service is required.~
@9643 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: doesn't look like squatters.

I have spoken with Brunson, one of the supposed squatters that I am to oust. He suggested that I go out of my way to speak with some of the others involved in this situation.~
@9644 = ~Paladin Stronghold Duties: Baron not what he seems?

The Baron is well pleased with the bloody measures I have taken. I am not so sure, however, that the Baron has accurately represented himself. Just now his aide called the 'squatters' simple farmers. Still, we have the Baron's favor now.~
@9645 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should ignore his wife's infidelity. His marriage will continue despite this simple indiscretion.~
@9646 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should kill his wife for her infidelity. Her crime is unforgivable.~
@9647 = ~Cleric Stronghold: how to heal a cuckold?

I have advised Glinden that he should remind his wife of her duty to their vows. She will understand that duty is all-important.~
@9648 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was well served. 

Stressing self-sacrifice for the love of another was in the true spirit of the teachings of Lathander, and Glinden and his wife have benefited. I have served the church well.~
@9649 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander was not served. 

I have not done well in the eyes of Lathander. I should have stressed that Glinden adopt a more self-sacrificing love for his wife. Instead, they are unhappy and church doctrine is unsatisfied.~
@9650 = ~Cleric Stronghold: My church has rejected me. 

My actions were so contrary to church teachings that I have been cast out. I no longer have the sanctuary I was granted.~
@9651 = ~The prophecy of Sekolah

Taken down into a city far below the ocean surface by the Sahuagin, I was greeted by a High Priestess of the shark god Sekolah and told that I was intended for some higher purpose that Sekolah had foretold.  Not one to be used, I refused their 'hospitality'... I would rather fight my way back to the surface, if need be.~
@9652 = ~Cleric Stronghold: a troubled killer.

Ti'Vael came to me seeking wisdom. He had killed a man in what looked like a duel, but he claims he actually murdered the man because of the insults he hurled. I told him to turn himself in.~
@9653 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is well pleased.

While prison may not be the happiest of places, Ti'Vael's spirit will flourish in the end. He had a duty to a greater law, and I advised him properly.~
@9654 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is mostly satisfied.

Events with Ti'Vael could have been handled better. Remember the greater duty, and do not surrender to sentiment.~
@9655 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A faithless heretic. 

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I killed her for it.~
@9656 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A crisis of faith. 

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I stressed the duty that she should have to the church. She seemed unresponsive.~
@9657 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A crisis of faith.

Rania came to me to confess a lack of faith. I expelled her from the church. There is no place here for unbelievers.~
@9658 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander prefers empathy.

The Morninglord is appreciative of the importance of duty, but a more compassionate front would have served poor Rania better.~
@9659 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander is pleased.

The compassionate way that I advised Rania has garnered me some respect among my peers. The Morninglord is well pleased.~
@9660 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Lathander is disappointed. 

I was far too harsh on poor Rania. The Morninglord would have me act more compassionate to those in distress.~
@9661 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is pleased.

Rania is a regrettable loss, but if her faith could not stand up to the pressures of duty, her loss was necessary.~
@9662 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Helm is not pleased.

I was too lenient on Rania and her weakened faith. Duty should have been better stressed. If she could not stand up to such, she is not worthy of Helm.~
@9663 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Talos was well served.

My actions with Rania have been praised, though death would have been a better reward for her questioning.~
@9664 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A challenge.

Cotirso's fate was his own, and the church has accepted that he took his life into his hands when he challenged me.~
@9665 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is pacified.

Lathander viewed my lack of offense against Cotirso as a good example of restraint, though I should not have goaded him by threatening to take the matter up with our superiors. A calm front would accomplish more.~
@9666 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is pacified.

Helm would rather have had me accept Cotirso's challenge, although everything has worked out regardless.~
@9667 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Cotirso is removed.

Helm is satisfied that Cotirso took his life into his hands when he challenged me. I had no choice but to accept and respond as I must.~
@9668 = ~Cleric Stronghold: Halting the Talon War.

I have served the greater law and pacified both the Talons and the followers of the Morninglord. My service to Helm has been recognized as invaluable. For now I have been released from further service as a boon for all that I have done so far. I await to be called if need be.~
@9669 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A strong offense. 

I have been directed to bring the fury of the Morninglord to bear upon the house of Talos. They were to attack the Dawnbringer's home, and we cannot allow it.  I am to enter the den of the enemy and wreak horrible justice. This is my holy crusade.~
@9670 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll.  

My vengeance has been brought down upon the house of Talos. They have been wiped out for now, and the house of the Morninglord will see the dawn in peace. I have been given time to... recover from my efforts, though I eagerly await a future call to service.~
@9671 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll avoided.  

I have succeeded in appeasing the Lathander faithful, such that they will not march on their enemy this night. Further bloodshed has been avoided.~
@9672 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A terrible toll to come.  

I have failed to appease the followers of Lathander. They march against Talos in anger tonight. While they may succeed this day, I can only see escalation on the horizon.~
@9673 = ~Cleric Stronghold: A glorious battle to come!

I have been given the blessing of Talos, and the sacred duty to deliver his wrath! The Lathander temple will be cleansed tonight! My wrath shall be terrible and beautiful!~
@9674 = ~Mage Stronghold: The Solamnic Knights.

I asked the Cowled Wizard Teos what he would do about the Solamnic Knights brought here in the sphere from their own home plane. He suggested that I kill them. On the useful side, he did mention that Ribald at the Adventurers' Mart might have insight into unique situations such as this. Alternately, I could petition the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. They know how to deal with paladins and such.~
@9675 = ~Mage Stronghold: I have apprentices.

Teos has brought me three young mages that I am to guide through study. Teos was not too thrilled, but I will make good use of the situation, I am sure.~
@9676 = ~Mage Stronghold: Teos unmoved.

Teos did not seem too concerned that my apprentices have all met unfortunate deaths in my service. Business as usual, I guess, though I will miss the chance to shape some young minds in my image.~
@9677 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ambush!

Teos had not summoned me to the sphere. It was an ambush to get us both. We were attacked by a strange assailant. He screamed about the 'glory of Argrim.'~
@9678 = ~Mage Stronghold: Fanatic assassination.

Teos has given me a new task. I am to dispatch one Lord Ketlaar Argrim. He is an anti-magic fanatic, and wants us all confined or killed. I am to use a special rune of imprisonment on him so that he will not be a martyr. He will simply disappear.  Ketlaar can be found at the Crooked Crane near the city gates.~
@9679 = ~Mage Stronghold: Free at last.

I have been released from service to the Cowled Wizards. I did as they asked to the best of my ability, facing off against Lord Ketlar and whatnot, so now I have unfettered use of the Planar Sphere. A painfully obvious base of operations, but it will have to do.~
@9680 = ~Mage Stronghold: Apprentice crap.

Apparently those apprentices that were dumped on me were supposed to take instruction and make what I directed. I have no time to care, so I just cut them loose. Let's see what they can do on their own. Might be a bit dangerous, but they have to learn sometime, right?~
@9681 = ~Mage Stronghold: Young minds to mold.

The apprentices have given me a unique opportunity. I am to give them instruction, guiding their learning, and they will attempt to make me magical items. Each week they will display their results as they work on their talents. Already it sounds as though the range of items is quite broad. I look forward to seeing what they can do.~
@9682 = ~Mage Stronghold: A messenger from Teos?

A messenger approached me to say that I should return to the Planar Sphere at once. Teos apparently awaits there with urgent news.~
@9683 = ~Mage Stronghold: Graduation was great.

It was a great opportunity to see my apprentices graduating from their studies. They seemed genuinely appreciative, and I thanked them for their kind words. I hope they fare well, despite the Cowled Wizards lording over them.  I look forward to seeing what they can do...~
@9684 = ~Mage Stronghold: Graduation was somber.

I tried to keep a smile during the ceremony. It is good to see the young making their own way in the world. It's just a pity that they couldn't all have lived to see this day. Not that life under the yoke of the Cowled Wizards would have been all that great, but it would have been interesting. Oh well. I guess you can only wish well who you can, and say a word in memorandum for the rest.~
@9685 = ~Mage Stronghold: Attacking the fanatic.

I have encountered Lord Ketlaar. There really is no talking to him. He is blind to everything, save hatred of magic.~
@9686 = ~Mage Stronghold: Ribald can free the Knights.

Ribald in the adventurers' mart has the means to send the knights home, but he requires 9,000 gold.~
@9687 = ~Mage Stronghold: I have paid for the Knights.

Ribald has taken 9,000 gold and has promised to send a mage to the sphere and teleport the knights home. At these prices, she had better show up!~
@9688 = ~Mage Stronghold: The Knights at the Order.

I have spoken with the Prelate of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart. He has said that the Solamnic Knights can stay as with them as honored guests. It's a viable alternative if they can't get home another way.~
@9689 = ~Mage Stronghold: A request for help.

The Solamnic Knights that were trapped in the Sphere and brought to this plane have asked that I try and find a way for them to get home. I will look into it.~
@9690 = ~Drizzt, I'm so glad you could come.~
@9691 = ~Cannot equip a ranged weapon in your off hand.~
@9692 = ~I have seen the like of this place before all too closely. It is where they house those that are different, where the misunderstood are forgotten...~
@9693 = ~Pretties, you say? Do you mean... gems? Have you any faculties left? Can you remember?~
@9694 = ~This young minstrel has lost his wits and his songs? Minds are common enough, but tunes of merit are few and far between.~
@9695 = ~Hmph.  I would respond to yer comment with me axe if the mere thought of movin' didn't make me stomach roll.  Begone, and count yerself lucky this time!~
@9696 = ~Rest, child. None of this group shall harm you.~
@9697 = ~Okay, I'm not quite so concerned about this little freak. Rule as you will, little tyrant, just as long as it is from a cell.~
@9698 = ~Yes! Such fire and conviction! A pity there are no actual enemies to warrant the screaming, but good show anyway. Boo applauds!~
@9699 = ~CHAPTER FOUR

Bodhi was as good as her word and you are quickly under sail, the flamboyant Saemon Havarian at the helm. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliff side.~ [CHAPT04B]
@9700 = ~Would that I had a healing touch that could help this man. I think his madness is of his own making though.~
@9701 = ~I do believe that he probably looked too far into the business of the gods. It was not his place to do so.~
@9702 = ~I see... a walking corpse... he speaks... to a pillar of skulls? See, it is madness!~
@9703 = ~You're just not all there, are you.~
@9704 = ~All bluster and balderdash, ain't ya. Uncle Chester Bellowsbreath was like that too, talking himself so big that you'd swear he was ten feet tall, which was not too far off considering he had a strange disorder stemming from an obscenity hurled at a passing wizard one drunken eve in Waterdeep. Stomp and pomp all ye wish, but it would do you well to take the simple advice of never telling Khelben Blackstaff to "put a shine on that thing and stop being so darned pompous with yer dark-cornered mysteriosity," and if you do, don't punctuate it with a rotten turnip at high velocity.~
@9705 = ~Ah...~
@9706 = ~Tiax has lost his place! The indignity!~
@9707 = ~Okay, that does it. I'm all for just leaving the halfling here when we go. Who's with me on that?~
@9708 = ~Hmph.  That's putting it mildly.  (Godhood should be solely reserved for those with the proper destiny and mental endurance.  Me, for instance!)~
@9709 = ~Hrmph!~
@9710 = ~The imp has failed to string out his usual longwinded story. Praise be, the end must be comin'.~
@9711 = ~His ramblings have no meaning. He is raging at enemies long since gone.~
@9712 = ~Oh, sure, we're his best friends now that we're going to go and steal him a brand new ship and everything.  And once we gotten it for him, you think he'll still be so nice?  Reminds me of my cousin Beauregarde.  The most selfish gnome you've ever seen, he wouldn't give you a spare turnip for anything.  Well, okay there was that one time he gave a turnip to Uncle Scratchy, but Uncle Scratchy had him held over a vat of boiling ---~
@9713 = ~Aha! Something from my mother's mother's father! A real whiz around pots and pans. Wait, I said that wrong.~
@9714 = ~Well, fine.  I just wanted to point out that Beauregarde was eaten by a griffon that was terrorizing the hillside and he gave the beast fatal indigestion.  So sometimes even the most selfish of us can still give.~
@9715 = ~What now? Move along, I've rather strained my voice.~ [PPDRAD11]
@9716 = ~It is a weakness on her part. A superior mind could handle such a gift.~
@9717 = ~(Sigh. It's aggravation like this that will eventually cause me to fireball the entire party as they sleep. Yes indeed, everyone peaceful and quiet and then FOOM!)~
@9718 = ~Negative Plane Protection 
(Abjuration)
Sphere: Protection, Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration:  5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell affords the caster or touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The negative plane protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, possibly offsetting the effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a negative energy attack is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell.  The protected creature suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience.  This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane.~
@9719 = ~Lesser Restoration (Necromancy) 
Level: 4
Sphere:  Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Target Creature
Saving Throw: None 

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised.  This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster.  The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest and she will likely require rest immediately after the casting, as it will cause days' worth of fatigue almost instantaneously.~
@9720 = ~This... this is the Underdark.  Oh, I do not want to be here, I don't!  This place is death for my people!  I... I feel as if I'm going to suffocate here!~ [AERIEB7]
@9721 = ~A HA! I shall treasure this moment. The proud Drow, humbled by a keen-eyed duergar.~
@9722 = ~Don't be worried, Aerie.  I'm here to protect my witch.  Boo, too, though I think he would leap to protect anyone in distress.  It's his heroic nature, you know.~
@9723 = ~Hmm... I didn't like his tone. I know a few insults in the Under tongue, and that weren't flattery.~
@9724 = ~Could I be healed instead?~
@9725 = ~So I am in my homeland once again.  Already I feel how unwelcome it has become.  My eyes are no longer used to its darkness and my senses to the hint of the threat around every corner.~ [VICONIB5]
@9726 = ~A most underhanded maneuver, <CHARNAME>.  Although I am sure it is no less than Phaere might have planned for us.  There is an ironic justice in this, no?~
@9727 = ~So... a war?  Open battle between the Drow and the surface has not occurred in... eons.  With a greater demon to back them... I truly wonder why Irenicus would do this.~
@9728 = ~Ha! I don't know his words all that well, but I do respect those willing to risk insulting strangers.~
@9729 = ~Do you see, <CHARNAME>? See the fear in his eyes? You now enjoy the respect the Drow have earned.~
@9730 = ~Do not question the words of a Drow, worm! It is not your place to do so! Despite how... sickeningly merciful they may be.~
@9731 = ~Should we be so quick to do what she says?  Solaufein hasn't done anything to deserve death.  Let's just step lightly before we commit to anything, okay?~
@9732 = ~Careful, Aerie, we must maintain the illusion that we are who we seem.~
@9733 = ~As a drow on the surface, he should expect such treatment.  If I tracked down every rivvil who has wronged me, I would end up doing little else.~
@9734 = ~Fool mages, always sticking their noses in where they don't belong.~
@9735 = ~Thanks a lot, Valygar. Shall I call all rangers pigheaded because of you?~
@9736 = ~This Drow is well respected by the Harpers, <CHARNAME>.  I will not assist you fighting him.  I will return to Athkatla; consider your idiocy before we speak again.~
@9737 = ~When Evil was torn asunder, three pieces were locked away. For a millenium I have guarded this piece, dispensing death to those that follow Darkness.~
@9738 = ~I am in the Bridge District of Athkatla. What kind of tricks are you playing on me?~
@9739 = ~Yet, you had a key, a Rogue Stone. What did you hope to accomplish by trespassing in my chamber?~
@9740 = ~Athkatla? Hardly. The portal is known only to my creatures and yet you had a key, a Rogue Stone. What did you hope to accomplish by trespassing in my chamber?~
@9741 = ~The odds do not favor that statement, Nalia.~
@9742 = ~I hope you are right, Nalia. We must take care to not upset the natural balance of this region.~
@9743 = ~And an army on your heels, no doubt.~
@9744 = ~You needn't worry. The Underdark will change you long before you have any effect on it.~
@9745 = ~We won't need your luck. I am sure that the denizens of this place will pose no threat.~
@9746 = ~Not by a long shot, fool! You'll speak with respect when you address me or you'll be sleeping six feet lower than usual. Understand?!~
@9747 = ~I realize we must act in keeping with our Drow appearance, but I begin to think you enjoy it.~
@9748 = ~You fit the role of Drow a bit too easy, Korgan.~
@9749 = ~More and more I enjoy the fear we wield down here.~
@9750 = ~I came to Hell to help my friend!  Who helps you, Irenicus?  Demons?  You are going to die alone in Hell and you know it!~ [AERIEB8]
@9751 = ~Oh dear. I take it by your tone that this beast is not simply some interloping bullette?~
@9752 = ~'Ey there, Vico. Edwin's sweet on ye.~
@9753 = ~Then I see no further need to speak. It shall only make the battle all the harder.~
@9754 = ~They cannot make us do this, can they? To house us together that we might speak... then force us to fight... it is monstrous. Or do you taunt us?~
@9755 = ~And here would come the change in plans, am I right? Wondrously chaotic plan if it is. I expected no less.~
@9756 = ~To stave off your wrath they have provoked it beyond imagining. These are impressive risks they are willing to take.~
@9757 = ~An improvement, I think. One that you should relish as a brief glimpse of your betters.~
@9758 = ~To become such a hated thing... I do not look forward to that.~
@9759 = ~I've come for what you stole from me! I will not leave here empty! I will have my soul!~ [IMOEN68]
@9760 = ~Indeed, he has made enemies of most everyone he has met. It is with relief that I say I have rarely seen his equal in evil.~
@9761 = ~I have decided that I will not help you.~
@9762 = ~Yes, well, he's provoked himself right into a fireball when next we meet.~
@9763 = ~I was talking to him, not to you!  You've made your feelings on everything apparent enough!~ [AERIED3]
@9764 = ~I was just asking for his opinion... is that so bad, Jaheira?~ [AERIEE1]
@9765 = ~I will tell you what would make this journey more pleasant.  Not having to listen to the constant whimpering of a wounded dove.~ [VICONIC6]
@9766 = ~Oh, yes, I know!  I've seen you sizing him up like... like he's some piece of steak!  You think the rest of us don't know?~ [AERIED7]
@9767 = ~Oh, come now, child.  I have been listening to your simpering for quite some time, and it begins to grate on my nerves.  You are in this group to help, as I recall... pull yourself together!~ [JAHEIRF7]
@9768 = ~I am *not* your child!  I'm older than you are, more than likely!  And... and the only thing my 'simpering' does is distract you from those little looks you're always giving him!~ [AERIEE3]
@9769 = ~If I need to hear from our resident wingless pigeon, I will bang on a drum.  Otherwise, return to your pathetic cowering and let me speak.~ [VICONIC3]
@9770 = ~Well, for starters, he is far more worthy of my respect than a moaning cripple like yourself.  Perhaps you should flap helplessly a bit further away and allow your betters to speak.~ [VICONIC4]
@9771 = ~Naught but their names. The mage is Jon Irenicus. The girl is Imoen.~ [CSCOW706]
@9772 = ~This appears to be the statue described in the Vampiricus Omnibus.  The book spoke of placing the vampire and its master's heart within the statue's arms to destroy the curse.~
@9773 = ~If an entire elven city is gone it is a tragedy beyond measure!~
@9774 = ~Is there no more help you can offer? I will fight evil until the end but... but we have fought this fight before and were basically dismissed.~
@9775 = ~What?!  Nay, good mayor... ignore this lout.  If coin is all <HESHE> desires, the armor you provided can be sold for plenty.  I apologize on <HISHER> behalf.~
@9776 = ~You speak as if unaware of class distinction, and yet your manner exudes it.  A sign of immaturity... good, then, that <CHARNAME> is sending you ahead.~
@9777 = ~Take poor Jaheira there. I understand you have developed a relationship of sorts. It's so hard on couples when something happens to one of them, don't you agree?~
@9778 = ~I have no fear for his well being, monster.~
@9779 = ~She is lost to you, <CHARNAME>.  Jaheira has been quite receptive to my wiles.  I doubt your fumbling could have inspired the loyalty I have taken with a bite and a gaze.~
@9780 = ~You see, <CHARNAME>, she is now quite agreeable.  Of course it would have taken more time to fully turn her, but she is deadly enough as she is.~
@9781 = ~She is not even fully turned and yet she is mine to use against you. Perhaps your connection was not as strong as you might have thought?~
@9782 = ~His will is mine, even though he is not fully turned.  He will carve your heart out with but a word I say, and there is nothing you can do while I live.~
@9783 = ~Has Elhan not given you the holy water from our angered temple? I assure you, it is as potent as any can be.~
@9784 = ~I know of no cure for vampirism at this stage. Perhaps the followers of Oghma may have a tome in their collection that can help. I can offer no more than this.~
@9785 = ~That is most distressing. I wish I could give you happy news, but I cannot. Brace yourself for the worst, and do not hesitate to strike when you must.~
@9786 = ~I know of no cure. Seek the followers of Oghma, the god of knowledge. They might have a text on the subject, for they are great collectors of knowledge. That is all I can offer.~
@9787 = ~Legends of the Lanthorn maintain that it was perhaps once a mere carriage light, but that our ancestors did light the way to new lands with it at the fore of their processions.~
@9788 = ~You came to rescue me. I had not thought of myself worthy after suffering the taint of that vampire.~ [ANOMENC7]
@9789 = ~No, I do not need you just yet.~
@9790 = ~Please <CHARNAME>!~
@9791 = ~I knew you wouldn't let me down. You followed... and I'll follow you, <CHARNAME>. I'll follow wherever you lead.~
@9792 = ~No... no room? But I thought... you just said... never... never mind! Never mind what I thought.~
@9793 = ~Then this place is as much your tomb as it is mine. If my body, that... that thing... does not die, you shall never escape. Only my hand shall open the way. Thus has Bodhi ordained it.~
@9794 = ~Curse you!~
@9795 = ~There is a secret room near the Tome of Madness. Within, the shaman worships the shard, now grown. Use the stake to kill my body and get the hand.~
@9796 = ~The hand is half of the key! The crystal is the other! You shall know both when you find them. Find them not and you will die here.~
@9797 = ~I don't wish to alarm you, but Boo is absolutely fretting about your condition. Are you well? Fear in Boo is uncommon, and usually weasel-caused.~
@9798 = ~We can rest if you wish. I do not understand what Irenicus did, but Boo has said that it was traumatic and I will guard if we must stay here a while.~
@9799 = ~That is good.  I will guard if you need to rest.  It is the least I can do, since I could not stop Irenicus.~

@9879 = ~Victims of Imprisonment -- Svirfneblin Son.

I went to Therndle Daglefodd to tell him of how I rescued his child, and he was quite amazed. I was still under the Drow-form illusion, and he was astounded that Drow would come to his aid. He was most generous with his reward.~
@9880 = ~Victims of Imprisonment -- Svirfneblin Son.

I broke the news to Therndle Daglefodd about his son. I told him that I found his body in the tunnels, though I conveniently left out the part where I killed him. Tragic, just tragic. Therndle was glad to know the fate of his boy. It's so sad, it just chokes me up.~

@9897 = ~Yes, well, if you develop any useful skills I will be sure to call you. Leave me.~
@9898 = ~Worry not. I will be fine in a moment.~
@9899 = ~I thank you for your concern, but I don't think this odd feeling is immediately curable.~
@9900 = ~The look on your face reminds me of a cousin I had on the coast by the name of Milton Bottlesworth, who used to make a 'Shining Sea Ale' that would set your riptide to undertow, if you know what I mean. One night he made a particularly strong batch of brew that, for reasons that will become clear in a moment, he was destined to call 'Old One-Eye,'43'. I tell you, he got so involved in the tasting that he fell into the keg up to his ankles the wrong way around, and had to breathe through the spigot for three hours lest he drown in a watery tomb of his own making. Helpful Aunt Tildeberry came in later for a late night snifter and tried to unclog the spout with a hairpin, and you can imagine the fuss that emerged from that mess. An inch or two off-target and the mixture would have been the much less ominous 'Poke in the Nose, '43', but that's neither here nor there.~
@9901 = ~So anyway, what I mean to say is that you look like you've spent a night upside-down in a barrel of hooch thinking at least it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, only to have life cruelly prove you right.~
@9902 = ~Thanks for your concern, Korgan, but I'll manage just fine.~
@9903 = ~Aye, have it your way then. I'll be watching you though, in case you weaken any more. No telling what that ritual did to you.~
@9904 = ~I will be all right in a moment. Save your talents for later. We will surely need them.~
@9905 = ~Oh wonderful, now you are weakening in this darkest of moments! I knew I should have partnered with stronger party members.~
@9906 = ~I suppose having your soul ripped out will do that, but it's no excuse. We need to at least get me to safety. Then you can rest.~
@9907 = ~I would not get used to it. As powerful as you think you might be, you'll probably lose your mind along with your stolen soul.~
@9908 = ~By taking your soul, Irenicus has left you open to possession by the energies of a dead god! Not since the time of troubles have I felt such evil.~
@9909 = ~As much as I like having powerful friends, I don't want to be around when you lose your mind to such power.~
@9910 = ~Aunty used to tell me stories of the gods, what she learned while in school in Calimshan. She would talk about many things that scared me, but nothing like this.~
@9911 = ~You became the essence of Bhaal! An avatar of murder! <CHARNAME>, such power is not meant for mortals!~
@9912 = ~The bad parts... <CHARNAME>, have you done this befo... No, no I don't suppose you have.~
@9913 = ~You have channeled the power of a dead god through you and maintained enough will to tell about it. Count your blessings.~
@9914 = ~You have channeled a massive amount of energy from a divine source, and probably lost some of yourself in the process.~
@9915 = ~<CHARNAME>, Boo just soiled my backpack.~
@9916 = ~G-greetings, strangers, I hope that you are here to help in our hour of need... it is all I can do to keep these poor people from dying. These creatures must be stopped!~
@9917 = ~I was wondering, have you seen High Priestess of Rillifane, Demin? She left us to go amongst the creatures and find the relics from the temple... I worry for her!~
@9918 = ~Oh, I suppose I should be official about this... uh... You there! All citizens must stay indoors under threat of death.~
@9919 = ~Then she has told you about the relics, I hope! The avatar must be summoned if the palace is to be opened and these creatures stopped! Please... I beg of you, help us!~
@9920 = ~You must find her! She hoped to collect the relics to summon the avatar of Rillifane. Only He can stop these fiends and open the palace gates! Please... I beg you!~
@9921 = ~Svirfneblin Village Concerns.

I spoke with Goldander Blackenrock, Lord of the svirfneblin village. His pompous title revealed the shallow nature of his needs. He spoke of a means that I might enter the Drow city, by enlisting the aid of Adalon, a powerful creature that holds court at the base of the great staircase. Goldander wanted me to first perform a service for his village, defeating some creature that they had unearthed, and he offered to grant me access to Adalon as reward, giving me a glow stone or some such, so that I could pass through the darkness that protects her lair. I cut out the middleman and killed the lot of them.~
@9922 = ~Svirfneblin Village Concerns.

Goldander Blackenrock was thrilled that I killed the beast that had been threatening his village, but he reminded me that I must also collapse the cavern it is in with the earthquake scroll he gave me.~
@9923 = ~We saw the Exile fly in astride a terrible black dragon... its acid breath rained down even as elementals, golems, and demons appeared inside the walls!~
@9924 = ~I fought... as long as I could... against a creature made of fire. I was forced to retreat here with many others. You must stop them!  Save my people!~
@9925 = ~Elhan? Good to know, but I cannot take all these wounded to the gates... we are safe for the moment. These creatures must be stopped soon or we are all doomed!~
@9926 = ~Last we heard, the Exile entered the palace and sealed the gate. Nothing can break through. Queen Ellesime is within, as is the Tree of Life... no doubt his target.~
@9927 = ~We retreated here when it was obvious we couldn't stand against the Exile's creatures. Many of us died... now all we can hope is that the army gets through.~
@9928 = ~Svirfneblin Village Concerns.

Goldander was quite relieved that the creature would no longer be bothering his village, and he reaffirmed his gratitude by giving me a magic item as reward. He was, however, a little concerned that I had already pickpocketed the light gem that he had intended to give me. Oh well, as long as I got it.~
@9929 = ~Captured by Mind Flayers!

I could trust the Githyanki, but only to a point. Simyaz and his group are leaving me to fend for myself, and I will have to find my own means of escape.  They left after again chastising me for the theft of their Silver Sword, the weapon I got from Saemon Havarian.  Lacking the teleportational abilities of the Githyanki I could not follow when they left, and must now face the wrath of the illithid city on my own.~
@9930 = ~Captured by Mind Flayers.

I met the Githyanki again. I found them resting in a cavern, quite surprised to see that I had lived through the illithid city. I registered my displeasure by making them pay for their treachery with blood.~
@9931 = ~Many many pretties... piled high beyond the sky. (sigh)~ [PPNALJ09]
@9932 = ~Not at all, although the blade is a reminder of what Irenicus intended... for you and me both.~
@9933 = ~Perhaps not, but it is better to be alert to threats from absurd places than caught unawares.~
@9934 = ~I admit to being somewhat uneasy. Perhaps it is this blade. Yes, that's it. The weapon that Irenicus gave me, it reminds too much of what has occurred.~
@9935 = ~Boo does not favor the odds, but I have no doubt we will succeed!~
@9936 = ~This is a great evil we go to fight. I, for one, do not appreciate fighting battles for those that should stand for themselves.~
@9937 = ~Yes, declare your loyalty, Viconia. When you eventually betray us I will hold your statement up as proof of the untrustworthy nature of your kind.~
@9938 = ~The Elven city requires my aid.

Elhan has requested my service none too subtly.  To reach Irenicus I must first help the elves gain entry to their own city, Suldanessellar.  Irenicus has hidden it using illusionary magics of some sort that defy dispelling.  If we are to regain access, I have to retrieve the Rhynn Lanthorn, an artifact lantern that is attuned to the elven nation.  Elhan believes that someone powerful that follows Irenicus stole it from the desecrated elven temple, and I have a very clear idea just who that might be.  I will not receive help from the elves in tracking her, even though I am certain I am familiar with her old stomping ground.  Elhan has advised that he cannot follow with his battalions for risk of causing an even larger incident, this time with paranoid human forces.  He suggested that I seek out allies among the groups I have already met within human territories.~
@9939 = ~Paralytic Bolt

Any target hit by this bolt must making a saving throw or be paralyzed for five rounds.

STATISTICS:

Combat Ability: target must save vs. paralyzation or be stunned for five rounds
Damage:  1D10 
Damage type:  missile (piercing)
Weight:  1
Launcher:  Crossbow~
@9940 = ~With its defenses down, the parasite is easily dispatched.~
@9941 = ~Food! Irenicus has sent lunch at last. It is as well. I grow tired of this, treasure or no. Nizidramanii'yt is no pathetic soldier to stand guard duty over a tarnished cup.~
@9942 = ~Joneleth, the one you call Irenicus, he... is drawing power from the Tree of Life into himself. There are... parasites on the Tree draining it for him...~
@9943 = ~The Elven city requires my aid.

'A pane of elven origin is held amidst the servants of nature, in the grasp of the beasts that die to the fire.'~
@9944 = ~The Elven city requires my aid.

'Beneath the streets in human city, within the kingdom of the blind, the beast does not see what it has even now.'~
@9945 = ~Hah! What backwoods adventurer have you been listening to? What comes next? You try to convince me to turn against Irenicus by soothing my ego?!?~
@9946 = ~The Elven city requires my aid.

The Rhynn Lanthorn will now guide us into Suldanessellar. The majority of Elhan's elves will have to remain here to rout the Drow, meaning I will be left to deal with Irenicus and whatever he has unleashed upon the city.  Elhan has still not revealed the origins of Irenicus' hatred towards the elves, and has shed little light on why he refers to the mage as 'the Exile', saying only that the crime was great, the punishment greater.  Irenicus must have done something especially abhorrent to the elves.  Once in the city I will see if the high priestess Demin has any more information, if the city is intact at all.~
@9947 = ~Your wounds are many, elf. Give me the blade and I shall allow you to live.~
@9948 = ~Never! I shall gladly die to save the blade!~
@9949 = ~Rillifane! Grant me death and victory!~
@9950 = ~The lid holds five pressure plates, each adorned with symbols common to Suldanessellar: Rillifane, the Tree of Life, a rune of Suldanessellar, Corellan Lotharian (the father of the Elven Pantheon), and the elven Symbol of Water.

@9952 = ~Viconia, we're heading for a fight, and there's no need to endanger yourself.~
@9953 = ~4,000 as you wanted. Take it.~
@9954 = ~2,000 as you wished. Take it.~
@9955 = ~2,000 will be the price of my mercy. Pay it, or face the wrath of all that follow the Spider Queen. The city is more than willing to participate in a hunt!~
@9956 = ~Very well, here is your gold.~
@9957 = ~The door will be found in a closet... immediately to the right of the guild's door as ye enters.  Go, then... Aran Linvail will be expectin' ye.~ [GAELEN34]
@9958 = ~Boo concurs! We must hurry and dispense with this errandry so we can get to the fighting of greater evils more worthy of my bootprint!!~
@9959 = ~Minsc and Boo will protect your street, Aerie! You will cross it for your pleasure, not for fear of it!~
@9960 = ~I shall never again say this, but I believe we should hurry to Aran's task. If our enemy is his enemy, we may best achieve our goal by helping this guild.~
@9961 = ~Devils are devils, and this place is just as worthy of our wrath as of our help. Some other day and we would not be standing here speaking to these curs.~
@9962 = ~Shut up, Edwin. Your pompous tone disgusts me.~
@9963 = ~I question whether we serve an 'actual' nature in doing this, but I am not above choosing the lesser of two evils.~
@9964 = ~You, of all people, have no right to speak to me about such things. At least I serve the greater good, whereas you lost all your morals quite possibly at birth.~
@9965 = ~Child, you are pathetic. These petty snatch-purses are the weakest of evils, the provenance of children and beggars, more to be pitied, even though they deserve it not.~
@9966 = ~I am certain many are there deservedly. Yes, of that I am certain. Some must deserve it.~
@9967 = ~I have heard some in the Harpers speak of it. It is more than a prison or supposed asylum, it is a place to forget people that are 'troublesome'.~
@9968 = ~I did not mean to suggest anything contrary to what Mr. Linvail is saying. Just that some must deserve it. It seems such a brutal place.~
@9969 = ~Do what you must. I am resigned to the treachery I have suffered.~
@9970 = ~I believe it does... I can wither and die for failing to kill you, or I can fall in battle, and pray that my heart will find purchase with Ilmater.~
@9971 = ~You... you... low-browed barbarian!!~ [SARLES03]
@9972 = ~I see. Events took him further than he expected, and he suffered as he struggled between duty and conscience. I have seen such torment in souls before.~
@9973 = ~Very well, we shall take his heart unto the breast of Ilmater. The Crying God will determine what torment is deserved or not.~
@9974 = ~If there is suffering undeserved, this Yoshimo will see relief in his eternal rest.~
@9975 = ~Joneleth, the one you know as Irenicus, he... is drawing power from the Tree of Life into himself. There are... parasites attached to the Tree, draining it for him...~
@9976 = ~I do not know what manner of parasites these things are... but they are formed from corruption itself, I fear! They feed Joneleth the power and maintain my cage!~
@9977 = ~Do that and I can sever Jon's connection to the Tree. Then, and only then, may he be killed! I... believe he has protected the parasites somehow... I do not know. Hurry!~
@9978 = ~The energy he has stolen from the Tree will be torn from him. I know not what effects this will have... but Jon will be disoriented, so you must kill him quickly!~
@9979 = ~You are the only one I have encountered since I fled my homeland who has both taken my measure and given me quarter.  You have saved my life more than once, we have fought together and bled together... and more.~

@9986 = ~It looks about balefully, its ears folding back against its head in fear. "This... is a place where I am food. I do not like this place. We should go elsewhere."~
@9987 = ~As it thinks, its eyes glow red with uncharacteristic ferocity. "There is only one solution, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. For you to survive, the wizard must die. That is how it must be."~
@9988 = ~Did I accuse you of being one?  Certainly not.  Indeed, it is a grim vocation, and one I shy away from myself. It has, however, become necessary.~
@9989 = ~He is, indeed, a despicable person. Does that warrant his execution?~
@9990 = ~No... I wasn't finished...~ [SARLES05]
@9991 = ~I sees 'em taking people off their ship... slaves, of course... so I tells 'em they needs a 'license', right? An' of course they... hey! Hey! Are you still here?!~

@9993 = ~The medallion, fool?? You will die for your audacity! Lady Galvena shall receive your head as a trophy!~
@9994 = ~My thanks to you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, for saving a foolish wizard's life.  (sigh)  With my daughter now gone... I think I will leave, myself, for a while and consider what I have done.~
@9995 = ~Choose wisely then, as I can perform each of these tasks once and once only.~
@9996 = ~I give you then the ability to shapechange... use it wisely for it will not last forever.~
@9997 = ~Then all shall be healed.~
@9998 = ~Granted.  All will die of other afflictions, but not of the wounds they have.~
@9999 = ~Then I shall grant your wish and restore some of your lost spells.~

@10098 = ~I seek a means of curing a loved one I lost in a battle with his sister, Bodhi.~

@10102 = ~Together they sought more than was possible; they wished the power of the gods, and they were not concerned about the consequences.~

@10104 = ~The sister exposed herself to vampirism to try and counteract the divine curse, but gods are not routed so easily.  The brother did not risk the same.~
@10105 = ~Wow, what was your first clue, genius?~
@10106 = ~We had hoped this would turn out better.  The Exile has found a way to restore himself, has made pacts with our most despised enemies, and has resumed his original plot.~
@10107 = ~I seek him because of his restoration.  He has harmed me and those dear to me.~
@10108 = ~The Exile has seeded the streets with his minions, and taken Ellesime into the palace.  I have made an attempt to enter, but it is sealed tight.~
@10109 = ~There must be another way into the palace!  Or to get inside the gates!~
@10110 = ~We had a theft some time back, not long ago.  There were three books taken, each on a different subject dealing with vampirism.~
@10111 = ~I'm not too sure where they were acquired... hmm... I seem to recall that the Vampiricus Omnibus was bought from a dealer in Imnesvale, in the Umar Hills.~
@10112 = ~I don't know what else to say.  I would suggest that you read the Vampiricus Omnibus itself for the information you seek, but I do not have access to it myself.~
@10113 = ~The book would likely help you in your task.~
@10114 = ~Aye, that it has, though there have been quite a few old books turn up around here to make it worthwhile.  Nothing startling, but I get by.~
@10115 = ~I remember a text that had Vampiricus in the title, but I could nary read a word of it. Interesting look to it, and the followers of Oghma paid well, I believe.~
@10116 = ~He said he found the place after some fuss with a vampire, and he'd been looking for a cure for the bloodsucker, and he was running out of time and ... oh jehosaphat, he went on and on.~
@10117 = ~No you cannot.  My guild fulfills the services it promises, and theft protection is our specialty.  You will find no opportunity here.~
@10118 = ~You have?  Never mind me, then, my dear... go about your business.  But if you can help Raelis more than you have, it would do my heart good.~
@10119 = ~Imoen is of paramount importance.~
@10120 = ~My main interest is in finding out what Irenicus can do for me.~
@10121 = ~If you can eventually show light on what he was planning for me, I will be grateful.~
@10122 = ~There is no need for that... he and I have an understanding.  We have been through much together.  Be wary though.~
@10123 = ~I know that the power Irenicus promised was denied me because your thieves attacked!~
@10124 = ~The sword flashes for a moment, then sighs since you are not impressed with its magnificence.   "So are we gonna... kill something now?"~ [SSWORD50]
@10125 = ~"Oh, sure, get me all excited for nothin'," the sword snorts.  "So, are we gonna kill something soon?  How about now?  No?  How about, uh... now?  No?  Ummm... now? What about now?"~ [SSWORD51]
@10126 = ~The sword whistles incredulously.  "Advice, eh?  Hmmm... well, besides working on your swordsmanship... you know, besides that... uh, I'd have to think..."~ [SSWORD52]
@10127 = ~"I got it.  Oh, I knew I'd come up with it... I'm so sharp!  Kill everything!  Carnage! Slaughter!  Carve your way outta here and I'm gonna sing your praises!  Yah-hah!!"~ [SSWORD53]

@10137 = ~"I think you need to take better care of me.  I got more chips than a blind beaver... I look like a second-rate pig-poker!"~ [SSWORD63]

@10139 = ~"Well... uh, since you asked, I would like to register a complaint.  I want to kill a dragon.  Right now.  No, don't look.  Go kill one now. Go find one and kill it.  That's right: kill... now.  That would be SO cool!"~ [SSWORD65]
@10140 = ~"Ooh... I agree with the Rashemaar!  Give me to him, willya?  C'mon!  What a pair we'd make!  Oh, me the brains with the edge, him the brawn with the hamster!  A legend in the making..."~ [SSWORD66]
@10141 = ~So's I says, "is there a point to all of this," and he says, "if I'm gonna get full value for the book I gotta tell you what it says," and I says, "I don't care what it says, just shut up."  Cuz he was a real talker, right?~
@10142 = ~And he says it's all in the book, and it's something to do with the mayor's problems and that everyone will need to know and do you know what I says to him?  Do you know what I says?~
@10143 = ~She lost her parents to plague, her husband to war, but she persevered.~ [DPJON105]

@10164 = ~Well, ye've the blade of a sword, here, indeed.  But I would need both its pommel gem and the sword's hilt in order to forge it into one piece for ye.  A pity.~
@10165 = ~Hmmmn.  Aye, 'tis Gesen's work, indeed.  A string and a shaft both.  I could remake one of the great bowyer's short bows for ye.  'Tis a truly powerful weapon.~
@10166 = ~I'll keep looking, here, me friend.  Hmmmn...~
@10167 = ~Ye've a blade, here, fer a mighty halberd.  It seems t' have power of water... odd.  If ye can find the accompanying shaft I can forge it together for ye.~
@10168 = ~Hmmm... ye've the shaft and blade of a halberd.  Power of water in its elemental magic.  Most interesting.  If ye like, I could try to re-forge it for ye.~
@10169 = ~Well... it seems ye've the blade of a Silver Sword, here.  Not much good without the hilt, though.  Best be wary... the Gith won't be pleased if they catch ye with this.~
@10170 = ~Aye.  Ye've the hilt and blade of a vorpal Silver Sword.  If ye're willing to risk the wrath of the Gith, I'm willing to put it back together for ye.~
@10171 = ~I'll keep looking.  Hmmm... I see...~
@10172 = ~It be illithium, aye?   A rare metal, indeed.  If ye ever get ahold of a Mace of Disruption, a coating of illithium would improve it vastly.~
@10173 = ~Ye've illithium there, aye?  And a Mace of Disruption, as well.  I could apply a coating to yer mace and improve it greatly, giving ye more protection from the undead.~

@10175 = ~(ahem!)  You there, <RACE> <MANWOMAN>!  My freedom from limbo has a price: I must track down the thief of one of our most holy of holies.~
@10176 = ~You did?  Really?   You know, being a wild mage isn't all it's cracked up to be.  My mentor always said:  "See the spoon, see the spoon."  But I only saw frogs.~
@10177 = ~(sigh)  I'm trying very hard to communicate.  They chose me because I have the most experience with humans.  It got me out of limbo, and that's a GOOD thing.~
@10178 = ~No!  My name is Habib Khalid Ahmed Allafif, and I cannot be captured!  I will throw my mighty scimitar at your head rather than suffer the indignity of prison!  Hiiii-YAA!!~
@10179 = ~Oh... dear.  You really must forgive him.  He does that on occasion.~
@10180 = ~Thank you, <SIRMAAM>, I won't disappoint you.  Return every week and I'll give you the potions that I've made.~
@10181 = ~But... one question before you leave.  The warrior who stands with you... he bears a most remarked resemblance to Sir Keldorn Firecam.  It has been so long...~
@10182 = ~Worse yet, there are some kind of snake creatures with them.  I had never seen the like of them before, but I've been sheltered most of my life.~

@10192 = ~Katana +3
To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

This is the true name that the dwarven weaponsmith, Silverblade, gave to the weapon he intended to create for his son.  Alas, his son died before the weapon was ever completed, but here it stands complete... forged from the combined magic of the original hammer with the Gauntlets of Ogre Power and a Girdle of Frost Giant Strength.  Crom Faeyr gifts its users with all the powers of the original Hammer of Thunderbolts, in addition to enormous strength and the ability to kill golems, ettins and trolls in one blow.

@10218 = ~Long Sword: The Equalizer
Such is the age of this sword that its true origin has been lost to time, but markings hint that it was possibly forged in the service of Helm.  Also called the "Sword of Neutrality", it seems designed to seek and terminate extremes, to shift the universe closer to harmonious equilibrium.  The further the behavior of a target from true balance, the more potent the damage they suffer.

@10221 = ~Mace of Disruption +2
This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead.  Any such creature hit by it not only feels the sting of weapon, but also has a chance of being simply blasted from existence.  There are legends that speak of a priest so holy a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.
Now that the mace has been coated with illithium, it is even more potent, conferring to its user immunity to the life-draining powers of the more powerful undead.

The great depths of the Underdark stretch before you, and as you adjust to the dim light, the reality of where you are begins to sink in.  It is a realm of countless legends, where evil lurks behind each shadow, and though you have traveled far in pursuit of Irenicus, never have you felt so isolated.  As black as your situation may have seemed, it somehow grows darker still.~ [CHAPT05]
@10254 = ~CHAPTER SEVEN

Guided by the light of the Rhynn Lanthorn, you pass effortlessly through what had seemed an impenetrable wall of trees.  The city that greets you as you emerge is at once inspiring, but also profoundly troubling, for amidst the majestic architecture are dozens of bodies, elves that have fallen while defending their home.  Suldanessellar is in the grip of Irenicus and his minions, and it will not be relinquished without a fight.~ [CHAPT07]

@10260 = ~Dak'kon's Zerth Blade +2
This sword was the weapon of choice of the famous githzerai Dak'kon.  Dak'kon was killed by a powerful entity while working for a creature known as the 'Nameless One'. Perhaps the strange circumstances of his death preserved this blade, as it would otherwise have lost its form when his will no longer shaped it.

Retrieve the STAR SAPPHIRE for Belt.~


@10284 = ~This paper seems to be the hastily scribbled journal of the thief Tizzak. One passage draws your eye:

I have discovered that Aran's inner sanctum is protected by two magical doors. They can be neither picked nor bashed. The first requires a button, the second, a key.

The button can be found somewhere to the north, at the end of a heavily trapped hallway. 

As to the key, I know not where it is but I do know that Aran's most trusted advisor is a wizard called Haz. He may have a key if he is in the compound.~

@10300 = ~Allow me to introduce myself properly.  I am Brother Odren, currently the leader of the Knights of the Vigil.  We are... a small sect that was given a most solemn charge by the Vigilant One, Helm, Himself.~

@10302 = ~Watcher's Keep

Brother Odren of the Knights of the Vigil has sent out a call for those capable of entering the Watcher's Keep... an ancient prison holding a great evil imprisoned there by the god Helm, himself.  The evil is close to breaking the seals of its prison and becoming free.  The Knights would enter the Keep and perform a ritual to fix those seals, but cannot as they are too weak to bypass the traps and monsters within.

Odren suggests that I, too, am not yet ready to enter the Keep just yet.  I shall return another time when my experience is greater.~
@10303 = ~You lay the book face up on the altar, but it slams itself shut.  You realize you cannot continue the ritual until you somehow discover the proper page to which you must open the book.~

The evil is close to breaking the seals of its prison and becoming free.  The Knights would enter the Keep and perform a ritual to fix those seals, but cannot as they are too weak to bypass the traps and monsters within.

I refused Odren's request to enter the Keep and fix his problem, although he asked that I reconsider... if this evil escapes, he says, no one shall be safe.~
@10306 = ~Watcher's Keep

Brother Odren of the Knights of the Vigil has sent out a call for those capable of entering the Watcher's Keep... an ancient prison holding a great evil imprisoned there by the god Helm, himself.  The evil is close to breaking the seals of its prison and becoming free.  The Knights would enter the Keep and perform a ritual to fix those seals, but cannot as they are too weak to bypass the traps and monsters within.

I have accepted the task of entering the Keep and fixing the seal that keeps this evil imprisoned.  It may be a long task... the Keep is large and quite dangerous... but Odren says there is still some time before the remaining seals are broken.  It must be done, however, or this creature will be freed and endanger all.~
@10307 = ~Guests! Welcome to my domain. No doubt you seek a challenge. But are you worthy of it, or merely fools?  We shall soon see.~
@10308 = ~I shall prove my worth to you, imp.  I await your challenge.~
@10309 = ~I'm sick of games and puzzles and tests.~
@10310 = ~So very, very wrong.  Obviously you need a hint.  Very well: be aware that I am female.  Now, one last chance.  I suggest you get it right, or you'll be very, very sorry.~
@10311 = ~Correct.  Perhaps you are a worthy mental adversary, despite your doltish appearance.  But to complete this challenge, you must beat me at a game of coins.~
@10312 = ~The rules are simple.  Here are 11 coins.  We alternate turns, taking 1,2 or 3 coins at a time.  Whoever takes the last coin loses.  A simple game to learn, but a difficult one to master.~
@10313 = ~Well played.  I will take 1 coin.  There are 8 left, and it is your move.~
@10314 = ~Just 3 coins remain.  Obviously, I will take 2 of them.~
@10315 = ~Let me see... 4 coins left.  Give me these 3 coins, and the match is over!~
@10316 = ~You may have won, but I'm not going to stick around here and listen to your gloating!~
@10317 = ~Unlike the other rooms, there appear to be no monsters in here. The runes inscribed on the floor and walls just inside the door to this room are similar to those at the main entrance to the temple.~
@10318 = ~Watcher's Keep

The Imprisoned One held within the vault that is Watcher's Keep turned out to be none other than Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, himself.  I was able to defeat the creature and send it back to the Abyss... and then confront Odren outside of the Keep.  He admitted that he had known of Demogorgon's presence... his plan had been for me to seal myself inside the prison along with the demon instead of them.  Odren was remorseful for his blatant cowardice, however, and I decided not to seek retribution.~

Odren was remorseful for his blatant cowardice, but I was not about to allow such a slight to pass without retribution.  I had defeated the Prince of Demons... Odren and his Helmites would be less than a match for me, and hopefully a message to the rest of Faerun not to treat me similarly.~
@10320 = ~Strong gusts of air whip down the corridor to pull and tug at your clothing, nearly knocking you off your feet.~

@10322 = ~The cold air spilling from the room into the hall chills your bones, numbs your joints and stiffens your armor, making movement difficult.~
@10323 = ~Within the obviously magical walls of this prison is a demon whose color and appearance constantly shift and change.  Evenly spaced around the cage, there are four slots in the floor into which a rod or staff could possibly be placed.~
@10324 = ~More suicidal fanatics willing to die in the service of Helm, I see.  Or have you been forced into service, as I once was a millennium ago?~ [GORCHR07]
@10325 = ~Listen, friend.  We can help each other.  The fact of the matter is, you cannot get through the gate to the next level unless I open it for you.~ [GORCHR09]
@10326 = ~So I'm not going to let you through the gate unless you help me end the enchantment that has kept me bound in this infernal dungeon for the last thousand years!  Do we have a deal?~ [GORCHR10]
@10327 = ~After a thousand wasted years, I'm finally free!  And now to spread some seriously bloody carnage to make up for lost time. Oh, where shall I start? Where shall I start? Oh... I think I'll start with you!~ [GORCHR14]
@10328 = ~I am imprisoned, but I am not the "Imprisoned One."  Obviously you are not one of those fanatical Knights of the Vigil, or you would already know that.~
@10329 = ~And you succeeded in what should have been our duty.  We are disgraced in the eyes of Helm.  To think that you... a Bhaalspawn... were less worthy.  It is a great misdeed.  Can you forgive a foolish man?~
@10330 = ~Watcher's Keep

After making my way through the treacherous levels of the Watcher's Keep, I discovered the Imprisoned One to be none other than Demogorgon, Prince of Demons, himself.  I performed the ritual to re-seal his prison... and tricked the demon into allowing me to leave the prison to lure Odren and the Knights within.  I did not... Demogorgon remains imprisoned and Odren has left with the Knights to atone for their abandonment of their calling in trying to manipulate me.~
@10331 = ~Watcher's Keep

I performed the ritual to re-seal his prison... and tricked the demon into allowing me to leave the prison to lure Odren and the Knights within.  I did not... Demogorgon remains imprisoned and I have taken my retribution upon the Knights of the Vigil for the part they played in trying to manipulate and imprison me.  Perhaps this will be a lesson to others who think of doing the same.~
@10332 = ~I believe there are five separate levels within the Keep, the fifth of which is the lower vault that allows access to the Imprisoned One, himself.  Each will have a seal that prevents access to the next level.~
@10333 = ~Who I am and where I come from are none of your business.~
@10334 = ~The Knight, Odren, has not been honest with thee... thou knowest this.  The ritual repairs the old seals, trapping the Imprisoned One as well as the one who reads the ritual.~ [GORAPP05]
@10335 = ~Odren intended it be thee to sacrifice thy life, rather than make his own sacrifice willingly.  He also failed to tell thee the scope of the evil that lies within... the Imprisoned One is Demogorgon, Prince of Demons.~ [GORAPP06]
@10336 = ~Odren cannot win in the battle below against the demon.  The ritual is Odren's... with his death, Demogorgon will be free to leave the Watcher's Keep.  Imagine, if thou wilst, what such a creature would do, then.~ [GORAPP07]
@10337 = ~Thou hast three options.  One is to leave... I cannot deny thee this right.  The second is to rescue Odren below.  Thou dost owe him nothing, it is true, and battling the Prince is a deadly task.~
@10338 = ~Helm the All-Seeing has granted me a scroll... a version of the ritual you carried before.  But this is Helm's own.  It may be used to seal both Odren and Demogorgon within, and you need not enter the Keep to do so.~
@10339 = ~Take this ritual scroll as the Watcher's... apology... to thee, Child of Bhaal, for the disobedience of His followers.  The choice, however, is still ultimately thine.  What dost thou wish?~
@10340 = ~Why don't you just use the scroll yourself?~
@10341 = ~I cannot use the scroll, Bhaalchild.  I have no existence beyond this shade... and Helm offers the scroll to thee, alone, so that the ancient prison might be resealed... should that be thy choice.~
@10342 = ~Forget it, then.  This doesn't concern me... I'll be leaving, now.~
@10343 = ~About ten years ago I was an adventurer, much like you.  I came with my apprentices to explore this dungeon, seeking fame and fortune.  What I found was this machine, the most amazing creation I'd ever seen.~
@10344 = ~You must mean that strange machine you're in.  What is it?~
@10345 = ~Take the scroll... and should you wish to use it, do so out here in the open outside of the prison.  Read it aloud and thou art done, all entrances to the prison will be sealed.~
@10346 = ~Thou art valiant to declare such, Bhaalchild... with luck, thy power will be equal to the task.  Should that not be so... I shall entrust Helm's scroll with thee, regardless.~
@10347 = ~Go with Helm's blessing, Child of Bhaal.  Be safe... and be wary of thy destiny.~
@10348 = ~Trapped?  You misunderstand:  this glass protects me.  It makes me impervious to harm.  I need neither food nor sustenance.  Even the ravages of time can no longer touch me.  I have become immortal!~
@10349 = ~No - spare me, please! (sob!)  I beg you, don't hurt me!  I never meant any harm!  It was all the machine's fault, I tell you! (sob!) I'm just a poor old man who got stuck inside a glass case.~ [GORCAR10]
@10350 = ~Not so "magnificent" now, are you?  Get out of my sight, you sniveling worm.~
@10351 = ~I won't kill you, Carston, even though you deserve to die for what you've done.  But I'm a better person than you'll ever be.~
@10352 = ~Thank you, kind <SIRMAAM>!  You are truly noble for sparing my wretched life!  Take my journal - it may help you discover the secrets to this infernal machine.~
@10353 = ~Well, I'm not going down without a fight!!~
@10354 = ~If you cannot help me then just get out of my sight, you cry-baby.~
@10355 = ~You do not see anything physical within the chamber... but you feel its presence all around you.  A phantasmal hand brushes your cheek, a curious gesture that startles you and is gone just as quickly.~
@10356 = ~I... meant no disrespect, Imprisoned One.  I was sent to perform a task, that is all.~
@10357 = ~Carston seems to be encased in some type of casing made of indestructible glass.~
@10358 = ~Impressions assault your mind briefly... knowing amusement combined with bitterness and images that your mind's eye refuses to recognize and turns away from.  Deeper impressions instill a sense of one name that the being prefers... one that applies to you and it both: prisoner.~
@10359 = ~Impressions again flood through your mind... it knows why you have come and warns you that you will join it in its imprisonment unless you are smarter than those who sent you.~
@10360 = ~I want answers - NOW!~
@10361 = ~Smarter than... the Knights of the Vigil?  Explain yourself!~
@10362 = ~Low power suddenly thrums throughout the room as the presence gains a measure of respect for your willingness to listen.  Faint anger and outrage flood through you, directed towards something other than yourself.  It is simple, your mind interprets... you are being deceived.~
@10363 = ~Please, just a few questions.~
@10364 = ~Another image forms in your mind, and you recognize dour men in armor... and further, behind them, lurks a sinister purpose.  Helmites, you are told, the Knights of the Vigil.  There is bitterness and anger in the presence as it conveys its unjust imprisonment by a sect who do not worship Helm at all, but secretly take succor from Helm's darkest enemies.  You are told that this is why the Imprisoned One is kept here, to keep their secret.~
@10365 = ~Carston was... my master.  He brought me, and his other apprentices, to this horrid place many years ago, seeking long forbidden knowledge buried within the depths of this dungeon.~
@10366 = ~He led us through the traps and guardians of the upper levels of the dungeon.  When we came across the Machine of Lum the Mad, he knew it was the only way to open the gate to the lower dungeon.~
@10367 = ~Carston was foolish enough to think he could master the machine.  He studied the controls, then flipped a switch - and was instantly encased in that magic shell of glass.~
@10368 = ~Before we apprentices could come to his aid, that idiot Carston flipped another switch.  Instantly we were surrounded by a horde of ravaging demons from another plane.~
@10369 = ~My companions were not so lucky.  Torn limb from limb by demons, or burnt into ash by the magic of that infernal machine.  Yet Carston was unharmed, completely protected inside his glass bubble.~
@10370 = ~I knew that machine was the key to getting out of here!~
@10371 = ~Oh, look at the time!  I should really be going now.~
@10372 = ~Less talk, more fight!  Time to die.~
@10373 = ~Why are you so hateful towards Carston?~
@10374 = ~Why do you hate Carston so much?~
@10375 = ~An alien chuckling rings through your head as the presence draws closer.  It smells murder on you and names you as the spawn of Bhaal... a being to be feared.  What better a pawn for the false Helmites to send for this task?  Why imprison only one dangerous being?  Why not imprison two?~
@10376 = ~I shall read the scroll, then... I trust you less than anything else.~
@10377 = ~Fine, then.  But I will deal with you directly... show yourself, so I may end your existence!~
@10378 = ~The images in your mind take on a dangerous glint as the air suddenly electrifies.  You are warned quite clearly that demanding such a thing is dangerous.  Peaceful talk is preferable, but the Imprisoned One seems perfectly willing to appear... if that is what you truly wish.~
@10379 = ~Githyanki, arm!  Invaders to lair!  Not Illithid, but agents?  Or seek you gold beyond the double doors, the hoard of The Ancient?~
@10380 = ~Yes.  I am a representative from the illithids, come to negotiate a peace.~
@10381 = ~The swirling images clarify suddenly, overwhelming your mind with a strong sensation of evil... it crawls along your consciousness like the blackest of oils.  The stench of sulphur and sweet carrion fill the room as a form begins to take shape before you.~
@10382 = ~One last, fleeting thought comes... words from an ancient evil so alien to your awareness that communication is barely possible.  But this thought sears into your consciousness clearly...

'Know me then by my best name, mortal.  You face Demogorgon, Prince of Demons.'~ [DEMOG07]
@10383 = ~The feelings in your mind grow suddenly hopeful.  You are told that the Imprisoned One wishes only its own freedom.  A further impression follows it... the wish for the presence to get revenge for the wrong done to it.  And a chance for you to gain revenge for being manipulated, as well.~
@10384 = ~Greetings, puny one.  I am Saladrex.  I assumed the disturbance I heard earlier was another attack by the mind flayers, but I see now that you must have been the cause.  It is nice to see a new mouse stumble into my lair.~ [GORDRA07]
@10385 = ~Puny one?  Mouse?  I am <GABBER> - a hero of great renown!  Try to be civil, or I shall have to teach you some manners.~
@10386 = ~I don't trust you... I'm going to read the scroll.~
@10387 = ~You get the impression of a definite promise from this being.  If revenge is not enough, once the Imprisoned One is free it will have power to offer whatever you wish.  Images of wealth and magic... as well as an offer of information on your godly heritage and its true powers...~
@10388 = ~None of these things interest me... but neither does helping the Knights.  I'm leaving.~
@10389 = ~The presence withdraws from your mind, watching you warily... but says nothing.~
@10390 = ~A series of images take you a moment to understand.  The Imprisoned One wishes you to go to the leader of the Knights... tell him that you have destroyed it.  He will wish to enter the Keep to confirm this.  The Imprisoned One will kill him... and with his death it shall be free at long last.  The false Helmites will be destroyed and justice shall be done.~
@10391 = ~No... I will not be manipulated by you.  I will read the scroll and be done with it.~
@10392 = ~No, I will not take part in your plan.  Show yourself, whatever you are... I shall destroy you here and now.~
@10393 = ~Watcher's Keep

I have encountered the Imprisoned One after opening the final seal and listened to its story of false imprisonment by the Knights of the Vigil and its offer of revenge and reward for its freedom.  According to it, the Knights had planned for me to be sealed up in this place along with the Imprisoned One... something that strikes me as having the ring of truth.  In order to free the Imprisoned One, I will have to go to Odren and tell him that the Imprisoned One is dead... Odren will investigate and the Imprisoned One will kill him.~
@10394 = ~Feelings of faint surprise creep through your mind.  The presence asks if you no longer intend to read the scroll... with clear hope it suggests that perhaps now you are willing to act against the false Helmites?~
@10395 = ~No, not really.  I just want to fight.~
@10396 = ~Fine.  Tell me, Saladrex:  how did you ever end up in a place like this?~
@10397 = ~A dragon with an ego - what a shock.  Very well.  How did you end up in this dungeon, oh most wondrous of lizards?~
@10398 = ~My story is truly a grand tale!  Of course, every story about me is going to be grand simply by virtue of the main character.~ [GORDRA11]
@10399 = ~The currents in the room waver as feelings of resentment laced with amusement wash over you.  You interpret the sensations as the Imprisoned One's congratulations... the seals are renewed.  It tells you to attempt to exit, now... and to come back to it when you fail.~
@10400 = ~I have only been here a few years, an insignificant time for a dragon.  But I choose to remain for a number of reasons.  For one, I find the antics of Carston and the other lesser creatures on this level amusing.~
@10401 = ~Images flow through your mind as the presence considers.  It offers that there are two ways to exit.  The first is to listen to its offer.  The second is to destroy it... without the Imprisoned One, the presence imagines that the prison would be once again open.  Behind this feeling is muffled amusement.~
@10402 = ~The presence is now far more intent, hope seizing upon opportunity.  You have been deceived, you are told... you know that now.  Deceived by the unworthy false Helmites, just as they imprisoned it.  It wishes to be free... and it also wishes revenge.~
@10403 = ~More images flood in, telling you that the Imprisoned One has been slowly marshaling its power to free itself... a process that would take an eon all told.  But it has enough power now to open the smallest of holes in the seal... not enough for it, but enough for you.~
@10404 = ~Pleased images swirl in your mind, telling you to go to the Knights of the Vigil and tell their leader that the Imprisoned One is destroyed.  Then it may have its revenge.  With his death, it will be free... and it will reward you handsomely.  Indeed... various fleeting images hint to you that it has knowledge of how to unlock the powers of Bhaal within you.~
@10405 = ~I don't like the implication in that look you give me when you mention thieves.~
@10406 = ~Perhaps I am paranoid, <GABBER>.  The Machine of Lum the Mad has had some small effect on all the creatures trapped in here.  We sometimes behave irrationally.~
@10407 = ~The presence is pleased and hopeful that you will keep your word.  An image forms in your mind that you are to leave through the door on this level... the Imprisoned One will ensure that the seal is clear for you.~
@10408 = ~Watcher's Keep

Odren has entered the Keep to confront Demogorgon, and will no doubt be killed in the process.  An apparition appeared and offered me a scroll from Helm, Himself, which will allow me to seal both Demogorgon and the unfaithful Odren inside the Keep forever.  I accepted it... and have only to use the scroll anywhere in the area outside of the prison... then the Imprisoned One's Lair will be sealed forever.~
@10409 = ~Watcher's Keep

I have discovered that the ritual to keep the Imprisoned One sealed, here, has done the same to me, as well... something that the Knights of the Vigil hardly could have not known about.  I have agreed to help free the Imprisoned One, who wants revenge as well and has agreed to open a small hole in the seal so I may escape... in order to free it, I will have to go to Odren and tell him that the Imprisoned One is dead... Odren will investigate and the Imprisoned One will kill him.~
@10410 = ~Various sensations from the presence tell you that this is true... but there is an undertone of faint amusement.  The other way out, it suspects, is to destroy it.  Without the Imprisoned One within, no doubt the prison will open.~
@10411 = ~The presence appears again, wondering if you have changed your mind yet... or perhaps you have found some other means of leaving?~
@10412 = ~The presence is faint and tersely informs you to leave while you can... it cannot maintain the hole in the seal for long.~
@10413 = ~An interesting question, indeed!  I do have some knowledge of this matter.  The crystal mallet is the key.  Strike it against Carston's cage six times and the glass will dissolve.~
@10414 = ~Watcher's Keep

Odren has entered the Keep to confront Demogorgon, and will no doubt be killed in the process.  An apparition appeared and offered me a scroll from Helm, Himself, which will allow me to seal both Demogorgon and the unfaithful Odren inside the Keep forever.  I declined to use it, though the apparition gave it to me anyway... it need only be used in front of the door that leads to Demogorgon.  Instead, I intend to go and confront the Demon Prince, myself.~
@10415 = ~I know a little of this matter.  The torches must be fueled by the oils found in the colored vats.  I suspect there is a specific pattern which must be followed, but I cannot say for sure.~

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 4 Rounds 
Casting Time: 8 
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a giant disembodied hand to squeeze and constrict the target once per round for up to four rounds. It initially smashes the target for 3D6 damage with no save. The target is held. In the second round, the target can save vs. paralyzation at -2 to escape. If they fail to save, the hand does 4D6 damage. The following round, the target can save vs. paralyzation with no penalty. If they make the save, they are free to move, if they fail, the spell does 6D6 damage and holds them for 2 rounds. After the 4th round, the spell is finished. Magic resistance will stop the spell.~

@10421 = ~We tanar'ri have been drawn here to this interminable maze... and we know not why.  Try though we might, the planes be closed to us.~ [GORTAN09]
@10422 = ~But the baatezu be strong, indeed... it has been a challenge to... hmmm.  Perhaps thou, mortal, might... nay.  Nay, thou hast the stench of order and good on thee.  Best to kill thee now and be done with it.~
@10423 = ~But the baatezu be strong, indeed... it has been a challenge to... hmmm.  Perhaps thou, mortal, might play a part in this.  Dispatch the hated baatezu, Ka'rashur, and I would reward thee handsomely.~
@10424 = ~Thou art a most intelligent being... for a mortal.  The baatezu pit fiend, Ka'rashur, may be found elsewhere in this maze.  I cannot tell thee where, exactly.  Good hunting, fleshing!~
@10425 = ~Is this so?  What a grand day this would be... if it is true.  Bring me the heart of that pit fiend, fleshling, and I shall reward thee handsomely for it.  Something of magic... and our gratitude.~
@10426 = ~Forget it... I'd rather destroy you here and now.~
@10427 = ~Mmmm... most excellent of thee, fleshling.  You have earned the gratitude of the tanar'ri.  Odd, however, that we still cannot open our gate.  Bah!  Here is your reward... now begone and leave us be.~ [GORTAN11]
@10428 = ~Bigby's Crushing Hand (Evocation) 
Level: 9
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 3 Rounds 
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a huge disembodied fist that crushes the target and pins them to the ground. In the first round, the spell does 2D10 damage. The victim can save at -4 vs. paralyzation to avoid being pinned. If they fail, the hand does 3D10 damage the next round. The victim can again save vs. paralyzation at -2. If they fail to save, the hand does a final 4D10 damage and disappears.

@10429 = ~Wish 
(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)
Level: 9
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.  Lastly, the wiser the wizard, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen.  Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.

@10430 = ~No I don't... but I intend to get it soon.~
@10431 = ~We will not harm thee, little mortal.  But we be busy finding our gate, now... begone before I have a change of heart.~ [GORTAN13]
@10432 = ~Ahh... betrayal comes as no surprise to demons made only of lies...~ [GORBAT08]
@10433 = ~Ahhh... (hiss)  ... a mortal new, a fleshling true.  With you there is no Blood War; speak, mortal, and stay your sword...~ [GORBAT10]
@10434 = ~To this maze we have been brought, led by the force we long have sought.  We wish to return to Baator again... but our attempts to Gate are all in vain.~ [GORBAT12]
@10435 = ~But the tanar'ri be too strong; our battles are many and long.  Perhaps you, mortal, might... nay.  I sense you are too good to rid us of the hated brood.  Best kill you now before trouble you become.~
@10436 = ~But the tanar'ri be too strong; our battles have been many and long.  You have great power, mortal, it is true...  kill the baalor, Tahazzar, and be rewarded by the baatezu.~ [GORBAT14]
@10437 = ~Magic is plentiful in Baator, you see, and while I cannot go there I may draw things to me.  Something sufficient will be given to you... plus the goodwill of the baatezu.~
@10438 = ~Ahhh... (hissss) ... it is always good to meet intelligent mortals.  The Baalor, Tahazzar, is in this maze.  Search the portals.~
@10439 = ~(hisssss)  ... I see.  Then die quickly.~
@10440 = ~This tanar'ri you speak of... I have already destroyed the demon, I believe.~
@10441 = ~How grand that would be... if you speak true.  Bring his heart to me, mortal, and I shall reward you.  An item of power... and the goodwill of the baatezu.~
@10442 = ~I will be pleased to have the heart soon... ah, to cause the tanar'ri ruin.~
@10443 = ~This tanar'ri you speak of... I have already destroyed the demon, and I have its heart, here.~
@10444 = ~You have the heart of the baalor!  You have our gratitude forever more.  (hisss)  Strange, though, that we still cannot gate... perhaps the tanar'ri had naught to do with our fate?~ [GORBAT15]

@10492 = ~You look around you with your spirit warrior eyes, and find yourself in what is obviously a dungeon.  Implements of torture hang from the walls, and there is a pile of bones in the corner of the room.~

@10509 = ~A rabid gibberling rushes from the shadows to attack you, its small body a mere blur of fur and teeth.  It moves with such furious speed that retreat is not an option.~
@10510 = ~You sense an ominous presence beyond the archway to the west, and an iron chest stands against the north wall.~
@10511 = ~The chest is too heavy for the spirit warrior to lift.  The iron construction makes it impossible to break into, and the lid is locked.  Without a key, there is no hope of opening this chest.~
@10512 = ~Using the iron key you found earlier, you unlock the lid of the chest.  Inside is a blue potion.  Instinctively, the body of the spirit warrior seizes the potion and drinks it down, causing your wounds to heal greatly.~
@10513 = ~The smell of ancient death permeates this room.  Standing upright against the far wall is a stone crypt with an archway leading into darkness.  Carved over the archway is a hand with a single, unblinking eye gazing out from the palm - the symbol of Helm.~

@10517 = ~No?  I have a gem, here.  Its magic has something to do with the broken portal.  I'll wager it for the way out of here.~
@10518 = ~Well, here's something to entice you.  I have a gem... I believe its magic has something to do with the broken portal behind me.  I'll wager it for the way out of this place.~
@10519 = ~It's rather simple, actually.  We'll use the rules established by the renowned match between Tandem the Sensate and Bal'evoreth in Sigil.~
@10520 = ~Well, first you must offer a wager.  A tiny portion of your soul, like... hmmm... experience or vitality.  Or wager whatever allows me to leave this place.~
@10521 = ~Keep in mind, though, that I'll only wager the gem for the way out of here.  And, don't worry... whatever it is, you'll get it back when I go.~
@10522 = ~As you wish.  Alright, my friend... I shall allow you to draw from the deck first.~
@10523 = ~'Strife'?  A decent draw, although I wonder what the effect will be.~
@10524 = ~Ahhh... the 'Emperor'!  A very good draw, my friend... and a beneficial card.~
@10525 = ~'Strength'.  An extremely high suit.  I wonder, though, whether this represents growing stronger... or a lack of strength?  A curse, perhaps?  Do you have a means of breaking curses, mortal?~
@10526 = ~You turn and flee in terror, but not before the ghost brushes you with its bony finger, numbing your body with the chill touch of the grave.~
@10527 = ~Interesting.  Most interesting.  The Genasi was a genius, if you ask me.~ [GORCAM11]
@10528 = ~Now, of course it is my turn.  You may wish to step back... just in case.~
@10529 = ~'Triumph'?  Ahhhh... I sense a fight oncoming.  Give me a few moments, my friend.~
@10530 = ~So... that is it?  A dangerous game, and yet it seems we have survived relatively unscathed, yes?~ [GORCAM12]
@10531 = ~You wagered some of your vitality... I shall take my prize now.  And, no... you may not have it back.  Return if you wish to play again.~
@10532 = ~You wagered some of your experience... I shall take my prize now.  And, no... you may not have it back. Return, if you wish to play again.~
@10533 = ~I have won my freedom!  The way out of here is mine!   You may have the gem, regardless... it means nothing to me, now.  May I have my prize?~
@10534 = ~Thank you!  For a Prime, you aren't so bad.  Come, my minions... let us return to the planes before someone actually begins to miss us!  Onwards!~ [GORCAM13]
@10535 = ~I'm willing to play another game, certainly.  But this time I will only play for the way out of here... in exchange for the gem.  What do you say?~
@10536 = ~I see.  Well, I suppose I can wait until you retrieve it.  I *would* like to get out of here at some point... and better sooner than later, eh?~
@10537 = ~The Gambling Cambion

I have encountered a Cambion and his retinue inside of the maze.  This one seems friendly enough and is mostly interested in gaming with me for a chance at his freedom from this place.  In return for me putting up the holy symbol as stakes, he is willing to offer me a gem he has found... all based off of draws from a Deck of Many Things.~
@10538 = ~The Gambling Cambion

The Cambion with an urge to play games of chance with his Deck of Many Things wasn't about to let me walk out of here with Helm's holy symbol... his key to freedom.  The matter ended in violence, as it usually does... a bad gamble on his part.~

I have agreed to do a job for a tanar'ri baalor named Tahazzar to find a baatezu pit fiend named Ka'rashur elsewhere in this maze and to destroy it... and then return to Tahazzar with its heart.  He has promised me not only a material reward but also the goodwill of the tanar'ri.~

History of the Imprisoned One:  

He also serves who stands and waits and watches carefully.

Such is the lesson of the Great Guard, Helm of the Unsleeping Eyes.  
Let the events of this forgotten temple serve as an example to all who would follow the Vigilant One.  Beneath this hallowed earth the avatar of the Watcher confronted great evil, a Prince of the Underplanes. 

Through steadfast perseverance Helm, Guardian of the Gods, fulfilled his sacred duty and bound the creature in the bowels of the temple that it might walk the world no more.

Speak not the beast's name, ye Knights of the Vigil, but guard this place.  Protect the wards which seal the Imprisoned One within, and remain ever watchful.

Never betray your trust - such is the will of Helm.

Regrettably, the old priest could not remember the Holy Passage to be read during today's service.  His noble soul is willing, yet his aging mind fails him in his hour of need.

@10601 = ~I wish to make a deal, naturally.  I have little to lose, dear '<PRO_BROTHERSISTER>'... and plenty to gain.  As do you.  And I have waited in your home a considerable time to parley with you.~
@10602 = ~You are within our father's abyssal realm, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.  That plane once ruled by Bhaal and now shaped by the taint present in your soul... but no longer present in mine.  You have been here before.~
@10603 = ~This is a... a cocoon, of sorts.  A miniature version of our father's larger realm, sort of a plane-within-a-plane.  I assumed your mind formed it to protect you from the power of this place.  Rather ingenious, dear <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... I wouldn't have thought you'd had it in you.~

Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds + 10 rounds / 5 levels

Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None

Chaos Shield increases a wild mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs.   Every time a roll is made on the wild surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the dice roll.  When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with the wild mage's level bonus.~
@10612 = ~You must find a way to get inside the castle to Gromnir.  Perhaps you can reason with him... but I fear he is beyond reason.  I am afraid you will have to kill the General to give Saradush any hope of surviving the siege.~
@10613 = ~I like to know who my enemies are - could you tell me more about Yaga-Shura?~
@10614 = ~One last thing... any idea how long we have until the walls are breached?~
@10615 = ~Your own life is tied to the fate of Saradush, <CHARNAME>.  If you do not help us now, the army of Yaga-Shura will destroy everyone within this town - including you.~

@10619 = ~The smallest fraction of your soul, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... given freely, with the taint of our dead father within it.  That would recreate my flesh, restore my mortality... Sarevok would live again!~
@10620 = ~Understandably, most people will resent the presence of yet another Bhaalspawn in Saradush.  But the innkeeper at the Tankard Tree is more tolerant than most, and the Temple of Waukeen will turn no one away.~
@10621 = ~I killed you once before... what makes you think I would want to return you to life?~
@10622 = ~I do not come to the table empty-handed, <CHARNAME>.  You think me a fool?  You are stronger than me... I do not contest that.  But I can help you.  And that has its price.~
@10623 = ~Do you know how I can get inside Gromnir's castle?~
@10624 = ~No, what I offer you is knowledge that is much more relevant.  Something that dates back to my mortal days when I was gaining power within the Iron Throne.  Something that you will find... most intriguing.~
@10625 = ~Why is Yaga-Shura killing all the other Bhaalspawn?~
@10626 = ~I gathered much of the old lore when I was alive, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.  As you will recall, it was my goal to assume the mantle of our father.  I am dead, perhaps, but the lore still holds true... for you.~
@10627 = ~Bah!  Knowledge is more important than *anything*, fool.  And what I ask for is but a spark... a spark of the divine taint within you.  I will be no Bhaalspawn, my own taint long gone... but I will be alive again.~
@10628 = ~I'll need a thousand gold to share this little secret.~
@10629 = ~There's an old, abandoned jail in the city where Count Santele could imprison his political enemies. Rumor holds there was a secret passage from the jail into the castle.~
@10630 = ~Sister Farielle and I have a very *close* relationship, if you get my drift.  If you talk to her she might give you the key to the sealed door of the jail, seeing as how we're all doomed anyway.~
@10631 = ~I won't let an innocent man suffer for your actions, woman!~
@10632 = ~I am no fool.  I struggled just to get here after you destroyed me last, and I know that events move on even as we speak.  You have no time to learn these things on your own... and I will never get another opportunity such as this.~
@10633 = ~I... do not know.  Avoid crossing you, dear <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, certainly that.  My ambition was everything, once.  Now that the taint is gone, I... am unsure.  But I wish to live.~
@10634 = ~He... he's talking about *me*, isn't he?  Part of my soul will bring him back to life, too.~
@10635 = ~Figured that out all on your own, did you?  While the thought of harboring a spark of your sugary sweet soul for eternity does not exactly fill me with joy... yes, it would provide just as well.~
@10636 = ~I killed far more than he, dear Imoen, in the course of my ambition.  Ask yourself how many you have killed... or <CHARNAME>.  Are you so innocent?  Was Gorion?  I ask for no forgiveness.~
@10637 = ~Nor would you get it!  I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>.  He doesn't deserve life.  But... if it's important... I'll give up part of my soul.  You saved mine from Bodhi, you shouldn't have to sacrifice again.~
@10638 = ~So what would you have me do?~
@10639 = ~No - you must not do such a thing!  Errard is a good man:  only his intervention spared me and my son from Gromnir's wrath when he had my husband banished.~
@10640 = ~Only Errard's magic protects Saradush right now;  if the wizard is slain, the city is as good as doomed!  Oh, is there no hope?~
@10641 = ~What do you suggest I do, Countess?~
@10642 = ~It's just... just a spark, like he said.  You saved me, <CHARNAME>.  You came for me in Spellhold and you killed Bodhi.  If this needs to be done, than I want to do it.  I owe you, no matter what you say.~
@10643 = ~If... if you're certain... then alright.~
@10644 = ~Gromnir isn't much of a soldier, abandoning the city like he did.  And as a ruler, he's even more of a tyrant than Count Santele.~
@10645 = ~The townsfolk are better off since Il-Khan locked himself in that castle.  Me and my soldiers have served as the Saradush militia for years; we don't need Gromnir's help to defend the town.~
@10646 = ~Saradush would have been better off if she had never brought all those Bhaalspawn here.  Sure, she tries to help during the siege, but it's too little, too late.  The damage is already done.~
@10647 = ~Go to the Tankard Tree; the bartender there can set you up with anything you need.  Or the Temple of Waukeen, if you're the religious type.~
@10648 = ~So I have cheated death!  Thank you, dear <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... no gift could please me more.~
@10649 = ~That?  Oh... a most unpleasant matter.  A few days ago someone opened a secret gate into the town.  Saradush could easily have been overrun.   We just discovered the traitor was a young man named Mateo.~
@10650 = ~There is no way to open that entrance from the outside.  But Mateo is a faithful soldier, not the type of man to betray Saradush.~
@10651 = ~When we began our investigations, I strongly suspected Kiser.  He's a greedy, self-serving weasel who would sell his own mother if the price was right.~
@10652 = ~Well, if it isn't my dear little sister.  Tell me, little one... are you still prancing about, pretending that you are a thief?  Do you think yourself worthy of carrying Bhaal's blood in your veins?~ [SAREVO74]
@10653 = ~We didn't get a chance to complete our investigations.  Ardic, the son of the Countess Santele, disappeared.  He was our primary witness.~
@10654 = ~But somehow you still made an arrest.~
@10655 = ~No, it isn't. Ardic was taking his regular shift manning the battlements; he wouldn't be the first taken by an enemy arrow or some foul spell.  Or maybe Mateo murdered him.~
@10656 = ~That's a pretty weak case, if you ask me.~
@10657 = ~Oh?  I wouldn't know about that.  Spend your time in the Abyss, girl, dead and destroyed... and we'll see just what sorts of dreams you have then.  I'd wager you'd wilt like a flower in the heat.~
@10658 = ~But you are still convicting Mateo solely on hearsay.~
@10659 = ~If you knew the Countess, you would know her word is beyond reproach.  And she has nothing to gain from a lie:  Mateo was Ardic's closest friend.  Accusing him was very traumatic for her.~
@10660 = ~So now you just sit back and wait for the executioner?~
@10661 = ~Seems like you want to wrap this up with a quick execution.~
@10662 = ~Mind if I come to watch the traitor's execution?~
@10663 = ~Mateo will not be executed, not while we are under siege. The defense of Saradush is my first concern... but if I had more time, I would investigate further.  I just want to find the truth.~
@10664 = ~Perhaps I could delve deeper into this matter for you.~
@10665 = ~Sounds like you want someone to investigate this matter further, Captain.~
@10666 = ~If you wish to investigate further, I will not stand in your way.  Speak to Mateo in his cell.  The jailer will let you see him.~
@10667 = ~I... live!  Flesh and blood and bone!  I am alive!  Hahahahaha!  I swore I would scratch and crawl my way back into the world of the living... and I have done it!~ [SAREVO76]
@10668 = ~That's odd... I don't feel any different.~
@10669 = ~Hmph.  You'd better.  I don't... feel any differently, though.  Somehow I thought I would.~
@10670 = ~Did I not say it was only an insignificant portion?  I suspected that doing it here, in this place, it might work... but I was not sure.  It is good to see that I was correct after all.~
@10671 = ~I did not get to where I did in life without risk, fool.  It was no bluff... I knew enough to suspect that it might work, since our heritage was the same.  But none of that is important.  I imagine you are eager to hear what I have to say.~
@10672 = ~The first thing I shall tell you of is how to leave this pocket plane that you have created.  It is an extension of your will, <CHARNAME>... it exists because you need it to exist.~
@10673 = ~But I cannot give you the ability to make this plane create such a portal.  There are many barred passages in this plane of yours that I know little of.  One, however, I can open... and beyond it lies what you seek.  Watch...~
@10674 = ~Enter that room and face your challenge, <CHARNAME>.  It will be difficult... you may not want to do it alone.  There is a... spirit... here which can summon those companions you require for your party, if you require such.~
@10675 = ~My name is <GABBER>.  I think you've been framed.~
@10676 = ~I just came to see them chop off your head, traitor!~
@10677 = ~Praise Waukeen; someone who believes me!~
@10678 = ~I fear I am going crazy in this cell.  Sometimes, when it is quiet, I imagine I can hear Ardic's voice, calling as if from a great distance.~
@10679 = ~I need Ardic's testimony to prove your innocence, Mateo.~
@10680 = ~In my youth, I spent much of my time looking into the old lore of the dead Bhaal priesthood.  I unearthed one of the old prophecies from an uncooperative sect of Cyric... one that spoke extensively of this time now upon us.~ [SAREVO78]
@10681 = ~The Sword Coast will run red with blood, yes... but the battles will culminate in a great struggle within a city to the south, the Tethyrian city of Saradush.~ [SAREVO79]
@10682 = ~I know you're involved, Kiser.  I just want a piece of the action.~
@10683 = ~Your accusations are completely unfounded and without merit!  Captain Samand has found Mateo to be the sole culpable perpetrator!~
@10684 = ~No.  Bhaal's essence left me as I died... and that which has been given to me now maintains my mortality only.  Some might still consider me a Bhaalspawn, but it is solely a matter of history and memory.~
@10685 = ~Besides... you defeated me long ago.  You have earned my respect. Think of it, <CHARNAME>!  Brother and <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, side by side!~
@10686 = ~I might consider letting you join me... but you'd have to do exactly what I say.~
@10687 = ~Ah, your visage registers surprise; did you presume I did not know both your identity and ancestry long before you stumbled into my dwelling?  I present you with an offer, Bhaalspawn.~
@10688 = ~Inelegant, yet precisely accurate.  If you exterminate the enchanter Errard, I will reveal Ardic's hidden location, and I am certain his mother will reward you most handsomely upon their reunion.~
@10689 = ~Killing wizards is hard business.~
@10690 = ~I admit my culpability in Ardic's abduction, yet this does not implicate me in the betrayal of Saradush.  Ardic did indeed see me near the gates, but I was not the guilty party.~
@10691 = ~Very well, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, for now.~
@10692 = ~No one would believe my account, not without substantial proof.  Captain Samand is driven by a perverse desire to ruin me, and he was willing to convict me based on Ardic's speculative testimony.~
@10693 = ~I will take an oath to follow you, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, if that will satisfy.  Here... in this place... such an oath would have power, like a geas.  I could not betray you.~
@10694 = ~But why did you frame Mateo?~
@10695 = ~Alright.  If you swear an oath not to betray me... then you may join me.~
@10696 = ~A farfetched tale.  How do I know you are telling the truth?~
@10697 = ~If any harm befalls me, I guarantee Ardic will never be found alive.  If you desire to aid the Countess, you will help me exonerate myself.~
@10698 = ~Alas, such an elementary resolution is not possible.  While Errard lives, he is able to obfuscate investigation into his own actions.  Only his demise will allow me to clear my own name.~
@10699 = ~Regrettably, yes.  I could not attempt such an endeavor myself, but you might prevail where I would falter.  If not for me, consider how this will benefit Ardic, the Countess and even Saradush itself.~
@10700 = ~You... will not require an oath?  An... odd... choice, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.  I would have required it of you.  If I had even let you live.  As you wish, then... let us attend to your challenge.  Remember... consider that you may need more companions to complete it.~
@10701 = ~You might make the attempt, but my death will not bring gain to anyone involved.  I suggest you save your violent impulses for other individuals.  Errard comes readily to mind.~
@10702 = ~Very well.  I, Sarevok, swear on the bitter ashes of my mother and the dead god that is my father, in the name of vengeance and the bitter bile that is my blood... I swear that I shall not betray <CHARNAME> so long as I live.~
@10703 = ~Good enough.  I may return for you later, then... wait here.~
@10704 = ~As you wish.  I shall wait for your return, <CHARNAME>.  Remember... the challenge may be difficult.  Consider summoning companions to your side.~
@10705 = ~You turn your hand against me?  I should have expected as much.  I would do the same.  I know how to leave this place on my own, however... may we not meet again, dear <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~
@10706 = ~So, this is the extent of the mortality you are allowing me.  As you wish... murder me once again... if you can.~ [SAREVO88]
@10707 = ~Never mind.  Rejoin the party... my mistake.~
@10708 = ~I am already cognizant of your actions.  Errard is no more.  You will find Ardic in a secret cell within the basement; this key will grant you access.~ [SARKIS13]
@10709 = ~One of many who have given their lives defending these walls.  But there is not time to mourn.  Now please excuse me.~
@10710 = ~Impossible! Everyone knows Mateo is the traitor.  Ardic was a witness:  he caught him red-handed, or so I hear.~
@10711 = ~Brilliant.  Glad *you* came up with that idea.~
@10712 = ~Hold - my enchantment begins.~
@10713 = ~I must stay to defend the walls of Saradush against the magics of our enemy.  Find Ardic - only his testimony can save Mateo.~
@10714 = ~I appreciate what you have done to save the town from Kiser's plot, Bhaalspawn.  But I cannot speak; I must defend the walls of Saradush.~

@10720 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Melissan brought a general by the name of Gromnir Il-Khan to protect this town and its Bhaalspawn... only to have him lock himself within the castle out of paranoia.  He refuses to see anyone and is destroying Saradush with his madness.  Melissan believes he must be stopped before the besieging army can be dealt with.

I will have to find some way into the castle to deal with Gromnir.  Perhaps the meeting will be a peaceful one, although Melissan believes Gromnir must be killed.  I shall see.~
@10721 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I find myself in the city of Saradush, surrounded by the army of Yaga-Shura - a Child of Bhaal.  Within the city are a number of my own Bhaalspawn kin, led by a despot named Gromnir Il-Khan.  It seems they cannot escape from the city (even by magical means) while the army is camped outside. 
~
@10722 = ~Saradush Under Siege

I have spoken with Melissan, a woman claiming to be a friend and protector of the Children of Bhaal.  She has promised me an explanation of why Yaga-Shura wants to kill me and all the other Bhaalspawn here if I can end this siege.  
~
@10723 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Pyrgam Aleson at the Tankard Tree told me there were legends of a secret entrance into the castle through an abandoned jail.  He instructed me to talk to Sister Farielle at the Temple of Waukeen about getting into the now sealed jail.~
@10724 = ~I cannot touch your own thread, Child... nor can I tell where it leads.  I can, however, alter the threads of those whose lives are intertwined closely with your own, those whose destinies are tied to yours.~
@10725 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

Sister Farielle gave me a key to the abandoned jail.  Somewhere inside there is rumored to be a secret area which connects to the castle.  The key opens the door across the street which leads to the abandoned dungeon.  The Sister also suggested I bring some Holy Water to battle the undead I will likely encounter.~
@10726 = ~If they are meant to be part of your future, yes.  They will fall into your wake because their fates are tied to yours.~
@10727 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

Captain Samand informed me of a plot to let the enemy into Saradush through a secret gate in the wall.  On the testimony of Countess Santele the traitor, a young man named Mateo, has been taken to the Militia Headquarters.  The Captain originally suspected a vile merchant named Kiser Jhaeri, and he suggested I go speak to Mateo at the Militia Headquarters if I wish to investigate this further.~
@10728 = ~Blue Dragon Plate +2~
@10729 = ~Bring me Edwin, the conjurer mage.~
@10730 = ~As you wish.~
@10731 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

The Countess is dead, and Kiser has assured Saradush will fall by arranging the death of Errard.  He has given me a key and told me I can find Ardic in a secret cell in the basement, though with his mother dead I doubt there would be any reward if I saved the young man now.~
@10732 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

The wizard Errard told me Ardic is being held somewhere in Kiser's home.  I need to return there to find Ardic so that his testimony can free Mateo and help convict Kiser Jhaeri.~
@10733 = ~Betrayal at the Gates

Kiser Jhaeri is dead and Ardic is free.  His testimony will exonerate Mateo, and the Countess will likely give me a nice reward for my efforts.~
@10734 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

I managed to get into the castle, finally, and encountered the mad General.  Whatever chance there might have been for a peaceful resolution was dashed as soon as I met Gromnir... he was obviously as mad as Melissan claimed.  Regardless, he is dead now and his tyranny and his rampaging men will no longer be a problem for Saradush.  There is, of course, still the problem of Yaga-Shura's army around the city...~
@10735 = ~<CHARNAME>?  It... it *is* you, isn't it?  Ever since I left the circus, I wondered when I... I... that's odd.  I... don't remember when I left the circus.  What is this place?~ [AERI2531]
@10736 = ~Gromnir knows a stranger came to Saradush, pretty Melissan.  Another Bhaalspawn.  You must think Gromnir too stupid not to remember there is no way in or out of the city, mmm? Heh heh...~ [GROM07]
@10737 = ~We've traveled together before, Aerie.  It's pretty complicated... join with me and I'll explain.~
@10738 = ~Bhaalspawn mean nothing!  Yaga-Shura is Bhaalspawn - he wants Gromnir's head, too! HAH ha ha!  Foolish Melissan is plotting against Gromnir.  Melissan is plotting the ruin of all the Children of Bhaal!~ [GROM09]
@10739 = ~This is... part of the Abyss, I guess.  I summoned you here.~
@10740 = ~Join you?  I... that does sound right, somehow.  My own... abilities have grown since I last saw you.  I had to leave the circus... the Cowled Wizards were growing angry with me, at my magic.~
@10741 = ~Take Melissan away, but watch closely.  Ha ha ha!  Gromnir knows that Melissan is tricky; Melissan lies; Melissan... deceives... heh heh.~ [GROM12]
@10742 = ~So the assassin is here!  HAH!! Ha ha! Good fun!  <CHARNAME> has come to kill Gromnir, eh?~ [GROM13]
@10743 = ~I guess it didn't matter, not really.  I was helping people, when I could... but... but every time I helped someone, there was always more despair.  It... it was terrible.~
@10744 = ~So I had to leave all my friends behind.  I... I was thinking of traveling north to the mountains to search for my people.  But... but this is just as well.  I'll help you, <CHARNAME>, if you want me to.~
@10745 = ~I do... just don't get out of line, elf, and keep your whining to a minimum.~
@10746 = ~Wait here for now... I may need your help later.~
@10747 = ~Is... is that how you treat people who help you?  It... it seems so important that I help you, somehow... if it wasn't for that, I would go.  Just... just keep your rudeness to yourself, or I will!~
@10748 = ~You are mad, Gromnir!  Have I not always aided you and all the other Bhaalspawn?  I.. I brought you here to protect you - it was your paranoia that brought Yaga-Shura upon us!~ [SARMEL13]
@10749 = ~Wait... wait here?  It... it *does* seem important that I help you, somehow.  Al-alright... I'll stay here, for awhile.  But not for too long...~
@10750 = ~I'm... not too surprised.  My life has been strange since you left. Still... the Cowled Wizards are angry with me now, at my magic... I had to leave the circus.~
@10751 = ~Please, Gromnir.  <CHARNAME> just wants to talk to you.  It may be our only way to defeat Yaga-Shura.~
@10752 = ~You... summoned me?  I... haven't I been traveling with you?  No... no, I haven't, have I?  But it seems so confused...~
@10753 = ~The stranger is a friend, a Bhaalspawn, just like you.~
@10754 = ~Your madness will be your death, Gromnir, nothing else... the death of you and all those who foolishly follow you.~ [SARMEL15]
@10755 = ~Do... do you need my help, then?  I'd be glad to travel with you again.~ [AERI2530]
@10756 = ~Well... alright.  This... this is a dreadful place.  It frightens me, and... and reminds me a little of you, <CHARNAME>.  D-don't leave me here too long.~
@10757 = ~You... you want me to leave already?   I... I could still be a lot of help to you!~ [AERI2536]
@10758 = ~Do... do you need my help, then?  I'd be glad to travel with you again.~
@10759 = ~Al-alright... although I feel rather useless just... just standing around.~
@10760 = ~So our paths do cross once again.  I knew they would, even when I first laid eyes upon you.  So... what use do you have for me in this... this place?~ [ANOM2501]
@10761 = ~Gromnir!  <CHARNAME>!  Lay aside your weapons!  We must work together to...  No!  I... see I am too late to stop the bloodshed.  You have slain Gromnir and many other Bhaalspawn, as well.~ [SARMEL16]
@10762 = ~My duties with the Order are many... and my fellows have their suspicions about you, a spawn of the dead Lord of Murder.  I can see the marks that the taint has made upon your soul.~
@10763 = ~But I am not blind to the events that ravage the land.  I will join you, <CHARNAME>, to see that the right prevails.  And if you are part of these evils... then I will stop you.~
@10764 = ~Perhaps not.  It is difficult to say whether you will serve the cause of good or evil, in the end.  But, by Helm, I will watch you closely and serve in what I believe is my best judgement.~
@10765 = ~I am a high priest of Helm, and I can only serve as the Watcher wills.  I do not claim to know where your destiny lies, Bhaalspawn... take me or leave me here.~
@10766 = ~Stay here, then.~
@10767 = ~My fate has brought me here, it seems... and I will live or die according to your actions.  So be it, I am at your mercy, Bhaalspawn.~
@10768 = ~You need my help, is it?  I am no member of the Order, thanks to you... but I am still a priest of Helm, the Watcher God.  I can see the marks that your taint has made on your soul.~
@10769 = ~That does not sound as exciting, certainly... but I'll not tell you what to decide.  Do as you wish.~
@10770 = ~Forget it.  Stay here and rot... I'll decide what to do with you later.~
@10771 = ~So... do you require me to travel with you, Bhaalspawn?  Or am I to remain in this hellish place interminably?~ [ANOM2528]
@10772 = ~As you say... although I have no desire to be standing about, if there is something else to be done.~
@10773 = ~You wish to part company, my love?  I hope you are only considering a temporary parting... I would not be away from you for long.~ [ANOM2533]
@10774 = ~My mistake... stay with the party, Anomen.~
@10775 = ~Wait here... it will not be for long.~
@10776 = ~Ah.  The balance has been wildly threatened... I and others of my brethren have felt it.  And of course you are at the center of these events, Child of Bhaal.~ [CERN2501]
@10777 = ~Then wait here... I will deal with you soon.~
@10778 = ~How can it not be your goal?  You serve the balance with every breath.  Nature is as part of your soul as the taint which colors your fate... a balance in and of itself.~
@10779 = ~You may not have the most stellar of reputations, <CHARNAME>, and you may pay close heed to the call of the taint in your soul... but can even you claim that you will not serve the balance in the end?  None of us knows this for certain.~
@10780 = ~Whether one may strive for evil or good, one can never be certain that the balance is not ultimately being served.  If the balance is threatened, you may restore it no matter your intentions... or, at least, this is my hope.~
@10781 = ~Wait here?  This is an odd place, isn't it?  Unnatural and alien... yet also natural.  Alive.  I believe I will be pleased to inspect it thoroughly before you come back.~
@10782 = ~Yes... join with me, now.~
@10783 = ~Not just yet... wait here awhile longer.~
@10784 = ~That does not bother me in the slightest.  Return when you wish.  I find this strange plane of yours rather... fascinating.~
@10785 = ~As you wish.  I am sure you will proceed as you see fit... you are like a force of nature in many respects, my friend, and one that I am constantly awed to witness.~
@10786 = ~Yes... join with me again, Cernd.~
@10787 = ~Then I shall harbor my patience and endurance as do the trees.  Return when you will, my friend, and I shall endeavor to serve you then if I am able.~
@10788 = ~Oh-ho!  Have you traded in a few of your magical trinkets in exchange for a backbone?  I trust you've brought me here because you have need of my unequaled spellcasting skills, yes?~
@10789 = ~Yes, I have.  But not for your mouth... so join me and be quiet for once.~
@10790 = ~Well of course you do.  There is none better than I when it comes to the magical arts, and it is good you recognize your superiors.~
@10791 = ~Back again?  (I knew my superior skills would be needed sooner or later... they always do.)  I demand an apology for this outrage!  Forced to stand about like some hireling at your beck and call!  Such impudence!~ [EDWI2512]
@10792 = ~What?!  Aaargh!!  (I swear one day I'll turn this monkey into a... a blind vole!  Or a green slime!  Or a slug ready to be ground to a pulpy mess under my bootheel, ah yes!)~
@10793 = ~One might assume that there is some logic behind asking such a skilled wizard as I to leave... but I shall be damned if I can figure it out.~ [EDWI2514]
@10794 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait for me there.~
@10795 = ~Uhhh... okay, yeah.  Glad to have you back.~
@10796 = ~The tale begins to spin again!  Ha ha!  'Tis a marvelous life, <CHARNAME>, do not convince yourself otherwise!~
@10797 = ~If you wish, I'll sing tales of woe, instead.  Melancholy ballads will fill the halls where e'er we pass, sending bystanders into fits of despair.  Oh, and then there's the killing... you are rather fond of that, my raven, no?~
@10798 = ~Well, 'tis not quite so interesting to stand about in a miniature plane... but this sparrow is pleased enough to watch your tale from afar, for now.~
@10799 = ~Ah, my raven... I look forward to joining you in the next chapter of your great adventure!  If you'll have me, of course.~ [HAER2516]
@10800 = ~Of course... join me and let's go.~
@10801 = ~As you wish, my friend.  'Tis a quiet enough place to write my ballads, if I wish.  I'll not moon about for the lack.~
@10802 = ~Yes.  I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait for me there.~
@10803 = ~Ah, my raven... I look forward to joining you in the next chapter of your great adventure!  If you'll have me, of course.~
@10804 = ~I will... join me and let's go.~
@10805 = ~I knew that I'd see you again!  Last time we split up, I just knew that wasn't the last time!  Oh, you sure are a sight for sore eyes, let me tell you.~ [IMOE2501]
@10806 = ~Oh... I haven't been doing anything special. It's just that... some strange stuff has started happening to me.  I've been having... odd dreams.~
@10807 = ~It's not like after Irenicus had us, either.  This is different.  I... I didn't believe I was a Bhaalspawn.  Not even after Irenicus said so, not really.  But now I do.~
@10808 = ~The feelings... it's... it's hard to describe.  But you probably know all about it, huh?  I don't know how you went through it, I really don't.~
@10809 = ~Sorry.  I'll help you, if you want... I always have.  And I'll try not to get in your way.~
@10810 = ~I need you to wait here for awhile... I'll deal with you later.~
@10811 = ~Wait here?  This... this place.  It's so familiar, somehow.  It's not even scary.  I guess I can wait here, if that's what you want.~
@10812 = ~Okay.  Just... just don't leave me here, please.  I... I can feel that something is going on, something really important.  I should be a part of it.~
@10813 = ~You want me to go?  Are you sure?  Uh... part of me feels that I need to be with you, that something important is happening.  But if you're sure...~ [IMOE2528]
@10814 = ~Al-alright.  Just don't leave me here... please.  I don't think I could stand it, just standing around while everything is going on.~
@10815 = ~It is... good to see you again.  After we parted ways last, I had the strange feeling that you had... but no.  You are alive and well, I see.  Obviously I was mistaken.~ [JAHE2501]
@10816 = ~Not entirely... but it's a long story.~
@10817 = ~Things with you are always complicated.  I have heard much, as of late, of the cries against the Children... I expect things have only gotten worse with you, haven't they?~
@10818 = ~Perhaps.  Wait here for awhile... I will deal with you soon.~
@10819 = ~And I, you.  We have been apart for far too long... it does my heart good to see that you are still well, <CHARNAME>.  Will I be traveling with you, then?~
@10820 = ~Not just yet... wait here awhile.~
@10821 = ~Wait here for awhile... I will deal with you soon.~
@10822 = ~I am willing to fight at your side, <CHARNAME>.  You will need loyal companions if you are to face the time that is surely ahead... I hope it is not as dire as I fear.~
@10823 = ~This is an odd place to wait... but with you I suppose there is little that should surprise me.  Very well, I shall do as you ask.~
@10824 = ~You... wish me to leave the group?  Are you certain?  I would rather stay by your side, if at all possible.~ [JAHE2524]
@10825 = ~Just wait here... I'll be back.~
@10826 = ~Ah!  Is it time for me to rejoin you?  I hope so... I was beginning to get impatient standing about idle like this.~ [JAHE2525]
@10827 = ~Well, it's like my Uncle Spanky used to say... there's just no point in wetting your pants and screaming if you suddenly find yourself on another plane.  Especially if you're dead.  What kind of a start to the afterlife would that be?  Better to just look like you know what you're doing and impress the hell out of everyone.  Of course, Uncle Spanky didn't often follow his own advice.  He was once laughed off of Mount Celestial by a pair of mischievous planetars, I hear. (Bastards!)~
@10828 = ~Oh, is this how it's going to be?  Insult the poor gnome and then tell him to get in the party?  Hmph.  Like I haven't anything better to do.  Well, okay, so maybe I haven't.  Turnip market's gone all to heck... might as well hook up with you again.~
@10829 = ~Time for a little adventure, is it?  I figured as much.  I saw some ogres down in Amn capture a poor Bhaalspawn... a kobold, that one, my but that Bhaal got around, didn't he?  Anyway, they were stewing him in a big iron pot and I thought to myself, "Jan, my boy, that's adventure you're smelling."~
@10830 = ~I'm sending you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~
@10831 = ~(snore) ... Uh, huh, what?!  Is it time to go already?~ [JANJ2524]
@10832 = ~I can use your help... if you can control your judgmental side.~
@10833 = ~You talk like I had a choice.  The fool was too far gone.~
@10834 = ~Mass Raise Dead 
(Necromancy) 
Level: Quest
Sphere: Necromantic 
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent 
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Up to 5 party members 
Saving Throw: Special 

A more powerful version of Raise Dead, this spell brings up to 5 party members back to life and heals 3D10+1 per level of the caster points of damage. They can regain the rest of their hit points by natural healing or curative magic. This spell restores life to all possible races of party members.~
@10835 = ~I'll send you to the pocket plane... wait there for me.~
@10836 = ~Aye, I shall do as you ask.  Stay safe, my friend... and do not be gone too long.~
@10837 = ~I'll tell you what I want and you'll do as I say... or you'll be stuck here.~
@10838 = ~You... can leave Saradush?  Yes, of course... you found your way into the city, it is only logical to expect you can find your way out.  Why didn't I think of that earlier?~
@10839 = ~Me temper shall go where it pleases... and me axe will bloody well follow.  If ye want me axe put anywhere but in yer skull, groundling, ye'll keep out of me way.  Got it?~
@10840 = ~Oh?  Needs me axe, does ye?  Fair enough.  So long as there's ample reward behind yer silver tongue.  Ye does a fair amount o' killing, anyway, as I recall... enough t' catch me fancy, if ye knows what I mean.  Har har!~
@10841 = ~You tread a thin line.  I dislike being manipulated... by anyone.~
@10842 = ~I see... you tell me nothing, and force me into helping you regardless of my own desires.~
@10843 = ~It is not my first choice to do this, <CHARNAME>.  However, in my dealings with the Children of Bhaal I have learned that... sometimes... the ends must justify the means.~
@10844 = ~Aye?  Does ye wish me to wait about?  I can do it... though I hates to be left out of a bloody good fight.~ [KORG2522]
@10845 = ~The army itself is immaterial.  If you fought your way to Yaga-Shura, himself, and defeated him, the force would collapse.  But that's... not a simple matter.  He is a powerful fire giant, to begin with...~
@10846 = ~A giant?  Well, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?~
@10847 = ~Is it any more an abomination than a Bhaalspawn <PRO_RACE>?  Bhaal was a god of pure evil - his taint is an abomination in any form.~
@10848 = ~This... this is a strange place that you've brought me to, my friend.  I have little doubt that it's for a good reason.  Do you require my assistance, or is there some other purpose to your summoning?~ [MAZZ2501]
@10849 = ~Everything is as well as can be expected, <CHARNAME>.  I still miss my poor Patrick greatly... but I am sure you did not bring me here for a mere social call.  What is it you wish?~
@10850 = ~Are you saying Yaga-Shura is invincible?~
@10851 = ~I will send you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~
@10852 = ~Fine.  I will accept your mission and find a way to destroy the "invincible" Yaga-Shura.~
@10853 = ~I'll kill Yaga-Shura.  But once the deed is done I better get something in return!~
@10854 = ~Saradush Under Siege

With Gromnir dead, Melissan feels there is but one hope to save Saradush:  slay Yaga-Shura, fire giant leader of the army besieging the city.  Melissan believes the death of their leader will demoralize the army, and they will give up their attempts to breach the defenses of Saradush. I can use my pocket plane special ability to get out of the city.~
@10855 = ~Alright... wait here awhile and I'll deal with you later.~
@10856 = ~Minsc at Boo stand at the ready... heeya!~ [MINS2517]
@10857 = ~I'll send you back to the pocket plane... wait there.~
@10858 = ~I see we meet again.  I had foreseen that such an event would take place... I should have known that it would be soon, with the Bhaalspawn incidents increasing so rapidly.~ [NALI2501]
@10859 = ~Nalia?  You seem... different.~
@10860 = ~I am not the frightened girl you remember meeting.  Or do you?  I perceive that I have not been transported here so much as my history has been slightly altered... including my own experience of it.~
@10861 = ~As for myself, yes... I am changed.  In the short time since I knew you, I have become an archmage with real power.  It is those talents you need, is it not?  I presume that is why I am here.~
@10862 = ~I am a bit... wary... of involving myself in your struggle, <CHARNAME>.  To try and avoid it is to fight fate, however.  I suppose I can only hope that good comes of it in the end.~
@10863 = ~I hope you did not arrange for me to be here just to leave me on this plane.  Or something worse.  Very well... I will wait.~
@10864 = ~It's... good to see you, too, <CHARNAME>.  I must admit, I've thought about you since we last met. I would like to travel with you again.~
@10865 = ~Good... let's go, then.~
@10866 = ~Hurry up and wait, eh?  I'm a patient man... I can wait awhile, if that's what you want.~
@10867 = ~Are... are you sure you want to part ways?  I'd hate it if anything happened to you and I wasn't there.~
@10868 = ~My help?  Ah, it must be because the drow are so renowned for their sense of nobility.  So be it, <CHARNAME>.  I am willing to join with you again... for now.~
@10869 = ~Wait here awhile, then... I will deal with you later.~
@10870 = ~Your sarcasm is not lost on me, dalhar.  Tell me, then... why summon me at all?  Perhaps you have found some use for me that I am unaware of?~
@10871 = ~I enjoy one who is assertive, but do not cross the line, wael. I shall enjoy watching the full power of your godsblood... but tempt me not. I will join.~
@10872 = ~You bring me only to wait about?  No doubt that you plan treachery.  So be it... it shall be met in kind, if that is what you aim for.~
@10873 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

Melissan has warned me that the fire giant Bhaal spawn is immune to all weapons and magic.  Unless I can find some way to overcome his resistances any attempt to destroy him is doomed to failure.  

Perhaps the secret to defeating him can be found in a swamp deep within the Forest of Mir, where Yaga-Shura was raised.  It is also possible that a cult of fire giants in the Marching Mountains knows a way to nullify Yaga-Shura's power.~
@10874 = ~I'm surprised to see others in the glade, never mind soldiers.  I was nervous to head this way, myself, considering the glade's history and everything... but I thought at the very least trouble would steer clear of it.~
@10875 = ~Yes... yes, of course!  I am Karthis al-Hezzar, a simple merchant.  I... I normally take the road through Saradush, but I understand it's been closed with all the trouble there.~
@10876 = ~All of his clerics and assassins are supposed to have died horribly, and so they haunt the glade and Bhaal's old temple.  Spirits and other things seem... drawn there, as well.~
@10877 = ~Uh... is there anything else I can help you with?~
@10878 = ~How did I come to this?  I'm just a simple farmer!  Is it my fault my father was the Lord of Murder?~
@10879 = ~I'm not trying to find a way out, I'm trying to get in to see Gromnir.~
@10880 = ~How ironic:  you are trying to get out, and I want to get in and see Gromnir.~
@10881 = ~I've survived... that's all.  And without your help, old man.~
@10882 = ~Most of the Bhaalspawn just go along with his wild accusations, trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves.  But I can't stand it anymore.~
@10883 = ~Now I understand why you're trying to escape this place.~
@10884 = ~Gromnir has to keep you Bhaalspawn in line.  Sounds like you just lack the stomach for leadership.~
@10885 = ~Yes, you survive... at the cost of everything you were meant to be.  I am dead for all the sacrifices I made for you, and you *will* be made to see the truth of it!~
@10886 = ~The curse of my Bhaal-tainted blood.   Whenever I was afraid, I would suddenly be teleported to a completely new part of the world.  Most disruptive, especially while I was being hunted.~
@10887 = ~And Imoen... my second hope.  You have turned her into a conspirator to your own failure.  All her potential... lost.  How both of you disgust me so.~
@10888 = ~Are you another of Gromnir's Bhaalspawn followers?~
@10889 = ~By other Bhaalspawn, of course.  Yaga-Shura, for one.  Others.  Whenever I tried to build a life, the hunters would show up and poof - I'd jump.  Or teleport, if you rather.  It's not a very comfortable thing to live with.~
@10890 = ~Then you know nothing of yourself!  You have learned nothing!  You grow ever closer to being a slave of your blood... you will murder all that you love and die a monster!~
@10891 = ~No?  You *will* be judged, <CHARNAME>.  You have learned nothing of yourself.  You will murder all that you love and you will die a monstrous slave to your blood... and I will not allow it!~
@10892 = ~How many more must come to grief before you see I am correct?  How many must die?  What of your many former companions... how many are dead, now, because of you?~ [HGWRA107]
@10893 = ~Fascinating tale.  I'll be going now.~
@10894 = ~Melissan was only trying to help me.  She had the best of intentions, though obviously events have not worked out as we all hoped.~
@10895 = ~I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me, but I should be going now.~
@10896 = ~What is so inevitable?!  <CHARNAME> has fought the greatest foes... there is nothing that could come between us!~
@10897 = ~Intruders in the Sacred Temple!  The fire of our master can never be extinguished!~

@10912 = ~I should cut your tongue out for your impertinence... but since I have no weapon, and since you did save my life...~
@10913 = ~My name is Ehlastra, a warrior from the Northern lands.  I had heard legends of Yaga-Shura, a Child of Bhaal born unto a giantess.  I came to this place to see if the legends were true.~

@10918 = ~I wanted to become part of his unstoppable war machine, to revel in the slaughter, to have my blade drip with the blood of all those Yaga-Shura crushed beneath his mighty boot!~

@10920 = ~The fire giants in this Temple are short sighted fools.  They recognized my warrior skills, but saw me only as a potential mate for Yaga-Shura, a chance for him to further spread Bhaal's seed.~

@10928 = ~You knew!  I loved you... you were the center of my world, dalninil.  Like no drow, I cared for you.  And... you used me to get away.  I became a drider, Viconia!  You murdered me!~ [3LOVE10]

@10943 = ~Hahahahahahaha... Nyalee knows many tricks, she does!  Tricks that she taught to the boy, Yaga-Shura!  Why you think she lives so long?~ [HGNYA07]
@10944 = ~Hahahaha!  You have come!  Come, you have!  The powerful one who is the spawn of the dead master!  Hahaha!  Nyalee knew you would come, she did!~ [HGNYA09]
@10945 = ~Why, the Nyalee is I!  The Witch of the Glade, I is called, and for good reason, it is!  But questions... you have so many questions, know I!~
@10946 = ~It is the boy... that traitorous fool of a half-giant boy of mine.  You come because of Yaga-Shura!  My boy has been a pain for you and I both, and you wish his blood, yes?~
@10947 = ~Only Nyalee knows the words and the arts to extinguish the boy's heart, she does.  But Nyalee needs her own heart to use the arts... and the boy stole her heart years ago.  Keeps it, he does.~
@10948 = ~Finds Nyalee's heart and Yaga-Shura's heart both, spawn-child... brings them both to her.  Nyalee will quench his heart forever, then!  Hee hee!  So surprised, so shocked will he be!~
@10949 = ~I may have the hearts you speak of... are these them?~
@10950 = ~The boy has collected followers... live with them in the fire-mountains, he will.  Nyalee knows not where.  He will keeps her poor heart there, in hiding.  His, as well, Nyalee is sure!~
@10951 = ~Yes!  Hee hee!  Nyalee will haves her revenge, oh yes!  Go, spawn-child... go and finds Nyalee's poor heart!  Bring me the boy's, as well!  Nyalee cannot wait!~
@10952 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

I have encountered a witch by the name of Nyalee within the ruins of a Bhaal temple in the Haunted Glade.  Nyalee raised Yaga-Shura and taught him to remove his heart and keep it ablaze as the secret to his invulnerability.  His heart must be extinguished in order to remove his power.  Nyalee will do it, but she needs me to bring her his heart... as well as her own, which Yaga-Shura has stolen.~
@10953 = ~Defeating Yaga-Shura

I encountered a woman kept slave in Yaga-Shura's quarters who gave me some information.  Apparently, the giant is obsessed with a small, golden chest that he keeps hidden within his stony bed.  As well, she mentioned a crone by the name of Nyalee who knows something of Yaga-Shura's secrets... and that Nyalee can be found in the Forest of Mir.~
@10954 = ~If I had my armor and weapons you would be dead now, scum!  But only a fool engages in battle they cannot win; the wise warrior flees to fight another day!~
@10955 = ~Oh!  'Tis Nyalee's heart, it is!  The spawn-child has found Nyalee's poor heart!  And, yes... this be the boy's heart, as well.  Gives Nyalee her heart and she will extinguish the boy's, she will, oh yes!~
@10956 = ~You... you is a spawn-child, Nyalee thinks, oh yes.  But so young!  So young is you!  So full of life!  Hmph... Nyalee would love to have finds you long ago instead of the boy.~ [HGNYA11]
@10957 = ~Umm... not to be rude or anything, but I'm rather glad you didn't...~
@10958 = ~Soooo... changes your mind, haves you?  Knowing, perhaps, that only Nyalee can helps you, yes?~
@10959 = ~I may have the hearts you spoke of... are these them?~
@10960 = ~I may have... I have two hearts, here.  Are they what you need?~
@10961 = ~Yes... yes, at last Nyalee has her heart.  Nyalee had forgotten how it feels to have a heart, she had.  Many old memories.  It makes Nyalee sad.~ [HGNYA08]
@10962 = ~And... there.  It be done, a simple thing, it is.  The boy's heart is cold, now.  As... as cold as his mother's old heart...~
@10963 = ~You... you will hurts my boy, won't you?  No... no, what has Nyalee done?!  My poor boy, the spawn-child will hurts him!  Nyalee must stops <PRO_HIMHER>!!~
@10964 = ~Come, spirits of the glade!  Come, woodsies of the forest!!  We... we must protects my boy!  My precious Yaga-Shura!!~
@10965 = ~Many of the words on these scattered pages have faded over the centuries.

..power of my electrical enchantments... our caged pet... the form of a green slime giant is vulnerable to lightning...

Only the final entry has survived in its entirety:

I finally have a plan to be rid of that sorry, slime loving excuse for a mage.  If I turn my fan to its highest setting while the south-west door to his noxious laboratory is open the poison mist will be blown clear, making his noxious pets vulnerable!  

I must remember to use my lightning on that ooze puddle, unless I want thousands of those things crawling around the dungeon.

Soon I will put my plan into action, and be rid of his caustic presence forever! 
~
@10966 = ~The ink of this diary has run, oozing across the pages and smearing many of the words:

... forces we do not comprehend ... concentrate on my own research...    acid and poison are potent against its air incarnation...

The final words of the last page are the most legible:

... devised a way to be rid of the cold hearted monster.  If I set the air mage's fan on high and open all the doors between the fan room, my own lab and the ice wizard's frigid chamber, the drafts will blow my toxic vapors down the hall towards the frost wizard's minions.  Once touched by the poison gas they will become tainted and vulnerable.  That snowblind fool won't know what hit him!    

I can then close the doors or turn the fan back to the low setting, and the gas will drift back into my noxious lab to preserve my own precious pets.~

@10977 = ~Welcome to Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, the expansion pack to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and the completion of the Child of Bhaal storyline.

Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal is split into two sections: 

1) An Add-In Section - a grand new adventure takes place at the Watcher's Keep, a new area on your map in BGII. The Keep can be played during the course of BGII. It can also be played after BGII in the Add-On section. Play the Add-In Section simply by loading a BGII save and going to the Watcher's Keep. 
2) An Add-On Section - This continues the main storyline of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Play the Add-On Section by finishing Baldur's Gate II:Shadows of Amn or by importing your character or party into Throne of Bhaal (see below.) The Watcher's Keep can also be accessed from the Add-On Section. Once you have started the Add-On section, you can no longer return to Shadows of Amn or its areas.

Clicking the New Game button will take you to the character creation screen where you can create a character to begin Throne of Bhaal at its beginning, shortly after the events chronicled in Shadows of Amn. You have the option of creating a brand new character, who will be outfitted with two million experience points and a variety of powerful weapons and items. You also have the option of importing a character from a saved game or from the character folder. These characters will also be given items and set to two million experience points, if they haven't already reached this level of experience.

Clicking the Import Game button will allow you to import your party from a BGII saved game, such as your final save from Shadows of Amn. This is also an option from which you can load your Throne of Bhaal saves once you've started the mission pack and saved a game.

Click Cancel to return to the previous menu. 

Please enjoy Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal.~

The Lord was burned at the stake and the legends say that his heart would not burn. The Heart is an artifact of significant malevolent power and may be of some use.

@11239 = ~You haves stuff for old druid recipe.  Good recipe, too.  Heartwood Ring... needs 5,000 gp, Oaken Ring and a Nymph's Tear.  You gots all that... wants me to make?~
@11240 = ~Well, I don't sees anything else I can makes.  So much for that, over and out, see ya... wouldn't wanna be ya and all that.  Uh, Cespenar going, now... I wants a nap, maybe.~ [BOTSM87]

@11246 = ~It... it is to be expected, I suppose.  Many say that Balthazar is one of the terrible spawn of the dead god, Bhaal.  He prepares for war, no doubt, and we simply pray that this war does not come to Amkethran.

@11247 = ~Melissan is a protector of all of Bhaal's children, it is said, just as Elminster protects those who harp.  Why such a mage would protect godspawn who only bring terror and destruction I do not know... nor does anyone.~

@11249 = ~I have heard tales of great wars and destruction in the lands beyond the desert, and while the order has never involved itself in such things before, it seems Balthazar has changed things.  He plans a war... a great and terrible war... but I do not know against whom.~

@11251 = ~Hmph.  Zakee's prices are outrageous!  I suppose there's not much supply right now... but why should the tavern get everything?~

@11253 = ~I heard Athkatla was sacked within the last month by the Sythillisians.  And then the great ogre, himself, was revealed as a Bhaalspawn and killed by some fire giant.  Incredible story, I think.~
@11254 = ~The Rune is getting impatient.  Balthazar claims we will be fighting an army of dragons soon, but refuses to send us out or tell us when the battle will begin.  And he seems to despise working with us... why he would even bother is beyond me.~

@11264 = ~The journal is thick and filled out with various entries that are, at first, legible elvish... relating the writer's horror at being trapped in the maze, his frustration at the fact that even retracing your steps through a portal you have just traveled through will not lead you back to the area you just came from.  The writer is obviously morose and guilty over abandoning his dead comrades, and his writing suffers over time... slowly degenerating into mad scribbles, paranoid ramblings about demons and wild, repeated references to 'Yakman' written all over the journal.

Only once does the mad scripture give way to a clear section, some form of poetry which may be some manner of directions... or may be nothing more than drivel.

"I stand in the room that shows the way,
 and I must get out of here.
 I flee towards the rising sun,
 to find the pillar of stone is near."

"I continue from there as I began,
 and with the demon speak.
 He bids me south to journey onward,
 to run and not be weak."

"South until the obelisk I find,
 with runes on every face.
 The setting sun draws me on, then,
 into its fiery red embrace."

"From there I flee to the coldest north,
 and lay down by the tree.
 But even there the north still calls,
 as to the north I'm free."~
@11265 = ~The booklet is an extremely old and tattered journal of an adventurer by the name of Sir Kalthorine ut Wistan.  The pages are yellowed with age and have been damaged by taloned feet walking over them... but various pieces are still readable.  Sir Kalthorine comments more specifically on the dangers of finding his way past the demons and devils of this level of the keep, noting especially the 'dead magic zones' in the blue rooms and the 'wild magic zones' in the red rooms and that he had mostly reassembled the needed 'Scepter of Radiance'.

One comment Sir Kalthorine makes is on the portals, themselves: he thought the fact that you could re-enter a portal you had just emerged from and not come out in the room it led from to be interesting... and considered the possibility that such a fact might be important in finding one's way through the maze.

Beyond this, the only lengthy part seems to be Sir Kalthorine's utter disgust at the 'betrayal' of the Knights of the Vigil for his predicament.  Nothing more detailed can be found about this, and it seems especially odd as the journal appears to be perhaps half a century old or more.~

@11314 = ~Hah!  You are a fool to think the Five are defeated, now.  Of all of Bhaal's children, who do you think possessed the most of his essence?  You, certainly... but we Five, as well.~ [2YAGA21]
@11315 = ~How many of the Five have you killed?  Myself?  Illasera?  Probably Abazigal and Sendai, too?  That is a lot of Bhaal's essence... and still one Bhaalspawn remaining.~ [2YAGA22]

@11326 = ~It was I who created the Five... loosed the god-spawn at each other's throats all the while promising those fools that they would serve at Bhaal's right hand.  Well they can... in Limbo, for all I care.~ [MELISS15]
@11327 = ~No, that's true.  I knew that Illasera would perish against your might... but I did not expect you to show up quite so soon.  Still, you proved a fortunate arrival.~ [MELISS17]
@11328 = ~Getting rid of one of the Five without it looking like my doing was one thing... but with you already in Saradush, I could turn you on Yaga-Shura as well.  After I let him into Saradush to kill the other Bhaalspawn, of course.~ [MELISS18]
@11329 = ~And then you turned on the rest of those paranoid fools while I distracted them.  The Five were the last thing I had to deal with before I could become the Lady of Murder, myself... and you've dealt with them nicely.~ [MELISS19]

@11332 = ~I'd confront your kind of evil wherever I had to go... and I will win.~
@11333 = ~Your course is set, god-child.  Return to your pocket plane... and when you are ready, you will need to end its existence.  Then you will be within the Throne of Blood... and Melissan will be at hand.~ [SOLAR72]
@11334 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I'm here to destroy you!~
@11335 = ~I... I can help you.  Help you to defeat Abazigal.  I know the secrets of this place.  I feared my knowledge would die with me, but now I can pass it on to you!~
@11336 = ~I will... give you... the wardstone... to pass.  You can... kill... Abazigal!~
@11337 = ~I am the child of a god!  Did you really think your pathetic army could stop me?~
@11338 = ~No, in truth I had other plans for my army.  But since you killed Abazigal and Sendai, I have no further need of these mercenaries who so drain the monastery's treasury.~
@11339 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

Both Sendai and Abazigal are dead, but I have been shown a disturbing vision:  Balthazar and Melissan locked in fierce combat.  The disappearance of Lady Melissan is suddenly not so strange, and I cannot help but wonder at the depths of Balthazar's involvement with the Five.
To find answers I must somehow find a way into the monastery and confront Balthazar... though I suspect one of us will not survive the encounter.

@11340 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

My old friend Saemon has shown up yet again, warning me that Balthazar's army of mercenaries is waiting for me should I enter the town.  The deceitful pirate promised to get me inside, but I spurned his offer.  I have been betrayed by Saemon one too many times to trust him again.~

@11344 = ~Assault on the Enclaves

Balthazar revealed himself as a Bhaalspawn, and one of the Five - though he never shared their goal of resurrecting Bhaal.  The mad monk wanted to wipe the taint of Bhaal from the world by killing all of Bhaal's children, including himself.
More disturbing were the implications he leveled at the still-absent Melissan.  If his words are true, she has been manipulating me the entire time for her own nefarious purposes.~
@11345 = ~I know it's hard when you learn your father was a god of pure evil.  You just have to find a way to deal with it... I did.  Eventually.~
@11346 = ~That reminds me of my great uncle Hegemony... not that he was much of an uncle, you understand.  Always in dispute with the local lord over his rights to the surrounding farmlands.  The duke had him thrown in prison for a year and a day before the duke's mother revealed Hegemony was actually a distant relation of the royal family - something about a drunken tryst between the duke's grandfather's brothers and a comely gnomish lass... details are sketchy.~
@11347 = ~Not really. The duke didn't want Hegemony making any claims against his throne (or whatever those fancy muck-a-mucks sit on), so he banished Hegemony's family and sent my uncle himself to the guillotine.  After the execution, they returned the body to his family, but nobody could remember where they had stashed his upper portions.  All worked out in the end, though... Hegemony's family couldn't afford a full length coffin, anyway.~
@11348 = ~I was just struck by the coincidence, is all.  The royal blood running through great uncle Hegemony's veins was as thin as your own Bhaalspawn essence, friend... and in the end it kept his family from getting ahead.  
Huh... you look a little pale there.  Why don't you just forget I ever brought it up.~
@11349 = ~By your sniveling manners I would say Bhaal's blood runs very thin indeed in your veins.  Bah - why do I even waste my breath tormenting this cowering cur?~

@11353 = ~How amusing you surface dwellers can be.  Instead of reveling in the pleasures of the flesh, you insist on shaming yourselves into guilt over your dalliances.  Foolish rivvin!~
@11354 = ~Then my sisters and I shall leave you to your misery, mortal one.  Come, alou fiends... perhaps there is a hapless baatezu about that we can torment.~

@11361 = ~You should have remained true to Bhaal... only he could have saved you, now!~
@11362 = ~But it doesn't matter, in the long run.  You've served me well enough... and now it is time for your essence to be added back to my power.~
@11363 = ~I should not be wasting time on you.  I still have to absorb the Bhaalspawn essences... and there is more than enough power in this plane to keep you busy.~ [FINMEL25]

@11380 = ~Well, you know, it's funny that this situation should come up.  It's not something that I like to think about much, but I spent a whole year as a god back in '03.  Oh, I know what you're thinking... why only a year?  It's a touching and involved tale, but I'm happy to shed some light on it if it helps with your predicament.~ [JANJ2521]
@11381 = ~It's nice to hear you eager, for once.  It's not every day that a gnome finds himself in the middle of the Abyss fighting an avatar and talking to a solar, you know.  I haven't done that for at least a year, now... although to be honest, the last time was only in the company of Aunt Patty and we all know what a pushover her Larry was... and it's nice to see that my tribulations in this party are recognized.~
@11382 = ~Being a god isn't what you'd expect, though.  Sune was all over me from day one... I hear she developed a thing for turnips about a decade ago.  She just wouldn't leave me alone!  There were parties at all hours of the night, Lliira would get plastered and fall into the lily pond and eventually Torm would start a brawl with somebody.  Did you know what it's like to have Helm pounding on your door at three in the morning?  I could never get any sleep at all.  If it wasn't one thing it was getting slapped by Umberlee or hit on by Loviatar.  All night long... and in the morning, all the gods would be in a foul mood.  Terrible.~
@11383 = ~I couldn't find anything good about the experience at all.  No wonder Ao kicked them all out.  He probably had to catch up on his housekeeping, of all things.  Well, after all of that I was more than happy to let Cyric have the job, eager puppy that he was.  Left it behind me for a turnip farm and a nice pension, and gladly... although I eventually traded the pension for some stock in a Spelljammer trading cruiser, which was a bad decision but all us mortals aren't immune to that, of course.  Lost the farm, too, in a game of checkers to Uncle Fibbert.  But that turned out all right, as the turnips got a bad rot that year and Uncle Fibbert died of too much intestinal gas.  Poor man.~

@11441 = ~I was just thinking how much you remind me of my cousin Gabber.   Ironic name his parents gave him, since he never said a word till the day he died.  Caught a case of the Tethyr Tongue Gout from eating an unwashed turnip when he was but a babe.  Poor little Gabber's tongue shriveled up like an honest Amnian merchant's purse.  Turned him into the strong, silent type... kind of like you, Valygar.~ [JANJ2518]
@11442 = ~Aerie!  Boo has been mulling over a question for you.  Never have I seen a hamster concentrate so!  He has been so very quiet I thought perhaps I rolled over on him last night, which caused me great concern.~ [MINS2506]
@11443 = ~You are just... oh!~
@11444 = ~But Boo's question is of such a personal nature... well, the thought of it makes me blush right down to my buttocks.~
@11445 = ~I... see.  Perhaps Boo should ask me anyway to get it off his chest.  We... wouldn't want a hamster to bottle up all that anxiety, now, would we?~
@11446 = ~You are very insightful!  Such bottling could lead to all sorts of un-hamster-like explosions!  Well... Boo wonders why you do not perform all your duties, since you are our witch?~
@11447 = ~Well... a Rashemeni witch accompanies a ranger on his dajemma and teaches him the lore of herbs, among other things.  Well... Minsc and Boo have discovered a need of some of this lore, maybe.~
@11448 = ~My duties?  I thought you were supposed to protect me... I didn't know there were any duties involved.  And what's so personal about this?~
@11449 = ~I... I... ah, I'll do what I can, Minsc.~
@11450 = ~My stories aren't pointless!  Now where was I?  Oh, that's right. Gabber.  His tongue was nothing but a long, skinny piece of flesh by the time the disease was done with it.  But Gabber was determined to learn to talk.  He did tongue exercises and tongue stretches everyday, and his tongue kept getting longer and more nimble the more he worked with it.  They say he was able to pick locks with his unusual appendage, though I never had the privilege of witnessing that feat myself.  By the time he was a young man he could flick that thing out a full two feet in front of his face and make the tip twirl like a Calim veil dancer.~
@11451 = ~Too bad he came to such a tragic ending.  Gabber wasn't much of a looker, you know, and he couldn't say a word with that freakishly long tongue of his.  But for some inexplicable reason the ladies loved him.  In the end, that was what did him in.  Nomis Stormfingers, an extremely large and jealous village smith, found my unfortunate cousin in a compromising position with Mrs. Stormfingers.  Nomis reached inside Gabber's mouth, yanked that long lingua out, looped it around his throat and strangled him with it. Lynched him with his own tongue, if you can believe it.~
@11452 = ~Nalia, I've noticed that you've been very quiet as of late.  Grim, even.  Is... something wrong?~ [AERI2515]
@11453 = ~Well, no... it's just that you used to be friendlier.~
@11454 = ~Haer'Dalis... you've been staring at our leader with that look off and on for several hours, now.  Don't you think that's a little rude?~ [AERI2516]
@11455 = ~Of course not!  That's why you remind me so much of Gabber:  you're both tongue tied.~

@11459 = ~There was no heroism, Anomen, only slow brutal death and grim deeds. We shall speak no more of this.~
@11460 = ~Er...~

@11463 = ~Ha ha!  If I didn't know you better, Valygar, I think I'd have to take that the wrong way! Heh...~ [AERI2529]
@11464 = ~Indeed! All know that you're an unrepentant ass. 'Tis not my place to bring it up.~
@11465 = ~I... didn't mean to joke about that.  I know about your past... and I don't think I could ever be like that.  Magic is a power I can use to help people, and that's all.~
@11466 = ~Arrogant, drunken, piggish, whiny, pompous are common adjectives used to describe you, but I was wrong to say so. You are completely incapable of independent thought and soil yourself with regularity seldom found outside of the nursery. I shall no longer bring these things up in front of others.~
@11467 = ~I care nothing for what you will have, fool, no matter how you gild your words. Be thankful for my scrutiny. Very few rivals outside the Red Wizards are worthy of it.~ [EDWI2506]
@11468 = ~It might benefit your heart and soul to speak of your troubles, my friend.~
@11469 = ~'Tis exactly that subject I wish to discuss. Now, it's common knowledge that knights are cleric initiates who are too stupid and ugly to be presentable in church.~
@11470 = ~Of course you didn't 'fail'! They have to tell the failures something to keep up blind obedience, that is to say, morale.~
@11471 = ~As you wish, Valygar. I shall bother you no more, though I shall say a prayer to Helm that he may help you with your burden.~
@11472 = ~No, 'twas the fish heads that earned him that moniker. Real name is Rooctal or Slooble or something. I can't recall. Why, as Pappy used to say, 'If you can't join 'em, take your boot and --~
@11473 = ~Well you did walk into that one. You should have ignored him.~
@11474 = ~No... no, it's alright, Anomen.  I probably should face up to the fact that I will have to return to Faenya-Dale one day.  To face them, if nothing else.  But certainly not now.~
@11475 = ~That is cruel of you, Anomen.  If I return to Faenya-Dale one day, it will be because I am ready to... not because someone felt it necessary to bully me into it.~
@11476 = ~... which is really the reason I had the donkey to begin with. Good luck with the rash!~
@11477 = ~So, Anomen, Boo and I had a question about the lodge you seem to hold above all else.~ [MINS2507]
@11478 = ~Perhaps.  I do not know what destiny awaits you, I have seen how power can destroy those who lust after it.~
@11479 = ~So... Sarevok.  You've had an itty-bitty piece of my soul in there for quite a while, now.  What's it been like?~ [IMOE2502]
@11480 = ~(sigh)  Well, other than a slight obsession with my weight and the resurgence of a few pimples, it's been simply grand.  Now leave me be, girl.~ [SAREVO64]
@11481 = ~Valygar, I have no wish to offend you, but I can remain silent no longer.  You are a great warrior and a true defender of what is moral and right...~ [KELD2504]
@11482 = ~There's something evil growing within you.  The part of me that is devoted to Baervan reels from it... even though I know that it has nothing to do with the person you are, that it's separate.~
@11483 = ~Keldorn, do not waste your breath trying to convert this heathen.  I respect what you stand for, but I have no need of a god to serve... even one as worthy as Helm.~
@11484 = ~I will take your words as a compliment, Keldorn... and not as a high handed condemnation of my own beliefs.  If you find comfort believing I unwittingly serve Helm, I shall not object.~
@11485 = ~I have a question for you, my friend... and it is something I wish you would treat with the sincerity in which it is meant.  Do you believe that your ultimate destiny lies in godhood?~ [ANOM2514]
@11486 = ~It appears your destiny may be far greater then perhaps even you at first suspected.  Great power awaits you, and I cannot help but remember that you carry the blood of Bhaal within your veins.~
@11487 = ~I fear for you, <CHARNAME>... and I fear you as well.  I will stand by your side as long as you walk in the light of truth and justice.  And I will help you resist the evil within yourself.~
@11488 = ~I will say a prayer for you, <CHARNAME>, and ask Helm to guide our steps down the path of your destiny.~
@11489 = ~Nothing to add?~
@11490 = ~You look a little down, Edwin. You're not upset, are you?~ [IMOE2505]
@11491 = ~WHA! What... is it... NOW!~
@11492 = ~Now that was just... you are just being...~
@11493 = ~(grumble) ... whelp... child... monkey-brained... how would you like your flaming death you... grrrr...~
@11494 = ~A moment, Imoen, if you don't mind.~ [JAHE2512]
@11495 = ~Ah, finally someone who appreciates my tales!  A story about dwarves, eh?  Let me see... of course:  my cousin Kimble.  Not himself a dwarf, per say, but Kimble always was of peculiar tastes for a gnome.  He fell in love with a dwarven lass.  She was stout and stocky, with a gruff voice and a soft, supple, full beard...~ [JANJ2515]
@11496 = ~Ah, gnome, ye know how to paint a lovely picture... such a beauty she must ha' been!~
@11497 = ~Oh yes, she was a fine looking woman... to Kimble's eyes, at least.  She cast a spell on him far stronger than any sorcerer ever could.  But she wouldn't have anything to do with my cousin - she had dwarven princes and clan lords after her calloused hand, and she couldn't be bothered with a dirt-poor turnip-farming gnome.  But Kimble's heart wouldn't be denied... he left his own family to follow this bewitching creature back to her clan home.~
@11498 = ~Yer losin' me, gnome... I don't want some weepy love story.  I want killin' and death!  Give me blood!~
@11499 = ~You wanted a story about dwarves, and this is the only one I've got.  I can't just make up a lie, you know... that would be an affront to the grand tradition of storytelling in my family!  Now, where was I?  Oh yes, Kimble.  My cousin followed the lovely dwarven lass to her clan home in the Alimir Mountains, and started a turnip farm there.  He had a rough go of it at first, let me tell you... taxes, levies, zoning restrictions.  It was almost like the dwarves didn't want him and his farm there.  But they had never tried turnips, so they didn't really know what they were missing.~
@11500 = ~Once those turnips started to sprout things changed in a hurry.  Turns out the dwarves of that particular clan LOVED turnips.  Fried, baked, boiled, whipped, pureed, mashed - you couldn't find a meal of the day that they didn't have turnips with.  Turnips became so fashionable the dwarves began to wear clothes made from turnips.  Never did a dwarf look so snazzy (or smell so appetizing) as when he was dressed up in a turnip top hat and turnip tails, with turnip skin shoes to complete the ensemble.  And with his turnip business booming, Kimble found himself with more wealth than he knew what to do with.  Just walking around his house was an effort, what with all the mountains of gold spilling out of every door of every room.~
@11501 = ~Happy ending?  I never said any such thing.  Kimble was rich, true enough, but it turned out his dwarven love didn't share her clan's fondness for turnips.  In fact, she was deathly allergic.  She did her best to avoid the lethal vegetables, but as popular as Kimble's crops were it was only a matter of time until she accidentally ate one.  It killed her, of course.  Heartbroken, Kimble tried to return to his own people.  But the dwarves weren't just going to let him and his turnips leave.  They threw him in prison and demanded he reveal the secrets of turnip farming, but that isn't something you can just teach.  You either have the gift or you don't, and dwarves don't.  In the end Kimble's frail body succumbed to the dwarves' torture and interrogation and he left to join his beloved in the afterlife.  And that particular clan of dwarves discovered that turnip farmers were almost as tasty as the turnips themselves.  Or so I've heard.~
@11502 = ~Yes, Jan.  I have already heard that tale, thank you.~ [MAZZ2510]
@11503 = ~I am a druid, yes... and of course I would be happy to answer any of your questions, although that mischievous look of yours tells me I am about to be made fun of.~ [CERN2509]
@11504 = ~I... I apologize, Sarevok.  I know that there are reasons for your presence amongst us, but... you seem so unnatural to me that I cannot help but be repelled.~ [CERN2513]
@11505 = ~That's exactly the kind of thing Twin-Hammers would say.  He was a ruthless, savage, bloodthirsty outlaw who would kill anyone or anything that got in his way.  He used to repeatedly terrorize a certain gnomish village he frequently wandered through in his never ending quest for profit and bloodshed.~
@11506 = ~Ah.  I have given that considerable thought, actually.~
@11507 = ~Alas, Uriah met his end in that street.  With his first blow he broke his hammer on Hackman's shield, and that was it.  Weaponless, he wasn't much of a match for the mighty Clint.  If my uncle had only been named Twin-Hammer because he carried two weapons he might still be alive today.  But Uriah got his nickname for the mighty hammer he carried in his belt and the even mightier... uh, 'hammer' he had *beneath* his belt, if you get my drift.  A fine instrument to have, but not much good in a fight.~
@11508 = ~It's not you personally, though I am concerned with the gadgets you are often fiddling with.~ [CERN2510]
@11509 = ~Ah, Viconia my dusky jewel... I was merely admiring your natural grace, your striking beauty and your exotic voice.  You could surely have made a fine career on the stage.~
@11510 = ~Oh?  'Tis not so at all.  I find all of this a marvel to behold, indeed.  'Twould be rare to find something to compare even on the planes.~
@11511 = ~Only through destruction and death is rebirth possible, my dove.  'Tis the natural way of things.~
@11512 = ~It's not *natural* to cheer it on, to hasten the process!  You have to fight against that kind of evil, Haer'Dalis!  To not do so would be... unthinkable!~
@11513 = ~And who says such a process is evil?  'Tis a narrow view you've founded for yourself, my dove, though not unexpected.  Perhaps with experience and travel your eyes will be opened a little.~
@11514 = ~I... see.  I knew we were different, my bard... but not this different.~
@11515 = ~Oh... I was just thinking about Saradush.  All those poor people!  Killed because of some power-hungry Bhaalspawn!  All that anguish, I just can't believe it!~ [AERI2524]
@11516 = ~Aye, 'tis a wonder to behold, is it not?~
@11517 = ~I understand your sympathy for the townsfolk, my dove, and I love you for it all the more.  But 'tis nothing to shy one's gaze from.  Entropy is a good thing... the forces we are witnessing are completely enthralling...~
@11518 = ~Yes, it does!  You... you would not only advocate that Saradush's destruction was a good thing, you would say that we should *assist* in its destruction!  The more the better!~
@11519 = ~But shall your shining example not guide us down the proper path, Sir Keldorn?~
@11520 = ~My assistance was not required in this case, but in essence you are correct.  All things are torn down to create the new.  'Tis a cycle that we are part of and must accept.~

@11525 = ~'Tis only that I see you in an unguarded moment, at times... and I see the ache in your heart reflected in your eyes.  It saddens this sparrow to know there is no-one to hold you close, Imoen.~

So along comes this three-armed Baalor (there's a longer story about why the Baalor had only three arms, and besides the fact that he was nicknamed 'Smart Mouth' by the greater powers in the Abyss I won't go into it any more than that) who flies into Candlekeep in the middle of the night and storms his way over to Winthrop's cell and drinks the milk.  The Baalor, however, had misheard the gossip and thought that he was drinking the milk of a pregnant glabrezu.  Don't ask me why.~

@11541 = ~My experiences?  Suffering, tiefling... suffering you cannot fathom.  Each level of pain worse than the first, each layer of torment bringing new tortures.~
@11542 = ~Do you think she would listen to us?  You can trust a Turmish mage about as far as you can kick him... and even then it's not a bad idea to carry a good thumping stick.  But, alas, Auntie Sara just cackled in her most villain-like way and was determined to carry on with her plan to hypnotize the Sword Coast.  Alas, she was completely undone by an over-the-top exposition she gave to a spy that she had captured... and who subsequently escaped, of course, before she could have him killed.  It's what villains do, I understand, when they're not busy defiling iron.~
@11543 = ~Wait... this is just a joke to you, isn't it?~
@11544 = ~Ah, yes.  I know the fellow.  Handsome young gnome, apple of his mother's eye.  Wealthy, debonair, beloved by all.  Your stepfather was a fortunate man to have met him.~
@11545 = ~No doubt.  I've been saving some rather excruciating torture techniques for the occasion.~
@11546 = ~It's been a grand fight, eh mage? Can you better cap a life than with blood betwixt the toes and the flames of hell itself! Ha ha!~ [KORG2509]

@11548 = ~Ye think yer healin' powers make ye indispensable, drow?  I wonder, can ye raise yerself from the dead if I slit yer dusky throat?~

@11550 = ~And why have you not already done so, Korgan?  Like all your kind you lack the courage to act when you fear the consequences of failure.  That is why the drow use your kin as slaves.~

@11556 = ~You know, this reminds me of the time Uncle Scratchy laid me flat with the handle of a horseman's flail.  'Look behind you!', he says.  'Why?  What's behind me?', I say.  'A Tiberian Dung Beetle!', he cries, looking frantic.  So of course I scream in terror and look behind me... and lost a bag of the most scrumptious turnips ever to come out of Scornubel.  Ma Jansen was furious and the lump was more painful than six weeks with the Calimshite Itch.~

@11573 = ~When Bhaal held sway over my soul, I reveled in the bloody carnage I wrought.  But my will was not my own.  As captivating as your dominance might be, Viconia, I will not surrender my being to the whims of another again... be they god or drow.~
@11574 = ~Then you are of no further interest to me, rivvil... though I suspect your dreams will be filled with dark imaginings of the hedonistic pleasures you have denied yourself.  But even your dreams will be but a pale shadow of my true decadence.~

@11579 = ~I'm frightened of what's to come, <CHARNAME>.  So much has changed so fast.  I love you, but what if... what if I suddenly lose you?  What if some irresistible force tears us apart?  That's why I wanted to wait.  Until things were more... stable.~
@11580 = ~I offered my services to you because I knew you would require my aid and my knowledge, and because I knew yours would be the path of power.  But I also cannot foresee you allowing me my freedom.~
@11581 = ~I... I know you're right, <CHARNAME>.  I'm just so worried about losing you later on that I'm afraid to let myself love you now.  It's foolish, but I can't help it.  I want to let myself love you, <CHARNAME>.  Please, just be patient with me a while longer.~
@11582 = ~I think you made it in just under the wire, my love.  *grin*~
@11583 = ~I... I have to go!  I have to see if my mother...*sob* It can't be true, can it?  I have to... I have to return to Faenya-Dale!~ [AERI2503]
@11584 = ~Someday I plan to go back to Faenya-Dale.  But not now.  Not if it means deserting you.  I swore to stay with you, <CHARNAME>, and I will.  I won't let a ghost from my past destroy everything we have built together.~
@11585 = ~Ah, my love.  I always find your innocence so appealing.~
@11586 = ~What was I thinking?  You are truly the epitome of mature and matronly womanhood, Aerie.~
@11587 = ~I... have been considering your words.  I have changed my outlook, and I think perhaps it may be a good thing.  I feel I must... thank you.~ [SAREVO55]
@11588 = ~Yes, my love.  We must draw strength from each other.  Perhaps... perhaps if you wrap your arms around me I will be able to sleep tonight... Ah, the comfort of your touch keeps the dark visions at bay.  Sleep well, my love, until the morning.~
@11589 = ~Go. Do what you must. I... I love you.  (Jaheira kisses you, and then turns away, resigned to the decision she feels you have already made.)~
@11590 = ~Yes... (ahem)... I suppose we shall see.~ [JAHE2521]
@11591 = ~No, I mean the name.  What do you think of Quayle as a name?  For a child.  A boy.~
@11592 = ~Please... don't tell the others.  Not yet.  This joyous news is for you and me alone right now.  I'll... I'll give you some time to let this news settle in before we discuss our future plans.  Hurry... let's catch up with the others before they get suspicious.~
@11593 = ~Ah... it seems we are never allowed a moment of rest. Still, I am glad we have accomplished so much.~ [JAHE2502]
@11594 = ~Jaheira, I'm sorry, but I can't talk right now.~
@11595 = ~You... you are a monster!  A cruel, heartless monster!  I can't stay here... I won't let my child be poisoned by your evil!  I hope you burn in the Abyss, <CHARNAME>!~
@11596 = ~That is important to me, <CHARNAME>. There must be closure to the past for us to... to move forward.~
@11597 = ~The safest place is here with us, where we can protect our child.~
@11598 = ~The healing magics that restore my health will restore the health of the unborn child in my womb, even resurrecting it to life, if that should be necessary.~
@11599 = ~Will you truly hear? You are so unsure of the future, of your feelings, even with my reassurances.~
@11600 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>!  *giggle*  Such ceremonies are not the custom of my people!  True, we Avariel have weddings, but they are usually grand and formal events reserved for nobility and political alliances cemented through marriage.~
@11601 = ~Well, maybe it's time to start if this is going to work out between us.~
@11602 = ~I have been thinking about us, my mrann d'sinss.  Perhaps thinking too much.  Dwelling on such things leads only to head-aches and confusion, don't you agree?~ [VICO2504]
@11603 = ~A fate for you and who else? Not me. There is no place in such a fate for me.~
@11604 = ~Oooh, aren't you sweet. Okay, beautiful, you and me. Here we go.~
@11605 = ~Ah, this time comes sooner than I expected... I have little experience with the gestation period of the Avariel.  Do not give me that look, <CHARNAME>.  Did you really think we were so blind we would not see Aerie's swollen belly beneath her robes?  Fortunately I have prepared some herbs to ease her pain during this coming ordeal.~
@11606 = ~Mmmm, yes, you have always shown enthusiasm for this part of our relationship.  Let's see if you can translate that into a level of exertion that will please me, my mrann d'sinss...~
@11607 = ~Congratulations, <CHARNAME>.  Soon this tiny one will be planting his wee feet into the backside of evil, just like his daddy!  We should give him a tiny sword to wave at the villains as we battle!  Oh... Boo says that may not be such a good idea.~
@11608 = ~Think of it, <CHARNAME>... a whole town of rivvin destroyed simply to get to you!  Ha ha ha!  If anything spoke of your destiny as a being to be feared, this is it!~
@11609 = ~All I'm saying is that the decision may not be up to us.~
@11610 = ~Perhaps this is not the best place for this discussion, my lady, but... I must ask.  Does it not seem an injustice that even as you vanquish your enemies others instantly spring up to take their place?  Have you no regrets about what has become of your life?~ [ANOM2502]
@11611 = ~I prayed we might find a brief respite from the fighting and enjoy each other's company in a time of peace, my love.  But it seems the fates have decreed otherwise.~
@11612 = ~... No.  No, I do not think I can change so much, despite my words.  I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.  Let us... let us just move onwards and forget I said anything.~
@11613 = ~I know your uncertain destiny must weigh heavily upon your heart, my love, and I merely sensed you were of despondent spirit.  My feeble words were meant to comfort you.~
@11614 = ~Promise me that, my mrann d'sinss.  I would rather remember you strong than know that you had given up the promise of true power for some distracting affection.~
@11615 = ~I am at my lady's service - in heart, mind and especially body.  *grin*  Your slightest wish is my command.  Rest assured that I will prove my fealty this evening, my love.~
@11616 = ~It will take more than comforting words to dispel these demons from my past, <CHARNAME>!~
@11617 = ~Snap out of this, Anomen. Remember what you told me:  regret is a luxury of the weak.~
@11618 = ~Good.  Then I have only one thing I wish to say to you, my mrann d'sinss.~
@11619 = ~I know there is much that is uncertain in your destiny;  even the Gods cannot say what lies ahead for you.  For us.  Have you given much thought to... our future?~
@11620 = ~I do not presume to know what lies ahead, <CHARNAME>.  And if it is within my power, I will ever remain by your side.  But such choices may not be ours to make, my lady.  We are among the most powerful beings to currently walk the Realms.~
@11621 = ~Nay, my love... I will hold you close for as long as I can.  Forever, if it is possible.  But we are now legendary people, and the forces aligning against our relationship are legendary as well.~
@11622 = ~... there.  Now, my marvelous terror of a <PRO_MANWOMAN>... now we go and finish this.~
@11623 = ~Your words are noble, but naive.  Our love is everything to me, <CHARNAME>.  But what is that in the face of your destiny?  You are a shaper of history, perhaps even someday you will become a god.  Can you truly say you would give that all up for me?~
@11624 = ~It is... something I have never said to you, before, because I was unsure if I truly felt that way.  I have called you mrann d'sinss... lover... of my ssinssrigg... my love... but these are drow words.~
@11625 = ~I do not revel in the deaths of the innocent, <CHARNAME>.  But the raw power unleashed on the city - did it not make your skin tingle?  Could you not feel a charge in the air?~
@11626 = ~Intoxicating but dangerous, my love.~
@11627 = ~Of course there is danger with such intoxication.  It can be addictive.  We must be careful not to let bloodlust and battle glory blind us to the true horror of what we have witnessed.  I suppose that is the sinister seductiveness of power.~
@11628 = ~Truly, my love... I cannot even imagine what this must be like for you - one who has the power of a god in her veins.  I am glad we were able to discuss this, though I feel there is much we both need to think on.~
@11629 = ~Death is truly a part of you, my lady.  I know this.   And that is what troubles me.  I feel the stir of battle churning my blood.  The glory of a defeated foe at my feet thrills me.  These feelings are not right, my love.  They are dangerous,  as is our own power.~
@11630 = ~You're pathetic, Anomen!  Sniveling, weak and afraid of what my destiny will bring!  You make me sick.~
@11631 = ~*sigh*  Another awkward silence between us, my love.  I fear I have not the words to entertain and amuse you as a proper courtier should.~ [ANOM2507]
@11632 = ~Ah, perhaps the problem is mine.  I was raised in a culture of chivalry; romance was an art, a craft of specific forms and patterns.  Poetic professions of adoration and flattery were the expected ways for a knight to show his love.~
@11633 = ~You are unlike any woman I have ever known, <CHARNAME>.  With you, these platitudes of love cannot express my true feelings.  And without them... I don't know what to say.  I am like a warrior without armor or weapons:  vulnerable and defenseless.~
@11634 = ~Then... then let me just say I love you, and leave it at that.~
@11635 = ~*grin*  This is much easier, <CHARNAME> - I fear I have been wasting valuable energy in my efforts to elevate my speech to the language of love.  Perhaps tonight you will be the beneficiary of my sudden extra reserves...~
@11636 = ~Is there something you are trying to tell me, Anomen?~
@11637 = ~We cannot possibly have a wedding now, not while the Bhaalspawn are being slaughtered all around us!~
@11638 = ~Take this ring:  it was my sister's.  I keep it near to remind me of her.  It is not much, my lady, but let it serve as a sign of our love, and a symbol of our commitment to each other.~
@11639 = ~Keep the ring near to your heart, my love.  It shall bind us together when the forces of the world try to tear us apart.  A single kiss to seal the deal, my lady...~
@11640 = ~My love, I must talk to you.  I sense we are nearing... well, in truth I do not know.  But your destiny fast approaches.  I feel an ending is near, a time of great consequence for you, and for us.~ [ANOM2509]
@11641 = ~Truly I would like nothing more, my lady.  But you cannot pretend things are anything but what they are.~
@11642 = ~I... I want you to know that I will not stand in the way of your destiny, my love.  Our love is the most important thing in my world,  more important than my family, my honor.  Even my childhood dreams to join the Order seems insignificant beside my feelings for you.~
@11643 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not.  Ah, <CHARNAME>... I am but a fool, struggling against the wisdom of the ages.  What do I know?  My words are nothing; they can only cause you distress at a time when you need to be most focused.~

This ability allows the rogue to set a powerful trap that unleashes a fireball which causes 10D6 damage (save vs. spells for half damage) , and will knock its victims off their feet.

@11650 = ~Set Time Trap
This ability allows the rogue to set a magical trap that casts a weaker version of the high level Time Stop spell. For 10 seconds, the flow of time slows for all but the rogue. Often, a rogue will use this trap to get behind an opponent for a free attack.~
@11651 = ~Avoid Death
With a superhuman effort, a high-level rogue can avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 5 rounds and during this time the rogue's save vs. death receives a bonus of 5, hit points are increased by 20 and the rogue becomes immune to death magic for the duration of the ability.~

@11660 = ~A deal?  Well, spank me silly and call me a rutabaga.  This fellow must be some kind of merchant, indeed, to still be bargaining long after he's dead.  Sounds a bit like ol' Uncle Salebottom.  "Jan, my nephew," he boasted one day, "I'm going to continue making money long after I'm dead!"  And he did, too.  Ten gold apiece for each of his fillings and twenty for his left foot.  Don't ask.~

To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.  The wielder of an enchanted katana, such as this one, must respect the customs of Kara-Tur and of the samurai who once carried this blade into battle.  Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

"Illasera was chosen to be the one to go after the powerful Bhaalspawn, the straggler.  What is <PRO_HISHER> name?  <CHARNAME>?  Hmph.  Yaga-Shura should have been the one chosen.  The fool would have stood no chance.  But now is not the time to disobey orders.  Yaga-Shura can bide his time."

The remainder of the journal contains information on the gathering of Yaga-Shura's army and various tactical matters which, while interesting, are not particularly relevant.~
@11782 = ~The magic of the pocket plane has placed you in the wilderness on the road to Yaga-Shura's home. Your map has been updated and you shall have to make your way to Yaga-Shura's areas and discover the source of his invulnerability.~
@11783 = ~Well, no, that's true.  Would you believe I truly didn't intend that to work out as it did?  No, I suppose you wouldn't.  Well, you survived just fine... so no harm done, right?~
@11784 = ~Oh, I don't know.  100,000 gold?  That'll get me a new ship.  And, after all... it's not like you'll need gold where you're going, am I right?~
@11785 = ~Well, I did my best, <CHARNAME>.  Sorry, but Balthazar had me over a barrel, so to speak.  Good luck!~
@11786 = ~You... are?  Should I believe you?  ... yes.  Yes, somehow I do.  You have far more power than I... if that is your true goal, then you have a far better chance than I.~
@11787 = ~Do you know how to get inside the monastery?~
@11788 = ~I've heard such things before. Your threats are meaningless.~
@11789 = ~Do you know any way into the monastery?~
@11790 = ~Why... hello, there.  Hm.  It's not often I get people barging into my shop.  It's the reason I chose such a remote locale for my research, after all.~
@11791 = ~... no, no.  I can't go on having folks laughing at me.  I can't bear it.  Just... just go away, you.  I'm sure you have lots of adventures to be on about, don't mind me.~
@11792 = ~(sigh)  If you had the appropriate material, then... perhaps.  But I deal with very specific requirements.  It... well, you wouldn't understand.~

@11796 = ~I commend you for your good taste, my <LADYLORD>!  If you had, say, a trio of such specimens... specifically in the golden, silver *and* bronze variety... well, I could make you an outfit which the gods themselves would fear!~
@11797 = ~My <LADYLORD>!  It is so rare to find three such extraordinary specimens!  If... if you would allow me to work, I could put them through the Pantaloon Ergo-Magical Transmogrifier right now!~

Range: Caster
Duration: 1 rounds/5 levels
Casting Time: 1
Saving Throw: none 

When this power is called upon by the Bhaalspawn, they immediately do extra damage with each hit to their target with any melee weapon they wish (whether it be fist or sword), their dark energies traveling through their weapon and assaulting their victim... and absorb that damage as healing to themselves.
The effects vary by level as follows:
10th: 2 rounds, 4 hp extra damage, 4 hp healed
15th: 3 rounds, 6 hp extra damage, 6 hp healed
20th: 4 rounds, 8 hp extra damage, 8 hp healed
25th: 5 rounds, 10 hp extra damage, 10 hp healed
30th: 6 rounds, 12 hp extra damage, 12 hp healed~

@11803 = ~This gem appears similar to a diamond... yet it is a brilliant, glittering,  opaque white and radiates a field of cold around it so intense that it is impossible to touch it.  Even wrapped in several layers of cloth it cools the air in the vicinity.~

@11805 = ~I shall not allow you to exist.  Stop me... if you can.~
@11806 = ~But it's not terrible.  It's inviting.  It calls to you.  And if you give into it, if you offer your entire heart up to it, everything becomes crystal clear.  One murder, two, a thousand... it all becomes part of you.~
@11807 = ~... is retribution.~
@11808 = ~Breath Potion

This potion will allow you to hold your breath for longer than you normally would be able to. It should allow you to swim through one of the longer tunnels. It need only be carried to function.

@11816 = ~The tunnels.  *cough*  The tunnels are the key.  Abazigal's caverns are connected by underground tunnels.  You will have to explore them to find your way through this maze of caves.~
@11817 = ~You will need an empty Breath Potion flask if you wish to gather the liquid.~

@11820 = ~I hid this rope within the hem of my robes, in case a chance to escape this horrid place ever came. *cough* *cough* Take it.  It will guide you through even the longest tunnels.~
@11821 = ~Thanks for the rope, sucker!  I'll just leave you here and be on my way!~
@11822 = ~When Balthazar sent me here on my... mission *cough*  I brought a powerful Scroll of Reversal to break the geas and open the entrance to Abazigal's private chambers. *hack* *cough*~
@11823 = ~Abazigal's Enclave

I discovered one of Balthazar's followers imprisoned here.  Before he died the monk explained how I can find and defeat Abazigal.  I need to find the Scroll of Reversal to break the geas that both enslaves a dragon guardian and seals the entrance to Abazigal's inner enclave.

The caverns here are all connected by underwater tunnels.  Luckily I now have a rope and some more of the water breathing potion to allow me to explore the various tunnels.  Like it or not, I guess I'm going spelunking.~
@11824 = ~But first... let's make sure we're not bothered by any of your so-called friends.  This is a private matter.~ [CYRIC02]
@11825 = ~You seem... familiar, somehow...~
@11826 = ~You're... the current God of Murder?~
@11827 = ~Tsk.  You'd think Bhaal would have spread his seed out a little more intelligently.  No matter.  I am Cyric.  The reigning God of murder... not to mention of strife, lies and illusion.~
@11828 = ~Yes, you would know, wouldn't you?  I am, indeed, Cyric... God of murder as well as strife, lies and illusion amongst other things we needn't get into.~
@11829 = ~Most recently I've recovered from a little bout of madness... not that it's important to you... only to find the seedlings of the former holder of my office everywhere, like weeds.~
@11830 = ~There's only a bare few of the spawn left, now, of course.  Like you.  I'm not convinced you've the temperament or desire for the office of murder... but one can never be too sure.  You can imagine my concern, hm?~
@11831 = ~As opposed to what?  Some grisly avatar like the Slayer?  A cloud of smoke?  A massive face in the sky with a booming voice?  I am only here to talk, to gauge your threat to me... if any.~ [CYRIC04]
@11832 = ~Hah! Observers! Teach this monkey a lesson! (Hmm... perhaps there's a better word than monkey... no matter.)~
@11833 = ~You're a god... I doubt you'd have any reason to fear me, or anyone.~
@11834 = ~To be honest, I can't really leave my experiments. They're quite fragile. Plus they smell nice. Like cheese.~
@11835 = ~But it's no matter.  Can't undo what's already been done... and if you try, well, that leads to all sorts of different problems.  And I'd rather not open *that* bag of worms once again.~ [CYRIC12]
@11836 = ~As for you... you might decide to seek my realm of influence.  If you even get that far, that is.  But it remains to be seen if you even have the power to attempt it, never mind succeed.~ [CYRIC13]
@11837 = ~As for you... I doubt you will seek my realm of influence.  If you even get that far, that is.  I have little desire to see yet another godling who might be a possible opponent... if you even have any power worth noting.~ [CYRIC14]
@11838 = ~Needless to say, I took a dagger and tried to harvest an eye for my experiments. The little bastard dived into one of the pools just east of here and disappeared.~
@11839 = ~These men here. They seemed interested in 'Quests' and 'Adventure' earlier.~
@11840 = ~Yes, I suppose they do. You seem resourceful. Find some way to help them and I'm sure they'll take the 'Quest'.~
@11841 = ~Iycanth's Eyestalk

I've been sent to fetch and retrieve a gauth beholder's eyestalk for the mad wizard, Iycanth. Apparently, the gauth has disappeared into one of the pools to the east of Iycanth's lab.

The job seems beneath me, though Iycanth suggested subcontracting to a small group of adventurers. They have, however, been turned to stone. If I want to give them the 'Quest', I'll have to turn them back. Regardless, when I have the eyestalk, I am to find my way to the wizard's lab and exchange it for the Scroll of Reversal.~
@11842 = ~<CHARNAME>!   As a member of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart I cannot stand by while you sow such evil in your wake.  All who oppose evil join my cause!~
@11843 = ~You again! What do you want now?~
@11844 = ~I have the gauth's eyestalk.~
@11845 = ~Uh... I guess I should thank you for saving us.  Is there some way we brave adventurers can repay your kindness?  Something we can do for you to fulfill our debt of gratitude.  Anything?  Anything at all?~
@11846 = ~Ah! Tim, cast Magic Missile! Nanoc! Attack! I'm outta here!~
@11847 = ~I call the shots around here, Harper!  Or did I miss a vote where we decided you were in charge?~
@11848 = ~You... you are not the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I thought you were, <CHARNAME>.  I can no longer stay by your side.~
@11849 = ~The djinn grins widely, winking at you.  "Perhaps the wisest of courses, spellweaver.  Very well... it shall be as you wish."~
@11850 = ~"The spell you have cast is an attempt to temporarily control vast cosmic power.  It is unstable, and therefore only truly useful in combat events... unless you have years to devote to the formulation of your wish, of course."~
@11851 = ~"And I," here the djinn looks pleased, "will use my vast intelligence to distort your purpose as I please.  Don't feel bad... the forces at work here are such that it is not often that one gets what one truly hopes for."~
@11852 = ~"But you can certainly try.  The wise often do well... and you spellweaver are often quite wise, yes?"  It taps its quill thoughtfully on its head.  "Do you wish to begin, then?"~
@11853 = ~Fortunately, you are quick to catch on.  Before long, you begin tricking the djinn's phrasings yourself, leaving it quite frustrated.  You still doubt you'll get what you want, but chances are the djinn won't be able to trick you.~
@11854 = ~You are wise enough to keep pace with the djinn, preventing the being from taking total advantage of you.  Still... the contract is hard to understand and you wonder at the end result.~
@11855 = ~Throughout the process, the djinn continues to baffle you... and you are not even sure if your desired wish will be similar to your original premise.  At best, you stall the worst of the clauses.~
@11856 = ~Your lack of wisdom leaves you at a complete disadvantage.  Throughout the writing of the contract, the djinn all but bullies you mentally into a position of watching him all but write the complex document on his own... there are few objections you can make.~
@11857 = ~Why do I continually find myself subjected to these inane conversations?  We should focus on shaping the destiny of all Faerun... and not discussing cheese!~
@11858 = ~I admit I'm no cheese expert, but have you taken a good whiff of your pets recently?  I don't know anyone who'd put something with the stench of this place in their mouth.~
@11859 = ~So young and eager... *sigh*  I can hardly believe that I was ever as naive and innocent as these three.~
@11860 = ~While the babe still dwells within me, it will draw its strength from me.~
@11861 = ~If the child is born before we finish our adventures, I shall bundle it on my back, as is the custom of my people, the Avariel.~
@11862 = ~(sigh)  Alright, my love.  We'll think of a name for him later, if you like.  Just allow me to call him Quayle until we do is all I ask.  Just... a little while.~
@11863 = ~It scratches its head for a moment before replying.  "There's big trouble, boss.  The time has come for all you Bhaalspawns.  The jig's up.  Time to pay the piper, you know.  Just don't get cracked is all I can say about it."~
@11864 = ~The impish creature grins from ear to ear.  "Well... kill them before they kills you.  That's what my grandpappy always said.  Until he was, um, killed..."~
@11865 = ~It blinks several times, thinking hard.  "It... seems to me that there is a reason that all the children of Bhaal are coming together.  You must end it, I think."  It grins suddenly.  "And, of course, you must win!"~
@11866 = ~"The only answer must be obvious... you must find this female who has lied to you and kill her!  You must travel to the Abyss and her life must be ended!"  It shrugs.  "Or, at least, that's what I would do."~

Gargantua was self-proclaimed lord of his immeasurable lower regions until his son, Pantagruel, questioned the accuracy of the ruler. With his shortcomings exposed, great Gargantua lay prostrate upon the ground while Pantagruel sought to cover his cuirass in case his now governing body lost its sway. He was warned that the people would cut him no slacks, but he never listened, and had burned his britches behind him. Undaunted, he fulfilled his animus with the robes of his father, as uncomfortable as that might sound, and shaped the Metal "Unit" with his own hands. 

The rule of Pantagruel was a discommoding morass, his armor eventually suffering a breach in the breech that proved his undoing. As his basket left the pantry, so to speak, his regime fell to insurrection, and so complete was the sacking that not even his Metal "Unit" could be found. The component pieces, a pantaloon triumvirate, were lost in the annals of time. 

You now bear the awesome responsibility of the Metal "Unit". Gussets of wind, seams like reality, pockets of resistance, the seat of power, and legs as flared as your temper. Polish it well; the onus is now on you.

It has begun.

Even before I left Suldanessellar, the news had already begun pouring in from everywhere... tales of armies on the move, whole towns being destroyed to get at some lone wizard, massive carnage and destruction along the entire Sword Coast.  It all links to the Bhaalspawn.  They are being hunted, or hunting each other... whatever the case, wherever a Child of Bhaal is, violence soon follows.  And so the fear and panic have spread, with any innocent even suspected of having the taint being driven from their homes or killed outright.

Even the elven lands are not immune, and I sensed considerable relief upon my departure from the very city that I helped save.  Ellesime, at least, offered me some advice... there is a part of the old elven woods that house old ancestor spirits of the elves, spirits locked within giant carved faced made so long ago not even the elves remember when they were created.  It is a sacred place reserved only for royalty, but Ellesime is allowing me to enter the dale and glean what wisdom I can.

I have gone alone... none of the elven forest folk want to be near me.  And while no others are supposed to be here, I am sure that danger stalks me, yet.  I should prepare my weapons and equipment and be ready for anything...~
@11924 = ~Chapter 10

All has finally been revealed to me.

Bhaal is not returning.  Perhaps he might have, if evil could be counted on to do as it is asked.  Bhaal left the key to his resurrection with his High Priestess, and she has betrayed him, using all the power of the collected souls of Bhaal's dead children to turn herself into a goddess and leave Bhaal dead where he belongs.

Melissan tricked her former master, and she tricked me.  She manipulated all the Bhaalspawn, even the members of the Five that she had collected secretly to kill the others.  Even Balthazar who didn't trust her and intended to kill her.

I am the last of Bhaal's children... but even now Melissan holds most of the power that he once had.  She is in the Abyss... and my only means of getting there was to destroy the pocket plane that I had unintentionally created.  I am ready to face her, now.

There is no turning back.~
@11925 = ~Chapter 9

Saradush has been sacked.  Yaga-Shura had burst through the wall to find a Bhaalspawn... myself.  I was not there, however, so he contented himself with destroying everything in his path, including all the other Children of Bhaal that had sought refuge, there.

Melissan survived, though she seemed devastated.  I am one of the few Bhaalspawn that remain... the only others are a group comprised individually of the most powerful of Bhaal's children that remain in Faerun.  They have been hunting their siblings, including me, but to what end even Melissan doesn't know.  Perhaps they seek to raise Bhaal and become his earthbound avatars.  Perhaps they seek to become gods themselves.  But they will not rest until I am dead... and their powers combined are enough to destroy even me, so Melissan claims.

I have little choice but to take Melissan's offer of help.  She knows of a safe haven in the Calimshite desert... a place called Amkethran... from which I can plan how best to confront these Bhaalspawn who hunt me and end all questions about my future and my destiny... whatever it may truly be... once and for all.~

@11939 = ~Wh... what just happened?  I felt myself... hovering... over my own body.  Something was pulling me away... to a distant place. I fought against it - I couldn't leave Tazit alone.  And then, suddenly, I felt myself being drawn back into my body.~

@11942 = ~Thank you, my <LADYLORD>... you are truly kind and gracious to go to such lengths to help us!~
@11943 = ~I still suspect that no-good thief Hectan was involved - I can clearly see the guilt in his face!  But there is no proof.  Without my spellbook I am virtually powerless to pursue this myself, and as a newcomer to this town I have no one to turn to for help.~
@11944 = ~I thank you for your aid in solving the theft of my spellbook, mighty <CHARNAME>.  Is there anything I can do to aid your investigation?~
@11945 = ~As you wish.  I urge you godspeed.  Without my spellbook I have no way to restock my inventory with the precious scrolls I normally carry.~

@11958 = ~Lazarus' Missing Spellbook

The owner of a local scroll shop has had his spellbook stolen.  Without it, he has no wares to sell.  He suspects a man named Hectan, though Hectan has an ironclad alibi:  he was busy getting drunk down at the local inn.~

@11977 = ~Sarevok in Hell: Part 2

An angel has brought me back to the Abyss to inform me, as far as I can tell, that my destiny as a Bhaalspawn is about to come to fruition.  But I am not quite ready, it seems.  My mind is not prepared to accept all the power of Bhaal's realm... and so it has created a demiplane of my very own, a cocoon by her description, in which I will have to prepare myself.

There's no obvious way out... it's not a very large place.  And already uninvited guests from the neighborhood are showing up.  My old enemy Sarevok, like a bad penny, turned up with a proposal... he will tell me how to get out of the demiplane, and whatever else he knows and is holding back, in return for the smallest slice of my soul to restore him to some semblance of life.  I don't know how prepared I am to do that... I've had enough soul exchanges to last me several lifetimes.  Perhaps I can find a way out on my own, we shall see.~
@11978 = ~Sarevok in Hell: Part 2

An angel brought me back to the Abyss to inform me that my destiny as a Bhaalspawn is about to come to fruition.  But I am not quite ready, it seems.  My mind is not prepared to accept all the power of Bhaal's realm... and so it has created a demiplane of my very own, a 'cocoon' by her description, in which I will have to prepare myself.

None other than Sarevok himself turned up not moments after the angel's departure, and he had a deal in mind: in exchange for knowledge of how to leave the pocket plane as well as information on my destiny, he would be returned to life.  I had little choice but to agree.~
@11979 = ~The Challenges & the Fate Spirit

Sarevok informed me of two important facets of my pocket plane.

First are the challenges.  I am not certain what form these will take, but there are five corridors that lead off from the main room, and somehow I am sure that they will open up as I am ready to face what is beyond.  Sarevok implied that the challenges might be very difficult, and that I may want to consider acquiring back-up.

Which leads me to the 'fate spirit'.  I am not sure how this spirit does what it does, but it seems I have some control over people whose fate is intertwined with my own.  The fate spirit will summon companions for me... Baalors, but possible friends.  To talk to the spirit, I need only interact with it near the 'entrance' to the plane.~
@11980 = ~Meeting with Balthazar

I have finally met with Balthazar, the head of the monastic order in Amkethran, and while he was not exactly welcoming he did allow me to remain in the town so long as I did not attempt to enter the monastery or otherwise interfere in his business... and passed on to me the maps to the Bhaalspawn enclaves that Melissan presumably gave him.

Where Melissan is, now, appears to be a mystery.  I am not entirely certain that this Balthazar is on the level.  Regardless, there is no reason for me to try to get inside his fortress-like monastery and no way that I can see of doing so.  My only path is to investigate the enclaves and confront the Bhaalspawn who are so intent on hunting me.~
@11981 = ~Revelations of the Solar

The Solar has called me to my pocket plane once again, revealing some interesting facets of my past.  When Gorion assaulted the Bhaalist temple and killed my mother, it could very easily have been that Sarevok was taken by the wizard instead of I.  How would our paths have differed then, I wonder?

Gorion must have wanted this kept from me even beyond his death:  his final posthumous words to me that I read on my return to Candlekeep indicated that my mother was intimate with him, an innocent who was impregnated by Bhaal against her will, certainly not that she was one of Bhaal's faithful, willing to sacrifice me as a vessel of his essence to further his return. Perhaps Gorion knew that I would inevitably discover this in my own time, when I had matured enough to be able to accept the complete truth of my past, when the prophecies came to fruition.

While enlightening, it is hard to say what relevance such information has for me in my current situation.  The Solar was cryptic, as usual... but she did open another of the doorways in the pocket plane that leads to another challenge.  What lays beyond I shall have to discover for myself.~
@11982 = ~Revelations of the Solar

Yet another interaction with the Solar... this time concerning my own place in Alaundo's prophecy.  Supposedly, I am the one Alaundo spoke of, but in the way that I am supposed to stop the rest of the Bhaalspawn from wreaking destruction and chaos upon the Sword Coast... rather than being solely responsible for it, myself.  I am unsure how to take this news, as it seems my place in the scheme of this is predestined.  I could be the most savage beast in the Realms, and yet the other Bhaalspawn would still see me as a threat to them?

It seems that this is so.  Whether I like it or not, I have been placed on a path to collide with the destinies of the remaining children of Bhaal.  And it seems my victory would be far preferable to theirs... at least as far as the prophecy is concerned.

Once again, the Solar has opened another of the portals to a challenge in the pocket plane.  There is more for me to learn about myself, yet, it appears.~
@11983 = ~Revelations of the Solar

The powerful Bhaalspawn that I have been fighting, the ones that have been relentlessly hunting the others, call themselves 'the Five'.  Like myself, they are the most potent of our kind and possess a great deal of Bhaal's divine essence.

It appears that they had gathered together for a single purpose... since they were too powerful to fight each other, they would combine their forces and hunt the remainder of the Bhaalspawn.  Then they would raise our sire and become his earthly generals.  They were largely successful, but four of them are now dead: Illasera, Yaga-Shura, Sendai and Abazigal.

The only trick is that they contained so much of Bhaal's essence that the god may be nearer to resurrection than ever.  Perhaps that is what the last of the Five, Balthazar, plans even now.  I have no choice but to return to Amkethran and stop him.  Then, perhaps, this will finally all be over.

The fourth challenge room is now open to me.  It seems odd, considering how close I am to the end, that there is still one more to go even after this.~
@11984 = ~Revelations of the Solar

My course is set.  My last enemy has been revealed.  It is not Bhaal, arisen anew like I had suspected... it is none other than Melissan, and has been all along.

She was once Bhaal's high priestess during the Time of Troubles.  It was supposed to be her in charge of killing all the Bhaalspawn and returning their essences to him... her in charge of Bhaal's resurrection.  He trusted her and she has betrayed him.  She has manipulated the Five to their deaths, manipulated me, and even now seeks to steal the power of her master and become a goddess.

The last of the challenges awaits me.  I must enter that challenge and destroy my protective 'cocoon' that is my pocket plane so that I may enter the Throne of Bhaal to stop Melissan before she is successful.  She MUST not succeed.~
@11985 = ~Hey now, stranger.  Just relax.  We know what you Bhaalspawn are like.  All we're doing is blowing off a little steam.~
@11986 = ~Peragath the Valiant, a great champion of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, carried this shield into battle against a horde of invading Tanar'ri pouring through a gate to the Astral Plane.  Gripped by holy fervor, the mighty paladin single handedly drove back the horde, then foolishly leapt through the Astral gate to finish them off.  The gate collapsed, and both Peragath and the shield were forever lost in the Planes.

@11995 = ~Aerie continued adventuring after leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, driven in her travels to oppose slavery in any form. Her compassion grew tainted by revenge, however; revenge for what had been taken when she was in chains. She might have lost herself entirely had she not stumbled across a group of Avariel winged elves enslaved in Cormyr. They compelled her to come to Faenya-Dale, the home she was originally stolen from, and she learned much while there. Most importantly, she learned she was no longer one of them, and stopped pining for wings she wouldn't use anyway. Aerie eventually became a high priestess in Understone, a gnomish village her mentor Quayle had sometimes spoken of. He had been her true family, and it was among his people that she finally found peace.~
@11996 = ~Aerie and <CHARNAME> would prove inseparable, their adventuring careers becoming secondary to the raising of their son, and eventually a daughter as well. Their later years would hold one last great trek, however, as Aerie still suffered a sadness from her time enslaved and the loss of her wings. Together she and <CHARNAME> sought the Avariel of Faenya-Dale, the winged elves she was stolen from so long ago. They discovered not only her people, but loving parents that had spent years searching for their lost child. With no more mystery or confusion to cloud their lives, it was there, among the clouds, that Aerie and <CHARNAME> would finally be married. Their union, it is said, was blessed by visions of Aerdrie Faenya and Baervan Wildwanderer both.~
@11997 = ~Nalia grew quite powerful after her association with <CHARNAME>. Initially she traveled, learning magical lore and making influential friends, but after a year she returned to Amn and her family home of de'Arnise Hold. She found it in the control of none other than Isaea Roenall, but she was no longer the wayward child that he expected, and single-handedly brought him to justice for his indiscretions. She declared herself the inheritor of her father's ducal title, becoming a beloved ruler, respected archmage, and eventually earning a seat on the Amnish Council of Six itself. She would become a prominent figure in Amn for many years, constantly fighting for the good of the common folk and making many frustrated enemies among the nobility and Cowled Wizards both.~
@11998 = ~No longer with <CHARNAME>, Viconia went on to found a cult dedicated to Shar in the city of Waterdeep. One of her followers betrayed her, however, prompting the slaughter of the whole tainted lot. Shar admonished Viconia strongly for this, but she was unrepentant and again wandered the Realms. Viconia was still formidable, and went on to prevent an attempt by the Knights of the Shield to take over Calimport, and even worked with Drizzt Do'Urden to save the elven city of Suldanessellar from a Zhentarim plot. For this last act, the elves accepted her, and Queen Ellesime bestowed the highest honors of the Seldarine, an accolade never before given to one of her dark kind. Viconia reportedly bowed once without emotion, and then left. Her fate remains unknown.~
@11999 = ~<CHARNAME> and Viconia continued adventuring long after leaving Tethyr. He became an important political figure, and she was his trusted counsel. Eventually Viconia bore <CHARNAME>'s child, which first served to strain their relationship. The birth, however, changed her, and she dedicated herself to raising the boy, teaching him both the ways of the drow and of <CHARNAME>'s people. She marveled at the understanding in his eyes, but, unfortunately, didn't live to see him grow. Viconia was poisoned by a servant of Lolth, her last words whispered to her loving mate in private. <CHARNAME> raised his son in secret, and tales vary on the result. Some say they waged a crusade against the drow, but all agree that the former child of Bhaal never forgot the love of his dark maiden.~
@12000 = ~Haer'Dalis found traveling with <CHARNAME> a fine introduction to the Realms, and once they parted company he was eager to see more. He visited such varied locales as Waterdeep, Neverwinter, and Thay, eventually fleeing each one after innocently immersing himself in local troubles. Later he would befriend a female Cambion and return with her to the Abyss, only to unintentionally end up leading a revolt on several layers of the hells. For a time, Haer'Dalis was the most-hunted man among the planes, but the ire of his enemies could not match his wanderlust, and he eventually found his way back to the city of Sigil unharmed in any permanent fashion. There he rejoined Raelis' acting troupe and was pleased to finally settle down - until the next misunderstanding, of course.~
@12001 = ~With the saga of the Bhaalspawn closed, Minsc fulfilled a long promised oath. He returned to Rasheman, hoping to regale the Icedragon Berserker Lodge with the tales of his deeds, and earn a place within its hallowed halls. His words were not needed. Every tavern in Faerun had a bard singing of the valiant ranger, and he was welcomed as a hero. Eventually he formed his own adventuring company, the Justice Fist, striking fear in the hearts and faces of evil until, in his advancing age, he again set out across the Realms... and disappeared. And what of Boo? Well, what is Minsc without Boo? The two would never be separated, and some say they are together still, up amongst the stars where hamsters are giants and men become legends.~
@12002 = ~Elminster's Ecologies: Appendix IIIa

This time-worn tome is written by the sage Elminster, and apparently part of a much larger body of work containing detailed studies of most of the strange creatures from around Faerun.  

The appendix seems to refer to newly-discovered variations on normal breeds of creatures.  Of particular interest:

"Dense Puddings - a relative of the slimes and molds, this pudding is relatively normal... except when exposed to electricity or fire.  When this occurs, it splits into new puddings and can therefore be very dangerous."

"Fire Trolls - a new form of troll thought to have been created by sorcerous Fire Giants for use as servants and guards.  They are similar to regular trolls in most respects except for their lava-temperature skin and burning touch.  Once they are defeated, they can only be permanently killed by cold or acid."

"Fission Slime - an off-shoot of the slimes and molds, this particular slime will split into new and independent creatures when hit.  It is vulnerable to fire, which will kill it permanently."

"Magic Golems - this rare type of golem is formed from pure magical energy and is completely immune to spellcraft as well as enchanted weapons.  To my knowledge, only weapons without enchantments have any effects on this creature."

"Marileths - while this is apparently a legitimate form of demon, it is one that only an exceptional few have encountered and survived.  The Marileth is a six-armed demon with a human female front half and the back half of a snake.  She is incredibly quick and deadly, and on top of her martial prowess with six swords, she casts spells as well.  Fighters should beware: in addition to being immune to normal weapons and minor enchantments, this demon also likes to cast Immunity to Magic Weapons... which must be dispelled if a fighter is to have any chance with his armaments."~
@12003 = ~The Ghostly Apparition

I encountered a spirit of an old man in the prison.  He is unable to communicate, but is obviously trying to.  From what I can gather, his gravesite has been defiled in some manner.  Perhaps some elven holy water or something similar would put this spirit at peace... although he also seems to be miming for some kind of necklace... or perhaps it's something to do with his head... as well.~
@12004 = ~Meeting Volo

I met the infamous historian, Volo, in Saradush... quite a different meeting from out first encounter long ago and far to the north.  Volo is busy writing a book about me and my adventures and told me a little about what he planned.  An odd feeling, to say the least, to be immortalized so.~
@12005 = ~Dealing With Gromnir

A man by the name of Peltje was babbling about a group of vampires in the city masquerading as protitutes.  They base in the sewers, apparently, and might serve as a way to get inside the sewers... if a dangerous one.  Then again, this Peltje could be as insane as he claims he isn't.~

@12010 = ~Ich kann Euch nicht helfen... aber vielleicht weiß ja einer der Kleriker in meiner Gruppe Rat.~
@12011 = ~Eine... Belohnung? Wir sind doch völlig mittellos, <LADYLORD>. Ich wünschte, ich hätte etwas, das ich geben könnte... Ich kann leider nicht mehr tun, als mich für diese zweite Chance bedanken. Tazit... er wäre ganz alleine gewesen.~
@12012 = ~Die Glocke schwingt tonlos hin und her, offenkundig von einer unsichtbaren Macht gesteuert. In der Wand ist eine Inschrift zu erkennen:



Nehmet Euch in acht, oh Sterblicher und denket an diese Worte:

Achtet wohl das Ritual, denn stille soll die Glocke stehen.

Doch löst der Eingekerkerte jemals seine Fesseln,

so läutet die Glocke Sturm, um Helm zu warnen.

Dann weiß Er, dass Ihr Eure Pflichten vernachlässigt habt,

und sein Zorn wird sein wie die Mittagssonne und alles versengen.~
@12013 = ~Fünf mächtige Bhaalkinder haben sich erhoben - sie ziehen mit ihren Armeen quer durch die Schwertküste und ermorden in einer einzigen Welle der Zerstörung ihre schwächeren Geschwister und unschuldige Bewohner.~
@12014 = ~... und für wie lange, bevor deren Höhepunkt Eure Seele verschlingt.~
@12015 = ~Selbst als Sterblicher begegnet man Euch mit Ehrfurcht und Eure Macht erregt Aufmerksamkeit, geneigte und weniger geneigte.~
@12016 = ~Im Laufe der Jahre verbreiten sich die Sagen Eurer Heldentaten bis ins tiefste Hinterland und in ihren Liedern besingen die Barden Euren Namen in einem Atemzug mit den legendären Helden und Schurken der Geschichte.~
@12017 = ~Euer Leben mag sterblich sein, Eure Zeit jetzt begrenzt, aber das Zeichen, das Ihr im Reich gesetzt habt, wird Euch überdauern.~


@20000    = ~Verbesserte Mönchs-Klasse (by Vlad)~
@20001    = ~MÖNCH: Mönche sind Krieger, die versuchen Perfektion zu erreichen, indem sie ihre Körperbeherrschung und ihre geistigen Fähigkeiten trainieren. Sie sind vielseitige Kämpfer, die vor allem im Kampf ohne Waffen und Rüstungen geschult sind. Mönche können zwar keine Magierzauber wirken, verfügen aber über einzigartige magische Fähigkeiten. Sie sind in der Lage eine subtile Energie namens Ki durch ihren Körper zu kanalisieren und können auf diesem Weg Außergewöhnliches vollbringen. Die weithin bekannte Fähigkeit der Mönche besteht darin, einen Gegner durch einen Schlag mit der bloßen Hand zu betäuben.
Mönche müssen von rechtschaffener Gesinnung sein.
Besondere Vorteile:
Kampffähigkeiten:
- Mönche können einen unbewaffneten Angriff je Runde ausführen. Alle drei Stufen erwirbt er 1/2 zusätzlichen Angriff.
- Mönche erhalten alle 4 Sufen einen Trefferbonus von +1 und einen Schadenabonus +1.
- Mönche können einmal täglich alle 4 Stufen einen betäubenden Schlag ausführen. Für jeden erfolgreichen Angriff, den der Mönch in den nächsten 6 Sekunden ausführt, muss dem Opfer ein Rettungswurf gelingen oder es wird gelähmt. Anmerkung: Diese Fähigkeit modifiziert den normalen Angriff eines Mönches automatisch, spezielles Zielen ist nicht nötig.
- Mönche können bei jeden erfolgreichen Treffer, den ein Zauberwirker erleidet, mit einer kumulative Chance von 10% das Scheitern eines Zaubers verursachen.
- Je weiter sich der Mönch entwickelt, desto mehr Schaden richten seine Fäuste an:
- Stufe 1-2: 1W6
- Stufe 3-5: 1W8
- Stufe 6-8: 1W10
- Stufe 9-14: 1W12
- Stufe 15+: 1W20

Spezielle Fähigkeiten:
- Die natürliche Rüstungsklasse eines Mönches verbessert sich mit der Zeit: Sie beginnt bei 9 und verringert sich dann alle zwei Stufen um 1 bis Stufe 21, dann alle 3 Stufen bis 30, dann alle 5 Stufen bis 40. Darüber hinaus gewinnt der Mönch alle 5 Stufen einen besonderen einmaligen Bonus von -2 auf seine Rüstungsklasse.
- Mönche verfügen über die Fähigkeit, Geschosse abzuwehren. Dadurch erhalten sie alle 3 Stufen -1 auf die Rüstungsklasse gegen Fernkampfwaffen.
- Immunität gegen Festhalten
- Immunität gegen Entzug von Lebensenergie
- Mönche haben die Fähigkeit, die Schriftrollen der Kleriker zu lesen. Ein Mönch kann ein Schnellzugriffsfach mit einer Kleriker-Schriftrolle ausrüsten und sie verwenden, den Zauber wirken und die Schriftrolle bei diesem Prozess verbrauchen.
- Ein Mönch erhält +2 auf seinen Bewegungsfaktor und alle weiteren fünf Stufen nochmals +1.
- Ein Mönch erhält einen anfänglichen Bonus +2 auf Rettungswürfe gegen Zauber.
- Magiewiderstand:
Stufe 1-13:  +1% alle2 Stufen
Stufe 14:    +2% (ein spezieller einmaliger Bonus)
Sufe 15-31: +3% pro Stufe bis 100% Maximum

Besondere Fähigkeiten der Mönche  entsprechend der Stufen:
- Ab der 4. Stufe: Wahre Handlungsfreiheit (Immunität gegenüber Verlangsamung, Festhalten und Lähmungszauber)
- Ab der 5. Stufe: Immunität gegen alle Krankheiten.
- Ab der 7. Stufe: Hand auflegen um zu heilen (2 Trefferpunkte pro Stufe).
- Ab der 8. Stufe: Initiativefaktor -1
- Ab der 9. Stufe: +1 auf alle Rettungswürfe. Der Mönch ist immun gegen Bezauberung. Die Fäuste des Mönchs treffen wie eine magische Waffe +1.
- Ab der 11. Stufe: Im munitätgegen Gift.
- Ab der 12. Stufe: Erneut -1 auf Initiativefaktor. Die Fäuste des Mönchs treffen wie eine magische Waffe +2.
- Ab der 13. Stufe: "Vibrierende Handfläche" einmal täglich. Trifft der Mönch mit seinem nächsten Nahkampfangriff, muss dem Opfer ein Rettungswurf gegen Todesmagie gelingen oder es stirbt.
- Ab der 15. Stufe: Die Fäuste des Mönchs treffen wie eine Waffe +3.
- Ab der 20. Stufe: Der Mönch ist gegen normale Waffen immun. Die Fäuste des Mönchs treffen wie eine Waffe +4.

Angeborene Fähigkeiten:
-  Ermutigen einmal am Tag pro 4 Stufen
-  Heilen einmal am Tag pro 4 Stufen
-  Todesfluch einmal am Tag (bei Stufe 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36)

Besondere Nachteile:
- Der Mönch kann keine Rüstung tragen.
- Der Mönch kann nur die Waffen verwenden, die dem Dieb erlaubt sind.~

@20020   = ~Stab des Dracandros

Der Stab eines Magiers ist meist wesentlich mehr als nur ein hübsch verzierter Wanderstock. Auf den meisten derartigen Stecken liegen zahlreiche starke Verzauberungen. Dieser Stecken stellt da keine Ausnahme dar und der Schöpfer, wer immer es auch war, muss in der Tat sehr mächtig gewesen sein. Der Stecken ermöglicht es dem Magier,  sich feindlicher Magie zu widersetzen und er kann Zauberabwehr wirken. Offensiv kann er sehr gut dazu verwendet werden, den Magiewiderstand der Feinde zu senken und "Magie durchdringen" zu wirken.

In den geheiligten Hallen von Walhalla ruhen die tapfersten aller Krieger. Da sie dem Krieg während ihres Lebens so aufopfernd gedient haben, haben sie es sich verdient, ihr Leben nach dem Tod ehrenvoll in den Hallen Walhallas zu verbringen. Als Gegenleistung für diese Ehre müssen die Krieger jenen dienen, die in Odins Horn blasen. Odins Horn beschwört einen Krieger der 10. Stufe, der dem Beschwörer eine Minute lang dient. Das Horn kann einmal täglich eingesetzt werden.

@20041   = ~Langschwert +4: Drachentöter (Peridan)

Es gibt nur wenige, die es wagen derartige Gegenstände anzufertigen, weil jeder den Zorn der Drachen fürchtet. Und wie könnte man ihren Zorn wohl stärker erregen als durch die Anfertigung von Gegenständen zum Töten von Drachen?! In einer Zeit, die schon lange vergessen ist, bestand jedoch die Notwendigkeit der Drachengefahr zu begegnen. Daher wurde dieses Schwert geschmiedet. Es schützt den Träger durch seine starken Verzauberungen davor, jene Furcht zu empfinden, die nur allzu natürlich ist, wenn man in das aufgerissene Maul eines Drachen starrt. Zudem regeneriert der Träger, wird nicht von Unsichtbarkeit getäuscht und verursacht gar doppelten Schaden gegen die mächtigsten Kreaturen der Reiche.

EIGENSCHAFTEN:

Kampffähigkeiten:
   Magie bannen 
      (wann immer das Schwert einen Gegner trifft)

Ausgerüstete Fähigkeiten:

@20043 = ~Silberschwert

Dies ist wahrlich eine legendäre Waffe namens Vorpal oder Silberschwert. Kein Wunder, dass die Githyanki sie so sehr beschaffen wollten und sie in ihre angestammte Stadt Tu'narath zurückbringen wollten. Vorpal ist ihr Ritualschwert und es strahlt eine dunkle Aura aus, als Ihr es zu untersucht. Die Klinge ist so fein geschärft, dass sie einen Kopf wahrscheinlich mit einem einzigen Schlag durchtrennen könnte.

Zusätzlich dient Vorpal auch dazu, die Welt von den verhaßten Illithiden zu befreien. Diejenigen, die Vorpal handhaben, erhalten einen kompletten Gedankenschild einschließlich Immunität gegen Zauber, Beherrschung, Verwirrung und PSI-Kräfte. Darüber hinaus bietet das Schwert dem Träger Schutz vor Negativer Ebene und die Freiheit, sich unter allen die Bewegung ändernde Zauber zu bewegen.

@20044 = ~Der Ausgleicher

Das Schwert existiert schon so lange, dass sein Ursprung in Vergessenheit geraten ist. Die Zeichen auf der Klinge deuten jedoch darauf hin, dass es im Namen Helms gefertigt wurde. Die Waffe wird auch als "Schwert der Neutralität" bezeichnet und dient offenbar dazu, Wesen von extremer Gesinnung auszulöschen, damit das Universum einen Zustand harmonischen Gleichgewichts erreicht. Je weiter sich jemand von dem wahren Gleichgewicht entfernt hat, desto mehr Schaden richtet das Schwert bei ihm an.

Er unternimmt derzeit seine Daschemma, eine rituelle Reise zur Männlichkeit und sucht Abenteuer und Ruhm in der Schlacht. Es ist auch seine Ehre, der Leibwächter einer jungen Wychalarn aus Rashemen namens Dynaheir zu sein, und wenn jemand versucht, ihr zu schaden, wird er Vernunft in ihre Köpfe prügeln, bis sie es überdenken. Er ist sich nicht sicher, warum sie sie an die Schwertküste geführt hat, aber seine Loyalität ist bedingungslos. Wenn er ihr gut dient und sich in der Schlacht auszeichnet, hofft er, dass er bei der Rückkehr in ihre Heimat in die Eisdrachen Berserker Loge aufgenommen wird. Bisher betrachtet Minsk den Erwerb seines tierischen Begleiters "Boo", einem Wesen, von dem er behauptet, dass es ein Miniatur-Riesenhamster ist, als seine bemerkenswerteste Erfahrung in der Welt im Ausland. Offenbar existieren solche Dinge in den Reichen, aber Minsk hat sicherlich zu viele Schläge auf den Kopf getroffen. Er scheint ein guter Kerl zu sein, aber es ist nur allzu bereit, seiner Berserker Natur zu frönen.~

Meister auf Meister hat diese Klinge gegen zahllose Feinde geschwungen, und das Blut, das mit diesem Schwert vergossen wurde, könnte ein kleines Meer füllen. Will man der Geschichte Glauben schenken, dann kann eine solche Klinge nicht geschmiedet worden sein, und jeder Besitzer scheint ihren Ursprung dem Mythos zuzuweisen, an den er gerade glaubt. Die grandioseste Entstehungsgeschichte ist wohl die eines großen Häuptlings, der zu den Kliffs segelte, die angeblich die Welt begrenzen. Dort griff er ins Leere und seine Willenskraft formte die Klinge aus dem Nichts. Was auch immer die Wahrheit sein mag: Gelangt das Schwert in die richtigen Hände, ist es eine furchterregende Waffe.
