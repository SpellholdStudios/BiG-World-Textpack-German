-== BYOSHIM ~(*Hurrying across to the girl’s side*) Kachiko, the heat of your temper could be felt clear across Faerun! What’s this gnome been saying to ignite such a fire?~
-== BKACHI ~It is nothing Yoshimo, see the flames are cooling already and I am calm once again.~
-== BTAFFIC ~No need to be poking your nose in bounty hunter. Lady here just got a flea in her hose, and you know how woman have hysterics over anything that creeps and crawls.~
-== BYOSHIM ~I know Kachiko, gnome, and a girl who once carefully picked up and removed spiders which two young boys thought to put in her bed as a joke, would not fuss over a flea!~

-~Be warned, the lady doesn’t carry those swords of hers as ornaments, she can handle them as well as I can my own. The lady may not be inclined to give you the same consideration she gave the spiders.~
-== BKACHI ~Thank you Yoshimo, but I can speak for myself. Taffic and I understand each other much better now, don’t we Taffic?~
-== BTAFFIC ~Hmph, maybe! (*Mumbling as he stomps off*) Understand, what is there to understand? When it comes to women you make allowances, understanding doesn’t enter into it.~
-== BYOSHIM ~Ah Kachiko, you must learn to be wary whilst in this land. Have I not warned you that not all the males of this land are not as honourable as those back home?~

-~Have I not tried to impress upon you that many see a pretty woman only as an object to posses or to use and discard to appease their own egotistical nature?~
-== BKACHI ~(*Smiling*) You worry too much Yoshimo. Whilst I have a sword for each hand and magic in my head, no assailant will find Kachiko an easy target.~
-== BYOSHIM ~(*A smile touches his lips*) True, my fierce warrior. Kachiko wielding her two swords is a fearsome sight indeed!~

-~Yoshimo is pleased he was able to persuade her to put her weapons away and allow this humble servant to keep his head.~
-== BKACHI ~(*Putting her arm through his as they begin to walk away*) Ah, but then I always meant to take you to Kara Tur alive to answer the accusations and why carry what can walk!~

-~Besides, apart from the mess and the stink it would make in my backpack had I had to carry it all that way. Severing your head from your body would have left you at a serious disadvantage when it was brought before your accusers.~
