-After entering the secret room at the rear of Vulova’s home and fighting my way through a warren full of his henchmen I finally found myself in what looked to be a guild house of sorts. I was  surprised to also find the bard Leina, frightened but unhurt... It appears that her father had kidnapped her in order to force her into a marriage with one Govan Duvaine, a spoilt, rich boy from one of Athkatla’s most affluent families... who sought to become even richer by joining Leina’s family fortune with his own inheritance. It would seem that the untimely death of his wife, Leina’s mother, had so deranged her father’s  mind that he sought to keep her near him... she being the only link he had left to his dead wife. He believed the marriage would keep her in the city. A sad and lonely man true but the death of a loved one effects us all in different ways. Duvaine then appeared and offered me 20,000 gold to hand the girl over to him... 20,000 gold! All I had to do was tell the old barkeep that Leina had decided to marry Duvaine and then meet with one of the financial advisors to the Duvaine’s, a man named  Killian, on the roof of The Copper Coronet.
