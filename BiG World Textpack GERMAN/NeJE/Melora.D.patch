Are you going to tell me why you were running? Looked to me as if you had a demon from the Nine Hells on your tail.~ GOTO 3

-As I was walking away from all this confusion a halfling lass almost knocked me clean off my feet... accusing me of taking up the all the road when in fact, it was she who was too busy looking behind to see who was in front. Although I admit my mind was in turmoil trying to figure out why Irenicus insisted on those mages taking Imoen when he so clearly addressed me as *god child*, that I wasn't fully aware of where my feet were taking me. Turns out her name is Melora and she is trying to escape the city before some bounty hunter on her tail collects the prize on her head. In exchange for the safe company of my group she has offered her skills as a swashbuckler to aid us... a rogue by any other name, but then, so is Imoen... Still, if I am to find Imoen and Irenicus I am going to need all the allies I can find. This halfling seems spirited enough and if she knows the area then all the better... I hope I don't live to regret this but I have taken her into the group.~ GOTO 9
-  IF ~~ THEN REPLY ~I am in fact about to take my leave of this place, Melora, and your skills are most welcome. Come, I can assure you that you will be safe from both demons and bounty hunters.~ JOURNAL ~Meeting Melora.
