Leina took over the Five Flagons Inn and hosted many beautiful shows and perfomances there. The tavern became so popular that many famous bards, bands and performers, as well as respectable audience, from all over the world visited it frequently. Even Volo himself was always staying for a few nights in the Five Flagons Inn on his way from Calimshan to Baldur's Gate. <CHARNAME> helped Leina managing the Five Flagons Inn, and they lived happily in Athkatla, in the house of Leina's father. However, the happy life did not stop them from leading the nomadic lifestyle and together they traveled the land for many years. In their travels, Leina wrote many new songs and poems, and when they returned to Athkatla, she published a collection of her poetry with the title "All You Need Is Love". It is said that the couple has seen the birth of a son and a daughter. Eventually the tales about <CHARNAME> and Leina became so unbelievable that one can only assume that they were no more.~

Keldorn sent a messenger to the castle of Firecam with a message that he might soon visit the castle. He then proceeded to move his battalion through the King's Arch Bridge, heading towards the south road. However, the scouts detected the Sythillisians army moving towards Ishla.

You take Cyric's ring... IT WILL DESTROY YOU! - Keldorn's words echo in your ears! Not without good reason did he beg you not to don the ring, but now, now he is lying motionless, barely breathing. As you watch his features contorting, you realize that soon, only one God will be able to aid you. Kelemvor... cold and indifferent Kelemvor. You decide that there's no chance to persuade Kelemvor. You feel Cyric's ring burning into your hand and preparing for the worst you put it on.

You watch, as a spectator as your human essence, your soul leaves the body, and as you watch once again Keldorn's words echo through your mind but it is too late.

Volo was composing ballads, telling about the courageous daughter of Bhaal and brisk Cespenar was serving drinks.  Yes-yes, when Keldorn had learned that the little imp was facing the perspective of spending an eternity in Abyss, he offered Cespenar a position of butler in his castle. The imp agreed gladly.
-
-<CHARNAME> hardly managed to survive through the childbirth: gods are not the ones to be born easily. When she finally recovered and their daughter Crystal had grown up a little, the Faercam family took to the road again. Keldorn remembered Kelemvor's order – to teach the young goddess about goodness and justice, this cannot be taught correctly hiding behind castle walls. They traveled through all the Faerun, length and width, they visited Kara-Tur, paid a visit to Ajantis's parents in Waterdeep. But they did come back to the castle occasionally, and on one of their visits the second child, a boy, was born. When Keldorn asked his wife how she wants to name their son, <CHARNAME> has blurted out against her will: "Gorion".
-
-The years passed. And Keldorn started to feel their weight more and more. Even <CHARNAME> has noticed that she feels more comfortable sitting or lying down instead of riding her favorite horse. Her strong health had started to fail her. Self-sacrifices for Keldorn and Imoen, complicated pregnancy and birth-giving, which nearly put her in the grave, made her old much faster then they should've. Crystal became even more beautiful and strong as her father was. There is no need to say how proud Keldorn was, is there? He loved to walk through town, leaning on his thick cane with one hand and on his beautiful daughter's hand with the other.
-
-Once Crystal had entered the weaponry with Keldorn, and then reached for the Carsomyr, as she always did, without any luck though. But, this time it was different. Crystal grabbed her father's two-handed sword easily and Carsomyr illuminated her with the strangest light, which no one had seen before. In that moment Keldorn sadly understood – it is time. "You are right, paladin", - he heard a quiet answer. <CHARNAME>, who felt an affinity of parting, has come into the weaponry hasty with tears in her eyes and leaned on Keldorn's hand. Kelemvor had appeared, he offered his hand to Crystal then and they disappeared together.
-
-But Keldorn and <CHARNAME> weren't alone for long. Kelemvor has appeared again soon and said, that in return for the good education of Crystal he grants them the right to see a new goddess. As he offered his hands, Keldorn and <CHARNAME> understood that he's taking them with him. They had not lived for long, but happily, and died on the same day.~

But one day <CHARNAME> did appear with a child, a boy, in her hands. She laid him on Keldorn's knees and said: "I've named him Romuald. I hope you don't mind? I am going to leave him; you can teach him everything you think is necessary".

Or why there was no one who could teach a small child? <CHARNAME> explained that the gods are too busy and have no time to potter with children. And that such a thing is not common between gods.

Twins have grown up very energetic and restless, being interested in everything, including traveling and adventure. <CHARNAME> and Keldorn took their children and headed for the road. They visited Candlekeep and Gorion’s grave; they found many of their friends; they went far up north in search of Branwen; even visited Koran in Tethir’s forest. After their journey, they came back home and the children’s laughter could be heard in the old castle of Esmeltaran again.
-
-Though Keldorn had officially resigned from his duty in the Order, he and his wife were often asked to help. And though their health sometimes refused them – because of their past life and old wounds from countless battles – Count and Countess Firecam always made the impression of a lively and strong couple, who loved life and each other. Alyana and Thomas got a little brother and later, a little sister.
-
-Spending his evenings in a sitting room with his wife, Keldorn thought how happy he is to have children because the Firecam family will not disappear from the face of the Earth after his death and he has the best wife, a man could have ever wanted. He was soon saddened, for he realized that the hour of parting was not far away… In one of these moments <CHARNAME> turned to Keldorn and whispered: “Don’t be afraid, I will never leave you. Mighty Kelemvor has promised that he will allow us to be together. We will never part.”
-
-Fate has shown its mercy on Keldorn, so he managed to see his daughter Alyana get married and bless the wedding of his elder son, Thomas. The younger daughter, Lorette, has studied wizardry successfully and she was going to continue her study in Waterdeep. Marquez has followed in his father’s footsteps: he wants to be a paladin. Ryan Trawl, who has become a prelate of the Order of Radiant Heart by then, took Keldorn’s son as his squire without hesitation.
-
-One winter Keldorn felt himself much worse. <CHARNAME> leaned to her husband, whispering that he should not worry because Kelemvor isn’t there yet. Keldorn saw the God of Death, who has appeared behind her back, and his heart suddenly grew smaller from suffering: Keldorn didn’t want to part with his wife. But <CHARNAME> approved that her decision to go with him remains still. They hugged each other for the last time and Kelemvor has taken them in to his eternal kingdom. They had lived long and happily, and died on the same day.~

-REPLACE ~keldr04~ ~After he said goodbye to the woman he loved, Keldorn returned to the Order of the Radiant Heart. Though evil tongues had spoken that he was unworthy to be a paladin because he had accepted Bhaal's blood, nevertheless Keldorn had replaced Wessalen at his post as the prelate for the Order. He lived in the barracks of the Order and he never stepped foot near the old house again. <CHARNAME> was visiting him and squires were questioning themselves, why do they sometimes hear a quiet woman's voice, laughing and crying, coming from the prelate's room. But nobody ever dared to speak of it, so Keldorn's reputation was never questioned. <CHARNAME> really was visiting him and telling him what was happening up there. Keldorn seemed revived after these visits, so much so, that this was fueling many rumors and gossips. There still were battles across Faerun and Keldorn took part in them. But he always managed to come out just slightly wounded or merely scratched. <CHARNAME> was always protecting him, though prolong his life she couldn't.
-
-In the meantime, Keldorn had decided to clean Athkatla from all thieves and slavers. And he succeeded! Many influential persons have lost their places because they were supporting the slavers. Once Keldorn returned to his bachelor apartment from the courtroom and suddenly felt himself very ill. <CHARNAME> appeared by his side, her hand holding Keldorn's in his death hour. Even Torm himself has come to follow his loyal servant to his grave. Squires and knights of the Order of Radiant Heart for the rest of their lives remembered the appearance of Torm. A giant figure, clad in golden armor, holding a figure of a prelate in his hand and the goddess of dazzling beauty was standing nearby with tears of pearl falling from her eyes. Keldorn was given the right to leave Torm's plane in order to meet with his only love, the daughter of Bhaal.~

He felt that his life changed; that he could not remain what he was before. <CHARNAME> and her husband became for him the only close people and Sarevok spent much time with them. When Gorion was born, Sarevok felt that time has come to return his debt and atone for the murder of his sister's stepfather. The boy grew bold and strong and he was getting close to his uncle more and more as if he was feeling an approach of the parting with his parents and sister. Sarevok trained him, and when Gorion grew up, managed to persuade <CHARNAME> to let the boy go with him to Kara-Tur, so he could learn the art of the sword from real masters. <CHARNAME> knew that the boy would become lone soon and became happy at this opportunity. She gave her son the Celestial Fury (which excited the boy much), told him to listen to his uncle and bid her farewell. Keldorn was hard at making this decision, but he understood that his son would be better off together with Sarevok than alone in the vast Castle Firecam. Neither Sarevok, nor Gorion Firecam were seen in Fae'run since.~

They serve to Kelemvor by helping mortals to deal with their fears of death and existence after the fact. In order to help combat these fears, many of which are tied to the works of necromancers, doomguides also serve as elite divine spellcasters who seek out necromancers and their undead servitors to destroy them and bring a measure of peace to the world. To doomguides and their god there is no greater abomination than the undead, and doomguides train throughout their careers to free these souls and send them on their way to the City of Judgment. To aid them Kelemvor grants his priests some measure of his power and grace, instilling doomguides with a power over death that fills the undead and their masters with fear.
-
-Doomguides wearing their chain mail armor are extremely potent in their ability to smite undead. The armor grants a more powerful version of turn undead, which causes undead to burn in a hot flash of light. Another ability the doomguides get from their armor is known as "Ethereal Purge", which creates a sphere within which ethereal creatures are forced onto the Prime Material Plane. In a strange occurrence due to Kelemvor's favor, doomguides are exceptional healers, even compared with typical clerics. The third ability which their chain mail grants them is to clean off deathly effects that affect the body or mind.

-  SAY DESC ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.
-
-With the addition of the fifth and final head to this weapon created by the evil Rakshasa race the true potential of the Flail of Ages is finally realized.

You were about to sigh and pronounce your thanks that at least it was not frog-turning, and request refund from the sly sailor. Suddenly the crew became agitated, everyone pointing to the east. You turned and saw a gray cloud speeding across the sky straight for the "Gallante". A few of the crewmen leaped overboard. Someone behind your back whispered: "that’s how the fate looks?" and spat heartily on the deck. Then the world became one great gray fog and all you could sense is the movement of tremendous speed... But you could not distinguish the direction or count the time... Slowly you had lost your consciousness... and regained it in what seemed a short instant. The ship is riding shallow waters in a sheltered bay by a stony beach. Captain Havarian approaches you hesitantly...~ [theme3]

Remembering the man that he had once been, fleeing his history into the deepest woods of Amn, the ranger would be thankful that <CHARNAME> had entered his life and forever wish his old friend well.~

Valygar traveled with <CHARNAME>, and one day their road led to a village in Zakhara. Much to Valygar’s surprise, he found that he had large family there, not a single member of which was Tainted with Corthala curse. Abyssina’s son and <CHARNAME> received a warm welcome and before they knew it the whole village turned into a carnival celebrating their marriage.

Unknown to her lovers, she would place a Ring of Readiness on the morning star, saving the matching ring for a special time.

-	SAY DESC ~A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faerun.  A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart.  Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings.  He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle.  In the lands north of Baldur’s Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm.  Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan’s.  Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan’s home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead.  His farm was burned to the ground.  Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood.  He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with.  Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan’s death, it was blessed by a god.  Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal.  Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan’s actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

Shimmering runes have been etched the entire length of the blade. When examined closely, the runes writhe with a life of their own. Not much is known about origins of this sword. Kachiko said that this sword is her favoured weapon, and it had been granted to her by Bamboo Spirit folk who lives in southern forests of Kozakura.

Niri Alud was a conjurer from Tethyr who loved playing chess.  He frequently traveled with chess sets on his numerous voyages.  He wanted the ability to summon allies at a moment’s notice without giving away his intention.  For that reason, he created a wide variety of chess sets of different colors that would summon constructed, golem-like automatons to aid him in battle.  Almost all of Niri Alud’s chess sets were lost when he was attacked by desert raiders in Calimshan.  The raiders, ignorant of the ways of magic, let most of the chess sets sink into the desert sands.  The chess sets that were taken were soon separated, pieces traveling through trade and theft over hundreds of miles.  Treasure hunters search for the pieces still.

-	SAY NAME2 ~Selune's Promise~
-	SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune’s Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora’s luck could not stay with them forever, though.
-
-In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa’s allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa’s former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.
-
-Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.
-
-Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime’s mother.

Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away. This ivory-headed mace was the result. The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory. Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place. The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace. It is carved from pure ivory and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon. The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.
-
-Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace. It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater. The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold. Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest. Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

-  SAY 0x1CC ~When asked about his past, MINSC proudly announces that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the utter east. He is currently undertaking his dejemma, a ritual journey to manhood, and is seeking adventure and glory in battle. It is also his honor to be the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rashemen named Dynaheir, and if anyone tries to harm her he will beat sense into their heads until they reconsider. He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon return to their homeland. So far Minsc considers his most notable experience in the world abroad to be the acquisition of his animal companion 'Boo,' a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. He seems a good-natured fellow, but is all too willing to indulge his berserker nature.~

He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon return to their homeland.

-BEGIN ~Improved Monk Class (by Vlad)~
-
-STRING_SET 45867 ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own. They channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.  
-
-Monks must be of Lawful alignments.
-
-Combat Abilities:
--  The monk can make 1 unarmed attack per round; he gains 1/2 an  additional attack every 3 levels.
--  Stunning blow, once per day for every 4 levels.  All attacks in the next 6 seconds force the victim to save or be stunned. NOTE: this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
--  Monks can cause 10% cumulative spell failure penalty applied for each successful hit on a spellcaster.
--  As the monk increases in levels, the damage his fists inflicts does as well:
- Level 1-2:   1-6
- Level 3-5:   1-8
- Level 6-8:   1-10
- Level 9-14:  1-12 
- Level 15+:   1-20 
-
-Special Abilities:
--  A monk's natural armor class gets better as he goes up in levels. His armor class starts off at 9, and then decreases by 1 for every 2 levels.
--  Deflect Missiles (this ability gives a monk a -1 to their armour class vs missiles for every 3 levels).
--  The monk gains a +2 to save vs spells
--  A monk starts off moving at +2 move, then +1 move every 5 levels.
-
-Monk's special abilities according to levels:
- Level 5:    Immunity to all diseases. Immunity to slowing and hasting effects.
- Level 7:    Lay on Hands to heal 2 hit points per level
- Level 8:    -1 to speed factor
- Level 9:    +1 to all saves. Immunity to charm. Fist become considered +1 weapons.
- Level 11:  Immunity to poison
- Level 12:  Another -1 to speed factor. Fists become considered +2 weapons. 
- Level 13:  Quivering palm spell once per day. This spell gives them one hand attack. If they hit an opponent, the opponent must save or die. NOTE: this special ability automatically modifies a Monk's normal attack, no targeting needs to be done.
- Level 15:  Fists are considered +3 weapons
- Level 20:  Immunity to non-magical weapons
-
-Magic Resistance:
- Level 14:    +42% (a special one-time bonus)
- Level 15-31: +3% per level until 100% maximum
-
-Innate Abilities:                                           
--  Invoke Courage once per day per 4 levels                 
--  Heal once per day per 4 levels                           
--  Death Curse once per day (at level 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36)

-SAY ~FIREWALKER: This fighter kit was especially created for Shar-Teel to reflect her unique personality. Being a naturally born fighter of immense power she has developed her extraordinary innate abilities to ignite matter inherited from her father Angelo Dossan. Spending much time on attempts to control created fire she learnt a lot on magic nature of the fire element and gained additional fire resistance bonuses to prevent possible burning into own flames. Such extensive studies of magick significantly raised her intelligence.
+SAY @20511
 
-Advantages:
--  She gains +1 to hit, and +1 to damage for every four levels of experience starting from the 7th level of experience.
--  She gains +1 to intelligence and 10% fire resistance bonus at levels 9, 13, 18, 23 and 27.
--  She has access to several innate abilities, which become available from her innate slots as she advances levels:
-  1. Fireball (at levels 7, 10, 13, 17, 22, and 27)
-  2. Fire Shield (Red) (at levels 7, 10, 13, 17, 22, and 27)
-  3. Sunfire (at levels 10, 12, 15, 19, 22 and 29)
-  4. Delayed Blast Fireball (at levels 11, 15, 19, 24, 28 and 32)
-  5. Incendiary Cloud (at levels 14, 19, 23, 28 and 33)
-
-Disadvantages:
--  She may specialise only in blade weapons (swords, halberds and daggers) except axes.~

-  SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~These round-backed instruments are extremely popular in the Western Heartlands of Faerun, crafted in Calimshan and heard as far north as Sundabar. Lutes are stringed instruments with pear-shaped bodies and fretted fingerboards, frequently played in small courts and common taverns.~
-  SAY DESC ~Pellon Kay would never appear in history books for his musical talents. If it wasn‘t for his famous lute, no one would have remembered him at all. Born in Sembia and raised in a musical family, Pellon Kay never took his performances seriously. Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation. Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon‘s antics, but that Talos found Pellon‘s attitude to be quite amusing. The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon‘s unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn‘t let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute. The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

-  SAY NAME2 ~Viol of the Hollow Men~
-  SAY UNIDENTIFIED_DESC ~Violins are bowed stringed instruments having four strings, a shallow body, shoulders at right angles to the neck, a fingerboard without frets, and a curved bridge.  They are typically played by pulling a bow across the strings, but can also be plucked.  Elves are particularly fond of violins and their craftsmen produce some of the finest specimens in the world.~
-  SAY DESC ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow‘s Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck.  Nikolai was born in The Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler.  Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures.  One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver.  Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area.  Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world.  Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant.  In spite of Nikolai‘s shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.
-
-After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast.  Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolate peaks of his mountain birthplace.  He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances.  Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon.  When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.
-
-Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men.  He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity.  Tremble assaulted Nikolai‘s pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he‘d be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence.  Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves.  Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai‘s father and stabbed him in the heart.  When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.
-
-Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai‘s dead father and said, "Where‘s your big mouth now, fiddle player?"  Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before, and no one in Faerun would ever hear again.  Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor.  Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn‘t think were possible.  At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers.  The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims.  Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.
-
-Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

-
-I am not a man of words and could never speak the truth of what is in my heart. So I have written what my heart feels in the following words. Read them my dearest and know they are for you alone.
-
-Once I was lonely and had no aim in life,
-I had no future, and no need of a wife,
-I had no dreams and no longings to fulfil,
-But God only knows I don‘t feel that way still.
-
-All that it took was a touch from a butterfly,
-The most tender of creatures, for which I would die,
-All that it took was a voice so gentle and sweet
-To make me put my heart right there at her feet.
-
-So now in my life I have but one goal,
-To give her my heart, to give her my soul,
-To share with her forever,yes forever as one,
-To hold her heart high in the warmth of the sun.
-
-Till eternity comes and forever beyond,
-Nothing can break our loves tender bond,
-Nothing can take my heart from her side,
-NOTHING can stop me from making her my bride.
-
-Yes it is love that sustains me, every day of my life,
-It is love that has brought me to wanting her as my wife,
-It is love that forever is beating in my heart,
-It is that will assure that we never shall part.
-
-I go down on my knees and so humbly I plea,
-If she‘ll grant me my wish, if she‘ll make my dreams be
-All that I long for, if she‘ll give me her hand, 
-Will she make me the happiest man in the land?
-
-So Leina, dearest heart, what will be your answer? Will you make me the happiest man in the land and honour me by becoming my wife? 
-
-My heart remains yours forever.

-  SAY DESC ~The pendant Leina carries, rather than wears, at the moment once belonged to her father. The single blood red stone is as clear as crystal and when you look at it closely you would swear you could see an image reflected in it if only you could focus your eye on it. This pendant is in fact one of a pair, the red stones symbols the blood bond of the wearers. One was given to each of her parents by her elven grandmother, the sorceress Leolwyn on their marriage. Leolwyn based the pendants on the work of the elven mage Azurel in as much as the pendants, when worn by a paired couple, each will instantly know when the other is mentally or physically impaired. The pendant will also give the wearer a clear and precise picture of where the afflicted person is, enabling the other to move directly to them regardless of distance. Leolwyn‘s modifications include innate abilities that would occur if the pendants were brought together on the death of one of the paired couple, affording protection and aid for the surviving partner.
-  
-Leina‘s father had his pendant attuned to Leina and gave it to her on her marriage so‘s her mother would know if misfortune ever befell their daughter when she left Athkatla. Leina, however never wore hers once her husband deserted her. Due to her pride, she did not want her parents to know of her plight. She therefore never knew of her mother‘s death until she returned to Athkatla.

-To enchant a katana is no simple process.  Unlike conventional weapons, the katana is already a near-perfect fighting sword.  To improve it usually requires a sacrifice, perhaps a dying samurai might beg a Wu Jen to infuse his fighting spirit into the spirit of the katana.

Not doing so could drastically change one's luck for the worse.

It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one. One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly red ones.

She received this powerful weapon after completing a series of succesful missions for the emperor, who decided she was worthy of the blade. It was made by the emperors best weapon smiths, and then tempered in the bloods of red, black, silver and blue dragons. The legend says this weapon would make anyone almost as good as thief as the original owner, but because of the strong enchantments, the katana requires much from its wielder, and it is only usable by a thief.

+SAY @20721
     
-SAY ~WILWANDERER OF BAERVAN: This cleric kit was especially created for Aerie to reflect her unique personality.
-
-Baervan Wildwanderer (BAY-ur-van WILD-WAN-der-er) is the god of forest-dwelling gnomes and their communities, travel, and the outdoors. He loves oak trees and all forest animals and is guardian of the wild. Baervan gifted forest gnomes with the ability to communicate with forest animals, and taught them to how to hide in and move through wooded environments without being detected. The Masked Leaf is the patron god of forest gnomes, but he is well loved by all of the gnome subraces. He is even revered by the svirfneblin as the Father of Fish and Fungus. Baervan is worshiped by those who love the woodlands, as well as many wanderers, thieves, fighter/thieves, and fighters, particularly those who prefer living in the outdoors rather than in a city all the time.
-
-Baervan's friend and constant companion in his escapades is a giant raccoon named Chiktikka Fastpaws, who is highly intelligent but prone to act before he thinks. Many stories are told of the adventures that this duo has shared, often started by Chiktikka's humorous ability to get into trouble by borrowing something valuable, such as a minor artifact. Baervan is closely allied with the other gods of the gnome pantheon, with the notable exception of Urdlen. He works closely with Segojan Earthcaller, for both gods are concerned with the natural world.
-
-Traditionally, their portfolios are divided between caring for forest animals and plants for Baervan, and burrowing animals for Segojan. Baervan sometimes accompanies Garl, or even Baravar, on their mischievous escapades, and the trio's shared interest in mischief embodies and encourages this aspect of the gnome psyche. Baervan's carefree nature and penchant for jests strains the patience of Gaerdal Ironhand, albeit not to the extent that the pranks of Baravar Cloakshadow do. Baervan is closely allied with many of the sylvan powers of the Seelie Court. His passion for oak trees has led to his endless, if so far fruitless, pursuit of Verenestra's affections. The Masked Leaf is a frequent participant in the councils of Emmantiensien, Rillifane Rallathil, and Silvanus, though he rarely has the patience to sit through an entire discussion with these slow-speaking woodland giants. Baervan has few foes aside from Urdlen, although the Beastlord has earned his ire for hunting forest gnomes under the Masked Leaf's protection.
-
-Baervan is gentle, good-natured, and mischievous. His penchant for good-natured pranks rivals Garl Glittergold. Except for Chiktikka's company, he tends to keep to himself. Though Baervan sometimes plays jokes on others, it is hard not to like him. The Masked Leaf's tricks are often designed to serve some purpose, unlike the mischief typical of Forgotten Folk. If Baervan wants to send someone a message, he does so in the form of a joke. Baervan dispatches avatars to help repair severe damage to nature, though sometimes just to create mischief.
-
-The Masked Leaf may manifest as an amber radiance to settle over a worshiper or any type of plant. This manifestation can confer upon a favored worshiper the benefits of a spell such as 'barkskin', locate plants and animals, pass without trace, plant door, speak with plants, or tree or coalesce into a handful of goodberries. Baervan’s manifestation can animate a tree as a treant for up to seven rounds, create a spike growth effect, or act as combined entangle and plant growth spells.
-
-Baervan is served by forest animals of all types (particularly raccoons and giant raccoons), amber dragons, dryads, earth elementals, faerie dragons, feystags, hamadryads, hybsils, leprechauns, nature elementals, singing trees, sprites, swanmays, treants, wild stags, and wood giants. He demonstrates his favor by permitting his faithful to discover acorns, pieces of amber, emeralds, oak leaves or the sudden growth of plants on a welltrodden trail where such would seem out of place. The Masked Leaf indicates his displeasure by causing a tree branch to gently strike the target of his disaffection or by causing small animals to behave oddly (like pelting a gnome with acorns).
-
-The church of the Masked Leaf is well regarded among most gnome communities, particularly forest gnomes, for Baervan and his followers are a likable bunch. Baervan's penchant for getting into trouble has long been a source of amusement and pride for the Forgotten Folk, and they generally embrace his mischievous nature as portrayed in the behavior of his clergy. Among other races, the church of Baervan is little known save among other elven and sylvan deities. The Fair Folk, particularly the Sy-Tel'Ques-sir, view the cult of the forest gnomes with great affection, as they do the followers of the Seelie Court.
-
-Baervan's worshipers assemble in forest clearings to venerate their god, preferably sylvan glades ringed by a circle of ancient oaks, although such arboreal menhirs are not required. Longstanding shrines of the Masked Leaf are transformed into woodland chapels with the circle of broad trunks growing closer together and the canopy of intertwined limbs and leaves forming a natural roof.
-
-Novices of Baervan are known as Acorns. Full priests of the Masked Leaf are known as Wildwanderers.
-               
-Advantages:
--  Wildwanderers of Baervan have an exceptional dexterity
--  They can specialise in any weapon that a cleric can use
--  Wildwanderers have a natural mind shield embedded in one of their personal items, i.e. they cannot be charmed, confused or affected by any mind-altering effects including pisonics
--  They can cast a limited number of spells relating to their forest and animal loving nature, which become available from their innate slots as they advance levels:
- At 2nd, 4th and 6th level, wildwanderers can cast Barkskin, Entangle and Baervan's Bilberries
- At 3rd, 5th and 8th level, wildwanderers can cast Charm Person or Mammal, Hold Animal and Zone of Sweet Air
- At 7th, 9th and 11th level, wildwanderers can cast Summon Insects, Call Woodland Beings and Animal Summoning I
- At 10th, 12th and 14th level, wildwanderers can cast Cloak of Fear and Animal Summoning II
- At 13th, 16th and 18th level, wildwanderers can cast Pixie Dust, Insect Plague and Animal Summoning III
- At 17th, 19th and 21st level, wildwanderers can cast Conjure Animals, Conjure Fire Elemental and Fire Seeds
- At 20th, 23rd and 26th level, wildwanderers can cast Conjure Earth Elemental, Confusion and Creeping Doom
- At 22nd, 25th and 28th level, wildwanderers can cast Elemental Summoning and Greater Elemental Summoning
-
-At level 15, Wildwanderers of Baervan receive a Holy Symbol of Baervan.

-SAY ~RED WIZARD OF THAY: The Red Wizards are the masters of Thay, the conquerors of that land's native Rashemi, and the would-be magical overlords of Faerun. They focus on a school of magic more intently than any specialist, achieving incredible mastery of magic within a very narrow focus. Seen as cruel and evil tyrants by people across Toril, a few choose to leave their region, assume secret identities, and practice magic without having to worry about political alliances and possible slave uprisings.
-
-The Red Wizards at their height were the enemies of many forces in Toril and received support from demons, devils, and drow. Amongst those who opposed them were the Witches of Rashemen, the Seven Sisters and their allies, the goodly Harpers, and even the Zhentarim, who disliked the Wizards encroaching on their territory.
-
-After another failed attempt at securing Rashemen in 1357 DR, the Red Wizards planned to infiltrate the nations of Faerun legitimately — in Thayan enclaves which would publicly sell magic items and quietly also traffic drugs, wicked spells, and slaves. Using these they hoped to eventually have strongholds and resulting political infiltration that would make them indispensable and powerful, and eventually get them something along the lines of world domination.
-
-Despite the general distrust and dislike that most felt towards the Red Wizards, the mages were still able to extend their power to almost every corner of the Realms, running their enclaves as planned in towns where slaving was otherwise banned. From here they ran a lucrative business in the trade of magical items, spells and artifacts, making them virtually indispensable to many of their clients, and as such the wizards expanded their sphere of influence ever further.
-
-The final blow to the Red Wizards as they once stood came when the last remaining zulkirs, decades later, interrupted Szass Tam's plot to become a being of godlike power, preventing his ritual from reaching completion. Their efforts cost them their lives but likely saved Faerun from one of the greatest threats it might have ever faced and prevented Szass Tam from ever attempting the ritual again - at least so long as it was conducted on Thayan soil. For the Red Wizards however, the death of the zulkirs ended what the Red Wizards once had been and gave way for the new order.
-
-The Red Wizards in the end transformed their old enclaves into their homes. What had once been a facade of a purpose, the accumulation of profit through selling magical items, became fact as the Red Wizards' goals transformed entirely. By 1479 DR few individuals associated the name "Red Wizard" with Thay but instead with a loose confederacy of merchant arcanists and those who believed otherwise were, in fact, mistaken.
-
-Many traditions of the old Red Wizards were lost in the transformation and modern Red Wizards don't maintain the same Mulani traditions of shaved heads and tattoos that the old organization did. Most of the Red Wizards are actual wizards, but not all are, and the title of Red Wizard is generally inherited from parent to child, with exceptions in the case of adoption or marriage whereas in the past the Red Wizards were recruited from talented wizards. Red Wizard enclaves are essentially self-run, some by a single individual, others by a small council of wizards. Most of these enclaves are found within the lands bordering the Sea of Fallen Stars and those nations where Red Wizards are found almost certainly have an enclave within their capital city.
-
-Advantages:
--  As many other Red Wizards, Edwin can specialise in any weapon that a mage can use.
--  In addition to spells Edwin learns, he can cast a limited number of conjuration/summoning spells, which become available from his innate slots as he advances levels:
- At 12th, 15th and 19th level, Edwin can cast Power Words of Silence, Stun and Blind

+SAY @20739
     
-SAY ~DARKCLOAK OF SHAR: This cleric kit was especially created for Viconia to reflect her unique personality.
-
-Shar, also known as Mistress of the Night, Nightsinger, Lady of Loss, or The Darkness, is the evil counterpart to her twin sister Selune, and presides over caverns, dark, dungeons, forgetfulness, loss, night, secrets, and the Underdark. Shar is an ancient goddess, formed together with her sister at the beginning of time, out of the empty nothingness that existed before gods or mortals. Among her array of twisted powers is the ability to see everything that lies or happens in the dark.
-
-Since her earliest battles with Selune (which continue to this day), Shar has gained dominion over pain hidden but not forgotten, carefully nurtured bitterness, and quiet revenge for old slights. Deeply twisted, the Lady of Loss favors secrets, underhanded dealings, and subterfuge. She uses her mortal worshipers as pawns in a perverse game against everything that has been, is, and will be. Patron of the Shadow Weave, a corrupting magical force based upon nothingness and mad secrets, the Mistress of the Night bolsters her impressive power with temptation and guile.
-
-The clergy of the Church of Shar use corruption and subversion to spread Shar's faith, but they must do this in secret in many places due to the religion being forbidden. The atmosphere of the organization is one of unwavering faith to its leader, Shar herself. Disobeying an order usually results in death. Although devotees are perfectly willing to give their life for Shar, she often does not intend for this to happen because it will deplete the number of her dedicated followers.
-
-From time to time, Shar requests of her priests that a certain individual, usually a sorcerer or wizard who she deems to have misused the Shadow Weave, is killed. On the other hand, Shar can forbid such acts against specific individuals. It is not uncommon for the church to make use of the Shadow Weave itself, although Shar holds onto the deepest and most powerful secrets of the magical force.
-
-The clergy of the church will travel in small groups or individually throughout Faerun, often disguised as merchants or pilgrims to avoid detection. Their missions usually involve either espionage or murder.
-
-The church is split into individual cells that can operate independently from one another, often having a temple or shrine as their focal point. Cells are linked by the leadership of a priest, and one priest will typically control the cells in a geographic area. Priests communicate with one another, but rarely reveal truthful information to their inferiors.
-
-The intent of the Church of Shar is to spread the faith of Shar. This is achieved by undermining and corrupting individuals, governments and even other religions. This enables the subject to be more likely to accept the views and dogma of Shar. Because the most valuable commodity to the clergy of Shar is a secret, information is closely guarded and is only revealed when it is essential to be known. The clergy of Shar will expect that a secret is traded for another similarly prized secret.
-
-By revealing secrets, Sharran clergy will attempt to incite bitterness and jealously within individual, such as telling a woman that her husband is having an affair. These emotions are strongly embraced by Shar and highly increase the likeliness of a successful conversion.
-
-There are several orders in the Church of Shar: the Dark Justicars who have to kill a priest of Selune to gain admittance to the order, the Servants of the Dark Moon who tap into the Shadow Weave through their powers of sorcery, and the "Nightbringers", the elite Sharran forces.
-
-Unusual among other orders in the Church, the "Darkcloaks" were actually a compassionate group of oracles and caregivers who tended to those troubled souls who were emotionally damaged, often bringing the bliss of forgetfulness to soothe their pain. Their work did much to present the church in a positive light to the populace, though too often the reaction was still negative. This order included some of the few non-evil clerics in the Church, and Viconia is one of them.
-               
-Advantages:
--  They can specialise in any weapon that a cleric can use
--  Darkcloaks have a negative plane protection and a natural mind shield, both embedded in one of their personal items, i.e. they cannot be level or energy drained and they cannot be charmed, confused or affected by any mind-altering effects including pisonics
--  They can cast a limited number of spells, which become available from their innate slots as they advance levels:
- At 2nd, 4th and 6th level, darkcloaks can cast Cure Disease, Neutralize Poison and Remove Paralysis
- At 3rd, 5th and 8th level, darkcloaks can cast Iron Skins, Lesser Restoration and Death Ward
- At 7th, 9th and 11th level, darkcloaks can cast Cause Serious Wounds, Cause Critical Wounds and Slay Living

-Carsomyr is a weapon of legend, perhaps one of the most powerful blades ever forged on Faerun, though its origin and history is thought purposefully forgotten, such that the sword itself never overshadow the importance of the struggles that must be fought today.  It is infused with the very essence of virtue, and requires as much from any paladin that would hope to wield it.  The evils of the Realms must truly stand aside when this weapon is brought to bear, their magic dispelled with a word, steadfastly resisted with ease.  Carsomyr also harbors a special distaste for the forces of evil and chaos, and such creatures must fear additional damage from its touch in battle. 
-
-This enhanced Carsomyr was forged by Cromwell by combining the original Lilarcor with the powerful Carsomyr that only paladins could use. The enhanced Carsomyr is made even greater than the original Carsomyr and may be used by any fighting class.

-  SAY NAME2 ~Selune's Promise +5~
-  SAY DESC ~A weapon once owned by a grief-stricken high priestess of the Moonmaiden, Selune’s Promise has a short and sad history. Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selunite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead creatures wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora’s luck could not stay with them forever, though.
-
-In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful spectres and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa’s allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa’s former companions had been turned into slave spectres under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master spectre and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren.  In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.
-
-Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selune that she never forget the agony of that night. Selune granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the club were two words: Never Forget.
-
-Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selune in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided to bestow this unique weapon to a new promising priestess. This mace was the favourite weapon of Sime’s mother.
-
-It turns to be that Cromwell inherited the secret knowledge from his ancestors of rithelium weapons and how to forge them. This mace that he reforged with rithelium and with your assistance is extremely light and gives off a shimmering blue hue. It is usable by wizards as if proficient in their use, grants magical resistance to the wearer and can strike through magical defences of the enemies.

Delgam eschewed imbuing his items with offensive powers or other miscellaneous magic effects. Instead, he focused on what abjurers tend to focus on: defense. His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well known legacy.

The number of men, women, and children Apali killed with the aid of the bow is almost unbelievable, as the soldier waged war against humans for hundreds of years before he was finally laid low in Chessenta by a priest of Assuran, god of vengeance. Apali had killed the priest‘s great-great grandfather in Chult over a hundred years earlier. The item is easily recognized because of the red and black banding on the grip and the carved snake heads at the ends of the bow. The red and black bandings represent Apali‘s family, from a caste of priests. The snake heads represent Sseth, the god of the yuan-ti.

-This is the true name that the dwarven weaponsmith, Silverblade, gave to the weapon he intended to create for his son.  Alas, his son died before the weapon was ever completed, but here it stands complete... forged from the combined magic of the original hammer with the Gauntlets of Ogre Power and a Girdle of Frost Giant Strength.  Crom Faeyr gifts its users with all the powers of the original Hammer of Thunderbolts, in addition to enormous strength and the ability to kill golems, ettins and trolls in one blow.

-  SAY DESC ~This robe was fashioned from strong fabric and dyed dark blue, the favorite color of its proud owner, the archmage Ogi-Luc. A Sembian by birth, Ogi-Luc was a powerful man, as strong in body as he was in mind. However, Ogi-Luc wasn't content to merely be strong. He wanted to be exceptionally strong. When he put on this robe, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim. Nesk took the robe as a prize. It were later stolen and sold by a daring rogue.

-  SAY DESC ~Flame Tongue +4 (Enhanced by Cromwell)
-
-There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself- but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

-Combined with the Hell Bane sword, this weapon is also the bane of certain lower planes creatures and vampires. Against Baatezu and Tanar‘ri the sword inflicts additional damage and the user gains a +4 to both hit and damage. As for vampires, the sword has a chance to slain them on touch. While held, the sword also grants complete protection against poison, disease and fire being magical or not.

Because of these properties it is much sought after, but finding, let alone slaying, a powerful ancient dragon is nearly impossible. It is usually easier to search for an existing suit, such as this one. One should be careful wearing it near dragons, however, particularly crimson ones.
