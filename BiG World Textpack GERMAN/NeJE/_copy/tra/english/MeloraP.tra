@0    = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. What brings you back to this area? Were you looking for me?~ [melorl04]
@1    = ~I am indeed looking for you, Melora. I have missed you and have returned to seek your help again, if you are willing to aid me that is.~
@2    = ~No, just passing by.~
@3    = ~Does this mean you no longer have use of my skills, <CHARNAME>? Should we not continue on your task?~ [melorl01]
@4    = ~I did not mean for you to leave, Melora, your skills are still greatly needed as are you.~
@5    = ~It does, Melora, but perhaps only for the time being. Will I be able to find you here if I should pass this way and have a need of your skills again?~
@6    = ~It pleases me to hear you say this, <CHARNAME>, it would have saddened me to leave without completing your task.~ [melorl03]
@7    = ~I cannot remain here as it isn't safe for me to do so, <CHARNAME>. This place is strange and frightening. I will try to find my way then. Goodbye and may good fortune always follow you on your way.~
@8    = ~I will remain in Athkatla for as long as it is safe for me to do so <CHARNAME>. If you should return, look for me in a small tavern near the city gate. Goodbye and may good fortune always follow you on your way my friend.~ [melorl02]
@9    = ~You, <CHARNAME>, are everything that I have come to despise and swore to fight  against. Your treatment of those less fortunate appals me. I fear that if I remain in your company for very much longer both my name and reputation will suffer.~ [melorl09]
@10   = ~So running out on me are you, Melora? Well maybe my purse will be the fatter for it. Ha, you thought I had not noticed the coin going missing? I imagine you have quite a cache hidden somewhere, just waiting to be given away to those peasants that you love so much. I say, enjoy it while you can Melora, who is to say when the next bounty hunter will catch up with you. I wish you luck, Melora, you will need it!~
@11   = ~What reputation, Melora? You are no more than a common thief who tries to hide her activities under the guise of a do gooder, helping the oppressed you call it, eh, Melora? Your reputation, as you like to call it, only exists among those peasants you say you are helping. Out on your own, I say that it will not be long before one of those bounty hunters eventually catches up with you. I wish you luck, Melora, you will need it! ~
@12   = ~I would rather take my chances with the bounty hunters than spend another day with you. I bid you farewell, <CHARNAME>, and ask that you keep your distance in the future.~ [melorl10]
@13   = ~Then come back when you can. I will wait if you are sure to return.~
@14   = ~I am more than happy to join once more with you my friend. I find myself with the need to leave rather hastily so your words are welcome to my ears.~ [melorl05]
@15   = ~You have sought me out again, <CHARNAME>. Have you amended your ways and require my skills again?~ [melorl06]
@16   = ~I am as I was when we parted company, Melora. I have seen no reason to change. I have come to see if you have changed your mind and are willing to put your skills once more to my use?~
@17   = ~I will try to temper my ways, Melora, but I make no promises will you not try to work with me again?~
@18   = ~I say no, <CHARNAME>. I will not go back on the oath I swore to help those less fortunate. If I were to follow your path, then I would not be true to myself. Please, I would thank you to keep your distance from now on!~ [melorl07]
@19   = ~I will give you one more chance and work with you <CHARNAME>, but if at any time I see any of your evil ways then I will leave permantly, and this is a promise! Come we should make a start.~ [melorl08]
