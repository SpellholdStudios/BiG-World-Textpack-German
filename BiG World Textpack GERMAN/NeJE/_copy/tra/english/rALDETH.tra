@0    = ~Salutations, my dear fellows.  It has been some time since I've seen you last.  Troubled times have descended upon our beautiful city, perhaps we should retire to the antechamber and discuss things.~
@1    = ~Sorry, we don't have time to talk right now, we'll see you later.~
@2    = ~Sounds good to us.~
