@2    = ~Does it matter for our partnership?~
@3    = ~Hmm, can't you feel his essence in me?~
@4    = ~I... did not choose my parents, sir Keldorn, and Gorion did not tell me anything. I thought him to be my real father. Believe me, it was only after reading the letter I discovered after his death that revealed my true parentage and now I would be glad to be rid of this ‘gift'!~
@5    = ~No... not at all my lady. I just thought to clarify the truth that is all. Tell me, what are your plans now?~
@6    = ~Really I haven't got a clue. All I know is that I need to raise enough gold to pay for Imoen's rescue.~
@7    = ~Really I haven't got a clue. All I know is that I was requested to raise a hefty amount of gold to pay for Imoen's rescue, but the contact is dead now.~
@8    = ~Finding opportunities to earn some gold mostly. I was promised some help in finding Imoen, but help does not come free.~
@9    = ~We must find Imoen, of course. In the meantime, I hired a group of people who promised to help me, but not only that they took fifteen thousands gold from me, I still have to perform a lot of errands for them before for their promise to find my friend!~
@10   = ~How much gold are we speaking of here?~
@11   = ~Twenty thousand.~
@12   = ~That is quite a sum my lady! Be assured, you have my aid for as long as it is needed.~
@13   = ~I became acquainted with sir Keldorn Firecam, whom I knew from the tales of my good friend Ajantis. He agreed to accompany me without any hesitation even knowing about my heritage.

@20   = ~My lady... I am but a humble paladin, I can sense evil that is true, but I do not sense evil within you. Now, if I may ask, where is our next destination to be?~
@21   = ~I do believe you... now, what is your next move?~
@22   = ~That's a lot of gold my lady... where did the offer come from?~
@23   = ~I don't know. But I suspect that it involves some thieves. I have had some experience of dealing with them.~
@24   = ~Thieves... (Sighs) I'm sorry, my lady, but I can not associate myself with thieves. We must find another way to save your friend and we will find it, I'm sure. I promised you my aid my lady, and I will make good on my word.~

@26   = ~<CHARNAME>, I... Let us sit here awhile, I must think the things through...~
@27   = ~Sir Keldorn, if you'd like to return home – and I think that Sir William has convinced you to, I would release you from my service. I can't let your family be destroyed because of me.~
@28   = ~If you'd like to stay home – please, do so. I will find a replacement for you; not a companion as valuable as you are, but a replacement nonetheless.~
@29   = ~(Decisively) Sir Keldorn, I should not say this, but... (Take a deep breath in...) I don't believe Sir William.~
@30   = ~Oh sir, you must be broken-hearted!~
@31   = ~(Makes a dismissive gesture) It's already destroyed. After what I have heard today I'll not be able to look upon her in the same way again. I cannot do anything on that account.~
@32   = ~(Bitterly) The whole of Athkatla knows that I have been cuckolded. No, reconciliation is impossible. There is no more to be said. Let us be on our way.~
@33   = ~We have visited sir Keldorn's Estate where I witnessed a confrontation between Keldorn and his wife (Oh God, what a beauty she is!) My faithful paladin was terribly distraught, it seemed to me that tears had been shed, on his part, for a love gone wrong. He seemed to be so sure of his wife. It was a sad, sad thing to see. He loves his wife and daughters so much, and they don't seem to have any affection for him at all. My heart felt for poor sir Keldorn!~
@34   = ~I did not say that, <CHARNAME>, so it is up to you to decide if you require my services or not.~
@35   = ~(He looks into your eyes for a long moment and then asks softly) Why do you say this?~
@36   = ~I don't think he would have told you otherwise. He... he is no warrior, sir, and he was afraid that you could challenge him to a duel. But, don't listen to me, sir, I have no experience in such matters.~
@37   = ~I wouldn't say that you are far off the mark. Let us go forthwith.~
@38   = ~(Shoots a quick glance at you) Let us go.~
@39   = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd like to speak with you. I apologize if this comes as an unpleasant surprise. Please trust me when I say that it was not easy for me to make this choice.~
@40   = ~I am a man of my word, and I have promised to help you rescue Imoen. It is my own fault, as I should not have placed the burden of decision upon your shoulders. You are young and inexperienced, and do not yet understand, that one should follow the spirit of the law, not what's writ. I am becoming wordy in my dotage, don't you think?~
@41   = ~To summarize, my wife is in jail, and my daughters are left without a guardian. I cannot allow them to be sent to an orphanage while I am still alive. I would like to return home, <CHARNAME>, and I'd like us to part the ways amicably. Would you give me your leave in good faith?~
@42   = ~Besides, I have decided to retire from the Order. Most probably, I will take the girls to Esmeltaran, to my mother's estate. I hope that I will be able to regain their confidence, their trust... their love even. Perhaps we may become a family once again.~
@43   = ~I cannot hold you back, Sir Keldorn. I should have listened to you and trust your experience. You are... (very softly) free. Fare thee well, good sir.~
@44   = ~Very well, I understand... now I understand. I release you from your vow. You are free to go. Be happy as much as you can.~
@45   = ~No. This is an order.~
@46   = ~Sir Keldorn, I can see your dilemma. But you've promised to help me, and I think that you would be in the wrong if you were to break your word to me.~
@47   = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It is most unfortunate that  things have come to pass the way they have. I thought we could become good friends. Farewell. Good luck and take care of yourself, if you will... If you ever happen to pass through Esmeltaran, please stop for a visit. Our castle is located off the town site, at the lakeshore.~
@48   = ~It was a foolish decision to insist on the lawful resolution of the conflict between sir Keldorn and his wife. Now he's left me... For good.~
@49   = ~(Squinting) An order? And since when do you issue my orders, m'lady? Do you think that you outrank me, a Senior Officer of the Order, because you are a daughter of the Lord of Murder? This will not be! Farewell, my lady. It is a pity, that we failed to part in good faith.~
@50   = ~You have the right of it, my lady. Indeed I cannot break my sworn word. Well, let it be as you wish. I shall stay.~
@51   = ~It was a foolish decision to insist on the lawful resolution of the conflict between sir Keldorn and his wife. Despite his desire to return home I insisted that he stayed on. Alas, our friendship has come to an end.~
@52   = ~Yes, I am he. Who is it whom wishes to speak with me?~
@53   = ~(Runs his eyes over the letter) Oh, Torm! No! No! This can not be!~
@54   = ~What... what has happened?~
@55   = ~Your wife has done something again?~
@56   = ~(Pale) My daughters have perished. I... I must go back for.. the funeral.~
@57   = ~I'll go with you!~

@59   = ~Thank you... I am not certain it is needed though.~
@60   = ~Keldorn, I beg you! Allow me to be beside you!~
@61   = ~Have it your way, Keldorn. But I do not think you can manage it all by yourself.~
@62   = ~(Handing you Maria's letter) Here, read this. I do not comprehend everything here, you explain to me later... later.~
@63   = ~I... know nothing.~
@64   = ~Keldorn, please! Allow me to be beside you!~
@65   = ~Wait? My beloved daughters are dead and you ask me to wait to lay them to rest? That is it... I am leaving. You are a steel-hearted creature, <CHARNAME>.~
@66   = ~(Gloomy) Maria? I await explanation... the full story! How could it be that the girls were alone at home?~ [mute]
@67   = ~Some? And where were you? I demand an answer!~
@68   = ~We had enough people for both escorting and guarding the mansion.~
@69   = ~(Tartly) And you what? You took every single one of them?~
@70   = ~Go on.~
@71   = ~(Covers his face with his hands and keeps silence for a very long time... then he pronounces hollowly) What you are saying here is that you left for an assignation with your lover, taking all our guards with you and leaving our daughters helpless... is that not so?~
@72   = ~(Furiously) And where else would you possibly go at such an hour? Decent ladies do not pay calls on a night! I... I contravened the law and not to say my duty when I did not bring you to justice, when I should have!~
@73   = ~Now our precious daughters have paid the price for your folly. You will surely be imprisoned for what you have allowed to come about! I have condoned you and you, if I remember rightly, pledged your love for me... Why? You have never felt even the slightest compassion for me.~
@74   = ~Tell me Maria, why did you agree to marry me? No one was forcing you into this marriage.~
@75   = ~Go on...~
@76   = ~Finally... After so many years I am going to learn the truth.~
@77   = ~He was indeed... I often wonder myself how I managed to slay him with such a wound. <CHARNAME>, remember I was telling you? You have seen the scar on my left side?~
@78   = ~Right, a horrible scar.~
@79   = ~As a matter of fact it is very deep too. I really do not know how I survived.~
@80   = ~Gods did not require you dead, Keldorn. (Put a hand on his shoulder) Let us move along, my friend. You have nothing more to do here.~
@81   = ~Yes, you are right, dear.~
@82   = ~(Angrily) Shut your black mouth, Maria!~
@83   = ~Maria!~ [KELDOR91]
@84   = ~(Furious) You are outwearing my patience, Maria!~
@85   = ~Keldorn, let us move along, I beg you! Let's go and pray for your girls' souls, come now.~
@86   = ~You are right, we must go to the temple. Your thoughtfulness has reminded me what is important here... (Hangs upon your shoulder) Come along.~
@87   = ~Open your eyes woman, I am not hugging her, I'm holding on to her... You are a bitter, selfish woman, Maria, I do not understand how I could have been so blind for so long... Go sue for divorce, I'll agree to any terms. You can keep the house, I wouldn't be able to... stay here anyway.~
@88   = ~Isn't this what you have striven for, why you tried to cause so much mayhem?~
@89   = ~(Glumly) I see... you were hoping that I would kill sir William and as member of the Order, I would face the executioners axe myself... I pity you Maria... petition your divorce, I'll not stand in your way. Come <CHARNAME>, this place holds nothing for me now.~
@90   = ~I thank you, prelate. I... am to blame. I violated the law. I did not bring my wife to justice and I am ready to accept my sentence.~
@91   = ~Prelate...~
@92   = ~That is settled then?~
@93   = ~(Gazes upon the crypt and sighs grievously) I can at least take comfort in the fact that they died my children, and not some bastard's.~
@94   = ~(Coming to himself after sad thoughts) <CHARNAME>, you may find this most strange, but I'd like to pay a visit to lady Bylanna. The more I think about the attack at the mansion, the more convinced I become that it was not haphazard. Trust me, I do not intend revenge, I do not have such thoughts on my mind, but I want to know who did this foul deed and for what reason.~
@95   = ~Keldorn... people are sometimes killed without any reason. Just remember how often we have been attacked in some dark alleys!~
@96   = ~I do not know what to say, honestly. On one hand those responsible were definitely thieves, not mercenaries, on the other hand those thieves were a little too bold. They were not in the least bit perturbed by the fact that your house faced the government mansion or that there were crowds of soldiers in the street.~
@97   = ~Well, looking at the exteriors of the house you would not know if there was anything of great value inside. Perhaps, they counted on lady Maria's jewellery?~
@98   = ~We can, of course, why not? But I think you are exaggerating. Those responsible were just thieves and anything else was just coincidental.~
@99   = ~I am sure you are right my lady... but I need to put away any doubts. Please let us visit Bylanna if we happen to be nearby.~
@100  = ~All right, we'll do that.~
@101  = ~A truer word was never spoken. I too found the story suspicious. Let us go to Bylanna, this will not take up too much of our time.~
@102  = ~They must have been outsiders then. One can hardly disguise anything in this city. Maria possesses one and only one necklace and that she only takes off when she sleeps.  There was once a lot of joking on that account... Back to my request, I still want to ask you to find a way to visit Bylanna.~
@103  = ~All is possible though... I do not know. I beg you, please do me this favour.~
@104  = ~(Keldorn nods his head in silence and sinks deep in his thoughts)~
@105  = ~Lady Bylanna, I would ask you if there is any knowledge as to the identities of murderers of my daughters? I have an uneasy feeling that it was done intentionally. I have strong doubts that out-of-town thieves would rob a house in this district, more so one so close to the prison.~
@106  = ~(With a wince) Lady Bylanna, the terms "punitive action" and "Order of Radiant Heart" are incongruous... No, our interests have not conflicted of late. I thank you for the information, my lady.~
@107  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'd like to have a look at that hayloft. I do not believe we will find anything there, most likely it was but a rendezvous venue, but still who knows.~
@108  = ~I doubt it. I suspect the neighbours have thoroughly examined the place.~
@109  = ~What do you hope to find there? Their headquarters' address? I guess, it's a fools' errand.~
@110  = ~Have you come across any Cyric people before, Keldorn?~
@111  = ~Neighbours... I do not enjoy the closeness of the thieves' guild. And you wonder why I am unkind to thieves! Please, let us go there and look around. Even if we do not find anything, I... I just want to do it.~
@112  = ~All right, let's have it your way.~
@113  = ~Just to clear off your conscience? All right, let's go there.~
@114  = ~But we will find nothing!~
@115  = ~(With a sigh) Then I must go alone for it is something I have to do.~
@116  = ~All right, let's go there.~
@117  = ~Keldorn... I did not say I refused, just expressed my doubts. If you need that so badly, we'll go there. We can do that right now.~
@118  = ~(First deep in thought, but then shakes his head) It's been so long now, and I would not call this incident an encounter. Just one of the missions, where a couple of Cyric Priests just happened to be among the enemy.~
@119  = ~Then I do not understand. OK, let's go there.~
@120  = ~(You shrug your shoulders) Well, then they should not have any claims to you. It must be a coincidence, Keldorn... and our visit won't change anything. But we can go there if it makes you feel better.~
@121  = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@122  = ~Please, do not take me wrong, it's not that I took an oath or something. I need to know! I can not understand for the life of me why this sudden interest in me from the followers of Cyric now. That priest... he addressed you, not me... let us go, we must at least take a look around.~
@123  = ~(Sharply) I am going right now. Will you accompany me... or not <CHARNAME>?~
@124  = ~(You take him by his hand softly) Please take my apologies. I will go with you.~
@125  = ~No.~
@126  = ~I... do not know what to say. You seemed to treat me with compassion and understanding. I must have deceived myself.~
@127  = ~(In a tense voice) <CHARNAME>, look...~
@128  = ~(There is a small ring on his palm) This is Leona's ring. She was always fighting with the boys, and this ring helped to make her more dexterous and wiser... Please, you must have it. There are no more traces here, alas!~
@129  = ~Keldorn... I can't, this is your daughter's ring. It's precious to you. You must have it with you.~
@130  = ~Did you give it to Leona?~
@131  = ~It won't fit my finger, but it will yours. Besides, it could easily get misplaced and is far too precious to leave in a dark backpack.~
@132  = ~I beg you, <CHARNAME>, it will please me to see it on your hand and it will be easier for me that way, believe me. Please let me put it on your finger.~
@133  = ~We found Leona's ring. Keldorn insisted that I should have it. I wanted so much to give him a hug and cheer him up, I just do not know how I managed to contain myself.~
@134  = ~I did. Please... I do not want it to lie on the bottom of my bag. Please take it.~
@135  = ~Very well, Keldorn. Have it your way.~
@136  = ~Please let me put it on your finger.~
@137  = ~(Sigh) That's a hard task that he has committed to, and proof of that is seen by the fate of his previous foster child.~
@138  = ~A paladin can not stay home all the time; his duties constantly call him up... and a child can not be left alone. Nor can a paladin take a child with him. That's why we have orphanages and abbeys.~
@139  = ~Many parents send their children there to be taken care of when they are incapable of doing so themselves.~
@140  = ~My father was a cleric. I was supposed to follow in his steps, but I wanted to become a paladin from since I was a child, <CHARNAME>, and my parents sent me to such a monastery into care.~
@141  = ~And Kamir... by blindly following paladin's rules, he committed an even worse misdemeanour.~
@142  = ~Most likely this girl will suffer the same fate as Stephan or even worse. He should not have kept the boy, but sent him to the asylum, and by doing so he would not have broken his oath to the boy's mother.~
@143  = ~His misfortune is that he interpreted his oath incorrectly. Though... what if I'm wrong, what if Risa were to remain safe and live to serve Kamir as a comfort in his old days. (Sigh)~
@144  = ~(Softly) <CHARNAME>, do not blame yourself. You could not help it, believe me. I know how you feel, I know it only too well. But I also know that revenge will not make you feel better.~
@145  = ~Eventually your heart will lighten, trust me... you and I will remember Ajantis, and we will talk about him later. Now come pull yourself together my lady... do not let anger win over reason. Garren Windspear awaits us.~
@146  = ~<CHARNAME>, look! Holy Avenger! A sword that was granted by Tyr! See how the power within causes it to shimmer!~
@147  = ~Keldorn, take it!~
@148  = ~It is mine!~
@149  = ~(With awe) Oh, no, you can't mean that! The Order sent you to take it from the dragon, I have no right to even touch it.~
@150  = ~Keldorn... you do not have a right... you, paladin of Torm? If there are hands on this earth worthy of this sword, they are your hands.  The Order will understand and welcome my decision. That I am sure of!~
@151  = ~I really do not know, Keldorn. I'd like you to own it.~
@152  = ~Carsomyr... you... you really want  me to have it... ~
@153  = ~Yes! I'm asking you, please...~
@154  = ~I have my own, a gift from Torm and it is the only sword I will ever need. Come, take it!~
@155  = ~No-no. This chatterbox is not bad either.~
@156  = ~As you wish, let it be so.~
@157  = ~I... (Keldorn gets down on one knee and carefully puts his hand under the blade of the sword. As soon as Carsomyr touches his hands, it flashes with bright light, illuminating the gloomy cave of Firkraag. You see Keldorn's shining eyes, his face seems to be lit by some inner light and at this moment you realize that you made the right decision.)~
@158  = ~I told you, you were made for each other.~
@159  = ~(Touching the blade with his lips) You know, I suddenly feel as if the burden of years has slipped from my shoulders... I feel like a man renewed. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. You can not imagine how grateful I am that you ... insisted.~
@160  = ~It does not give you headaches? It's babbling such nonsense.~
@161  = ~I'm not listening. Come on, Keldorn, take it.~
@162  = ~(With a wink) You will let me hold it from time to time though, promise?~
@163  = ~What has happened, sir?~
@164  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm liable for military service and I may not disobey the order. Please, we must follow the Knight.~
@165  = ~Are you staying with us then mage? You do surprise me.~
@166  = ~What's your interest in this war? If you are hoping to get rich on its trophies, THEN you'd be wise to remember that we will be joining with another army... you do understand what it is I am saying don't you?~
@167  = ~What does it matter to you that she is a daughter of Bhaal? It was important in Baldur's Gate, that I understand, but now...~
@168  = ~(Interrupting) ... and guided I might add. I know this Edwin.~
@169  = ~(Hollowly) Yes. I admit my previous words were... well, they matter no more. You have fought by our side, your dark goddess has nursed our wounds, and I no longer have reason to mistrust you. Though, your anxiety is understandable.~
@170  = ~(Wincing) Viconia please, do not call me that, I beg you.~
@171  = ~(His voice becomes conciliatory) Worry not, if we stay close together, nobody will say a word against you. To be sure, it would be best if you kept that hood of yours up at all times.~
@172  = ~I remember you expressing your admiration for Drizzt DoUrden, prelate, if I remember correctly, he is a drow.~
@173  = ~(Putting a hand on Viconia's shoulder) She is an old friend of <CHARNAME>...~
@174  = ~Mmm... now I wonder what the general needs of me? Come <CHARNAME>, let us find out.~
@175  = ~General... I'm not sure that the duke of Esmeltaran will agree to this. The city would be left defenseless.~
@176  = ~(Bitterly) I imagine this priest has died. There is a letter and a ring here, <CHARNAME>.~
@177  = ~"Dear Count, You know that the Temple was a place of safe keeping for an artifact – the ring of Cyric. The great Kelemvor made it clear that this ring should not fall into the hands of followers of the Prince of Lies, and I have seen many of them among the enemy.~
@178  = ~Unfortunately the ring's abilities are yet unknown to me, it is said that mere mortals are not permitted to learn of them. Hide this ring count Firecam I beg you. Keep it from those who covet it for their evil lord! The supreme priest of Kelemvor, Doomguide Marrius."~
@179  = ~(Taking the ring) I believe I understand the power of the ring. It causes the transposition of divine and human essences.~
@180  = ~(Fearfully) Then I beg you, please, on no account must you ever don that ring... it will destroy you, that I am sure!~
@181  = ~I've learned so much today! My Keldorn turned out to be a count, and he has a splendid family castle. His mother is so nice I didn't imagine that she would still be alive... and looking so elegant for her age! But that's not the half of it, the ring of Cyric that fell into my hands showed me a strange and horrible place with odd creatures, pillars of skulls... the vision sent a chill through my very soul... hopefully Keldorn didn't notice.~
@182  = ~<CHARNAME>, my dear friend, I am so grateful to you. You see, this business did not take up too much of our time, and we can continue our journey whenever you are ready.~
@183  = ~Firstly you must take a long rest, get a good nights sleep, who knows when we will have another opportunity. Breakfast is always served in our rooms, that is our custom, but I would like us to have breakfast together tomorrow.~
@184  = ~I will come for you my lady, when you are awake. Good night, my dearest girl (kisses you tenderly on your cheek).~
@185  = ~Good morning to you! You look lovely, and that dress is so becoming on you my lady. (Holding out his hand) Come, breakfast awaits.~
@186  = ~Miss Imoen, I am truely glad that we have finally found you. At last you are safe and free from the clutches of that evil sorcerer!~
@187  = ~Yes, it is forbidden to use magic in the city without the permission of the authorities, but I believe child, that Irenicus would have found a way to steal you law or no law...~
@188  = ~No, no, of course I did not mean that... please forgive me if I have offended you unwittingly. What I meant to say was that I am very pleased to meet you, but alas I've done so rather awkwardly. I ask you once again, please forgive me.~
@189  = ~(Tenderly touching your cheek with his lips) But I ask you, <CHARNAME>, please. If Bodhi has made up her mind to end things here, you can be sure she will do her damndest no matter what. You need to be prepared for that meeting.~
@190  = ~(Whisper) All right, let it be as you wish, but please talk to me, don't be silent.~
@191  = ~And what if I fall asleep? No, it's no good, we have to get out of here.~
@192  = ~(He quickly prepares a place for you to sleep) Here, this should be comfortable, come lay yourself down. Now what do you want to talk about?~
@193  = ~I do not know... You have been silent since we left Esmeltaran! You have something on your mind and it's almost as if you regret that I brought you back to life.~
@194  = ~I get the impression that you are hiding something from me!~
@195  = ~(Quietly. His voice sounding a little hurt) Does my request mean absolutely nothing to you? Tell me <CHARNAME>, how often is it that I ask anything of you?~
@196  = ~Oh, you are so touchy! All right, all right, I'll do as you say but will you talk to me?~
@197  = ~No, not often but often when I do something you have not asked of me... it turns bad. You did not ask me to resurrect you, and now I find myself thinking that it was all for naught!~
@198  = ~(Patting your cheek) It was naive of me to hope that I could conceal my... doubts. No use trying to deceive the eyes of a loving woman. You are right... to some extent, but not that I begrudge that I have returned with you, no. Kelemvor did not erase my memories of that quiet world. I don't know not why but he didn't.~
@199  = ~(Keldorn's eyes are lit with unfamiliar light) I remember it and it will always be with me, can you understand that? I wanted to return with you yes, but at the same time, part of me longed to stay there, and I can't help that, <CHARNAME>.~
@200  = ~You see, death will always be at my side. Despite numerous assassination attempts on your own life you are still unable to understand it! You are not a mere mortal, your death is different.~
@201  = ~Forgive me my dear, I should not be having this conversation with you. I should be encouraging you, giving you strength, but instead my words bring only gloom. (Keldorn gives you a sad smile.)~
@202  = ~I do not know what to say. I understand what you mean. Kelemvor gave me a real lecture before allowing me to talk with you, I... I should have guessed the truth myself.~
@203  = ~I know what death is Keldorn, I bestow it on people and whilst Kelemvor stands at my back, I know I have nothing to fear.~
@204  = ~You do not have to say anything. I will try to make things right. (Bends down and kisses your forehead.) For now, you must rest my dear.~
@205  = ~(With a sigh) That is not what I meant. No matter, forget it and rest for now.~
@206  = ~You are shivering, my dear. I will stoke the fire, though I fear your chill is not a fault of the air.~
@207  = ~No, it isn't. Stand back, Keldorn, I don't know if I can protect you from this.~
@208  = ~You endanger yourself being here. Move, for your own good.~
@209  = ~Get away from me, fool. You endanger your worthless life!~
@210  = ~Your lips move, but no sound emerges. Are you sure you are well... <CHARNAME>? By the gods, <CHARNAME>!!~
@211  = ~Stay away from her, vampire! You and your murderous bastard of a brother had taken too many lives as is. I will not allow you to harm <CHARNAME>...~
@212  = ~Mother please, is not our hasty decision a surprise and a bother to you?~
@213  = ~(Smiles) Why so?~
@214  = ~How dare you!~
@215  = ~(Perplexedly) You mean to say that the wedding...~
@216  = ~I don't believe you, demon! Wait...~
@217  = ~That is it. The end of my happiness, my love, my dreams. I will never become his wife. Maybe if I manage to get rid of this curse, only then. I do not know! And nobody knows, even Great Kelemvor. Why? What have I done to deserve it?~
@218  = ~(Embracing him and touching his cheek with your lips you feel that it is wet.)~ [ifyougo]
@219  = ~Keldorn, you... you are crying? You have not slept at all?~
@220  = ~You... have heard everything? Why then did you not stop me?~
@221  = ~If you had not taken the ring from my finger, I probably would not have woken.~
@222  = ~So you... why did you not say anything? Why did you not stop me?~
@223  = ~(Surprised) Why... what would it have changed? The decision had to be yours <CHARNAME>.~
@224  = ~Remember what I said to you: "Whatever happens, know this - I love you", remember? Do you believe me now my love?~
@225  = ~Yes.~
@226  = ~Is it not frightening to love a girl such as I?~
@227  = ~(Sighs) At last... please give me back the ring. Now tell me, why did you take it from me?~
@228  = ~(Quietly) What if I had left... for good?~
@229  = ~I still do not understand, how can you love me? Is it not frightening to you?~
@230  = ~"What if..."? What do you want to hear, that I would commit suicide rather than live without you? No my love, that I would never do. I would wait for you to change your mind, if necessary, wait until time itself ran out.~
@231  = ~(A sob escapes from your throat) Don't say that... I am not worthy of you.~
@232  = ~<CHARNAME> do you truly think that I could fall in love with an unworthy woman?~
@233  = ~("But you did" comes to your mind, but you wisely keep your thoughts to yourself.) I am such a fool. Forgive me.~
@234  = ~Frightening? Yes... because I am so afraid that you will be taken from me, afraid that you may be made to take your place as a goddess!~
@235  = ~What should I do then? I will probably be afraid now and for the rest of my life.~
@236  = ~(Embracing you tightly) Hush now, no more crying, otherwise your eyes will become red and swollen... not very becoming on such a beautiful face.~
@237  = ~Come, give me a hug my darling and never, never run away from me again!~
@238  = ~(In a low voice) I am to blame. By Torm I should have interfered and persuaded you to put him off his plan! I knew no good would come of it.~
@239  = ~I... I feel as though I have killed him with my own hands. Oh Keldorn, why is that... why do I feel so responsible?~
@240  = ~(Stroking your back) Being tormented with remorse is a quality inherent in every man of honour. To see you so distressed brings a heaviness to my own heart.~
@241  = ~I think I know what it is. Riatavin wanted to go under Tethyr, but the negotiations failed. Perhaps they want to hide that?~
@242  = ~But it's pointless! Why is to kill the refugees? What is it possibly that they could tell that diplomats do not know?~
@243  = ~Getharic! I'm glad to see you, cousin. We'll join the defence forces at once. Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@244  = ~Of course, Keldorn, let's go to the gate.~
@245  = ~It seems we don't have much choice here.~
@246  = ~Keldorn, we cannot go fighting unprepared. Let's take up arms, prepare potions and spells.~
@247  = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>.~
@248  = ~Of course, you have a choice, <CHARNAME>. You may stay inside the castle walls and avoid being hurt.~
@249  = ~Sorry, Keldorn. Let's go to the gate.~
@250  = ~Okay, <CHARNAME>, in your time.~
@251  = ~I am to make yet another arduous journey, this time whilst in your service, <CHARNAME>. (*Sighs*) Will Torm never end the travels of this old Paladin?~
@252  = ~These are strange words I hear from Tilorn. I have never seen such a thing done or even knew such a thing was possible.~
@253  = ~I know not what manner of men you and Tilorn are Hrothgar, nor do I wish to know at this present time, but I believe Torm would not have me aid you if your intent was evil, so I will follow you to this Halruaa and aid your cause in any way that I can.~
@254  = ~By all that is holy <CHARNAME>, is nothing sacred to you?~
@255  = ~Please Dar, call me Keldorn. We are all friends here, and the formalities of titles have no place among friends.~
@256  = ~Envy is a powerful emotion and unless it is contained, it can quickly give rise to wrongful actions in order to obtain that which is envied.~
@257  = ~As a follower of the teachings of Ilmater, I am surprised to hear you use such a term my friend.~
@258  = ~(*He reaches up and puts his hand on the half orc’s shoulder*) My friend, I understand why you should feel that love will always elude you.~
@259  = ~But love is not dependent solely on appearance or the race we are born into. Love reaches into the heart and it is that which is found there which deems us worthy of another’s love.~
@260  = ~(*His voice takes on a tone of sadness*) I can not answer you truthfully for the female heart is a mystery to all men, but I do  know that women are very different to men in the way they perceive a worthy lover.~
@261  = ~It is true, many will look at a man’s face or his purse first, often not taking the time to look deeper into the heart where the true face of a man lies... and later they bemoan that they have married a cruel, heartless man.~
@262  = ~Then there is the woman who is first your friend... she has taken the time, watched, spoken with you and found you worthy to be called friend.~
@263  = ~Neither of you seek anything more than the bond that the love of friends forge, but as the friendship strengthens, so her eyes become open to what lies beneath. Then she may open her heart to a different sort of love.~
@264  = ~Once again, I do not know Dar, but I do know that such women are to be found and you my friend, are so much more than the half-orc that you perceive yourself as.~
@265  = ~Not only myself but also your friends here have witnessed, many times, the honour that dwells within your heart.~
@266  = ~Should you be lucky enough to procure the love of such a woman, then you will be blessed because you’ll know that your love embraces you for all that you are, and she will stand beside you, defending against any who would attempt to deride her love.~
@267  = ~My friend, whatever the future does or does not bring, you will always have the friends that you have made this day. Remember this.~
@268  = ~May your god take pity and forgive you gnome, for you are indeed a pitiful beast to behold.~
