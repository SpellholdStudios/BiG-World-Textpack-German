@0    = ~Yoshimo-san. My great pleasure is to see you again. Uncle often said you will return to help your family and so you did.~
@1    = ~Your father will explain the things happening around here to you better than I can. Hashimoto's stronghold is just to the east and south from here. Hurry there Yoshimo, for we need help. And you can kill the Nakanishi wench, you have captured. There is no law above us any more but the honor of Hashimoto.~
@2    = ~As you wish, Yoshimo-san. But you should remember that "one must aim not to disappoint his father." Have you forgotten the teachings of our ancestors in the strange lands?~
@3    = ~Ha-ha-ha...(*laughs madly*)~
