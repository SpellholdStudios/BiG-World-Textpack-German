@2    = ~I can’t believe my luck... here I am, studying at the greatest Academy in the land.~
@3    = ~Yea gods, why did I choose to study enchantment. That Xan is so bloody pessimistic and uninspiring for an enchanter!~
@4    = ~If you haven’t chosen your specialisation yet take a tip from me, avoid conjuration... Mordecai sets more homework than the rest of the tutors put together!~

@6    = ~Damn this heat! Word is we’re in for another blasted sand storm tomorrow.~

@14   = ~Sorry, I can’t help you as I am new here myself. Come to think of it... I don’t think I saw that name on the tutor roster.~
