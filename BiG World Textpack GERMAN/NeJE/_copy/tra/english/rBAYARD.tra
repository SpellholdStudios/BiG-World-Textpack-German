@0    = ~One of your friends; they did not happen to be named Ginny, did they?~
@1    = ~You know the lass, or did her mother send you to check on her? She is a worrisome little parent, isn't she? Perhaps rightly so, I worried about the girl too. She does not take much of this seriously, and when she realizes what she has been through it may be a rude awakening, to be sure. She is with my fellows, deeper than I wished to go. You may find them if you search, but I think the way they went has been blocked. There be so many passages it seems Durlag felt he could afford to collapse a few behind the unwary.~
@2    = ~Find Therella's daughter, Ginny, in Durlag's Tower.

One of Bayard's comrades was the lass named Ginny that I have come to rescue. Bayard thinks the girl is in over her head, but it is her head to do with what she pleases.~
