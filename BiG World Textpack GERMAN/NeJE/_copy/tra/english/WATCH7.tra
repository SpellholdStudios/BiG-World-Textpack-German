@0    = ~Hey there kid, nothing to see here.~
@1    = ~Please, open the gate.~
@2    = ~Thankfully quiet here today, as usual.  I hear there are problems outside, though; something about an iron shortage.~
@3    = ~Winthrop has kept his prices as low as he could, but I expect that to change soon.  It's been weeks since a trading caravan has made it here.~
@4    = ~It is a good thing we are not called upon to defend Candlekeep more often.  I've a cousin in Nashkel that sent word of an iron shortage that is beginning to cripple their local guards.~
@5    = ~I was in one of the great spires of the keep last night, and saw the strangest sight.  The horizon was aglow for a time, as though many a man carried torches in the distance.  Usually there are only merchants on that path, though never at night.  Bandits perhaps, but so many?~
@6    = ~Sure.~
