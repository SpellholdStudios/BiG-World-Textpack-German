From the damage you've done to this tower, I can tell you're in a violent state of mind. I'll try to find a way to fix your problem. Until then, stay here and do harm to no one. Farewell.~
@31   = ~It is my duty as a soldier of faith to fight darkness wherever I find it. You are a threat to this valley and its people. Your dark aura reveals your true nature as the summer sun reveals god's world. Farewell, evil-doer.~
@32   = ~I'll be watching you. Farewell.~
