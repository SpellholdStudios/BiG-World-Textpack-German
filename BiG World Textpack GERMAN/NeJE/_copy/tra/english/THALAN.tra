@0    = ~I don't have much patience for strangers on my property.  Do us both a favor and move along... unless of course you have magic for sale.  From the looks of you, you don't look as if you could afford the items I have for sale.~
@1    = ~I sincerely hope you have some reason for bothering me.  I've already stated that I wish you to leave.~
@2    = ~Rumors talk of a powerful mage that lives out here.  If it is you, I would like to speak with you.~
@3    = ~I go where I wish and stay as long as I please.  Don't threaten me.~
@4    = ~I apologize for the intrusion, and will leave immediately.~
@5    = ~Well... it's rather amusing actually.  You see, I happened to rescue this... um... talking chicken...~
@6    = ~Rumors?  Bah! There is no mage here that wishes to speak or be spoken of.  Unless, of course, if you have magic that you wish to sell.~
@7    = ~We're interested in selling or even buying magical items.  What do you have?~
@8    = ~Sorry but we do not.~
@9    = ~Hmm.  A bold statement were I an orc or a hobgoblin.  I am, however, not someone it would be wise for you to attack.  I should let this threat go no further if I were you.  Be a good little adventurer and leave me be.~
@10   = ~As well you should.  Goodbye.~
@11   = ~I have nothing more to say to you.  Leave me.~
@12   = ~Fool!  What kind of simpleton attacks a foe he does not know!  Bah!  I will not waste my time on you!~
@13   = ~Chickens do not talk, so quite obviously it is a polymorphed being of some kind.  Spells such as that wear off in time or can be dispelled.  'Tis a simple matter and one not worth the waste of my day.  Keep moving.~
@14   = ~I am quite aware of the mute status of chickens, thank you very much!  Yes this is a transformed man, but it is also a man who claims to be your apprentice.  That is why I brought him here.~
@15   = ~There is no call to be so rude.  Why are you so reluctant to deal with me?~
@16   = ~Spare me your sanctimonious tone, old mage.  I have brought this man here and now will leave you be.~
@17   = ~I have no desire to extend any dealings with the likes of you.  I simply wish people would respect my wish for privacy.~
@18   = ~I sympathize, but this is a special case.  I would not have bothered you, save that this afflicted fowl claims to be an apprentice of yours.~
@19   = ~If that is what you wish, though a little interaction might do you some good.  It is rumored you gave up the company of adventurers, but I would hazard a bet that you would enjoy a dungeon romp every now and then.~
@20   = ~Then I shall respect your wish.  Might I leave this unfortunate creature here with you?  I am unable to help, but mayhaps you can?~
@21   = ~Apprentice?!  I have had no apprentices!  I teach no one about what I... wait... Melicamp?  MELICAMP, is that you?!!~
@22   = ~I would just as soon have done with both of you, but I will settle for just the one leaving.  I will do the minimum that I can for this unfortunate foul.~
@23   = ~A talking chicken.

I have taken Melicamp the chicken to Thalantyr at High Hedge.  I do not wish to see how the poor wizard turns out, not because I hold anything against him.  Rather, Thalantyr's rather insulting demeanour leaves me no choice.~
@24   = ~You know nothing of me!  Best that you pray, to whatever deity turns your crank, that you NEVER face what I have seen.  Bah!  The inexperience and STUPIDITY of youth.  I care not if you go out and get yourself killed, for it's not the least favorable end you could face!  If you have business here I suggest you get to it!  Otherwise, begone!~
@25   = ~Um... sorry for bringing up bad memories.  Your experience does not change mine though, and however serious and depressing the past may be, we are still currently left with this talking chicken.  Care to parley with the poulet, or should I just give you the bird?~
@26   = ~My sincerest apologies for presuming to know your situation.  I shall leave quickly, though I wish to leave this feathered fellow with you.  I lack the means to free him myself.~
@27   = ~No need to bite my head off for your past weaknesses.  I am quite well aware of the dangers, and I keep them a blade's length away.  Had you been more competent in your youth, perhaps you would not be the scared little man you are today.~
@28   = ~May you live to be as scared as I am, instead of as naive as you are.  Begone, and I shall do what is necessary for this feathered fool.~
@29   = ~HAhaha!  *snicker* um, yes... well.  I suppose we should deal with the situation at hand.  Now then my good chicken, *snicker* what seems to be the problem?~
@30   = ~I have specifically brought him here because he claimed to be an apprentice of yours.  It seemed likely that you would help.~
@31   = ~If you will help him, then I'll be on my way.  I only wished to see him to safety.~
@32   = ~You are too much a lout to carry such puerile behavior.  I am neither amused, nor impressed.  Leave me the bird and I will do what I can.  That said, I wish you to leave immediately.~
@33   = ~While mildly amusing, you lack the charm to cover the fact that this person is quite likely experiencing some severe emotional distress.  I suggest that you stop making fun of him and tell me exactly why you brought him here.~
@34   = ~I am no "master" to you, and you are no "apprentice!"  What gall you have to expect help from me!~
@35   = ~I see you two are well-acquainted.  I shall leave you to it, then.  Fare you well.~
@36   = ~He is not your student?  But you do know of him, do you not?~
@37   = ~A student wishes to LEARN, while this fool wishes only to have knowledge.  I will tutor no one who does not understand the ramifications of what I have to teach!  Not getting the quick gratification he wished, he instead chose to steal from me!~
@38   = ~It has taken me some fifty-odd years of life to gain the power I wield, and the will not to use it.  You are but a baby in comparison.  Frankly, I'm surprised you changed into such an OLD chicken!  How DID you manage that, by the by?  You were muddling the simplest cantrip when last I observed you.~
@39   = ~As I thought.  Well, it's obvious you can steal my tools, but not my understanding of them.  Hold still while I dispel this foolish facade.  Can't very well get my property back while it's polymorphed into y... wait a moment.  I did not possess any items that allow the casting of that enchantment.  Wait... oh dear... Melicamp, listen very carefully.  What did you take?~
@40   = ~A pair of... oh no.  You little FOOL!  The bracers in my locked and trapped safe?!  I certainly hope you can develop a taste for chicken feed, because you are going to be stuck the way you are for a very long time!~
@41   = ~It's not a matter of whether I wish to help or not, simply that I do not have the power to undo what you have done.~
@42   = ~Is there nothing that can be done?  I am willing to help however I can.~
@43   = ~I believe the price for my assistance just went up, eh Thalantyr?~
@44   = ~That was a sad story indeed, but I have played my part already.  Good luck to both of ye, and now I take my leave.~
@45   = ~What sort of item could cause such a problem for even such a mage as yourself?~
@46   = ~The magic that so many revere today was not always the same as it is now.  Any adventurer worth his salt should know this, and know that not every bauble they wring from a dungeon will be helpful.  The bracers in question were a vain little reminder of... well... it doesn't really matter does it?  Suffice to say that I have no idea what their intended function was, and I was in no position to ask their former owner.  Years have passed since my... release, and the spoils of that Netheril ruin remain as enigmatic as ever.  They resist even the strongest divination, and attempts to dispel result only in explosive consequences.  Some things should just stay buried.~
@47   = ~It's a sad story indeed, but I have played my part already.  Good luck to both of you, and now I take my leave.~
@48   = ~You'll get no coin from me over this matter.  I will pay the way of no adventurer.  Everyone makes their own bed to lay in, and must reap the rewards of their own actions.  Now, If this little chicken-afflicted fellow wishes to pay you he may, though I wager he has little more than the items he stole from me.~
@49   = ~If there be no reward, then I am through with the matter.  Fare thee well.~
@50   = ~I shall help as best I can and ask for nothing in return.  He is in need, and that is all that matters.~
@51   = ~If you are willing, then I will do what must be done.  We will need a component that I do not have on hand, and it will be your job to get it.  I will require the head of an undead creature, and a simple skeleton skull will do.  Bring it back here and I will try to bend a few magical rules to reincarnate this foolish boy.~
@52   = ~There must be a dead element, yes.  That is what the skull is for.  I cannot fully explain what I am to try, but it's something of a reversal on the reincarnation scheme.  The age of the enchantment that changed you may allow for a loophole in the laws of magic.  Of course it may just kill us both in the casting.  Such is life.  Off you go to some dungeon or another.  Return with the skull.  Go.~
@53   = ~A talking chicken.

I must bring a skull back to Thalantyr, so he can try to restore Melicamp to a human form.~
@54   = ~You have returned without the needed component.  Bring a skeleton's skull to me, or this young lad may just as well begin planning a life full of nestbuilding and egg-laying.~
@55   = ~Hello again, my young adventurers.  I see you have the needed component.  Well, shall we see if our young man regains his life, or if he'll eventually be someone's festhall dinner?~
@56   = ~And that, as they say, is that.  I fear our young friend did not survive the casting, and I feel a touch weary myself.  Such are the ways of magic: unpredictable at the best of times.  Do not feel responsible for his death, there was little more we could have done.  His body simply couldn't withstand the change once again.  A lesson, I suppose, for the rest of us.  Take good care to treat "found" items with respect.  If you will excuse me, I have some work to do.  I imagine you've a dungeon to storm somewhere.  I wish you "intelligence," because "luck" runs out.~
@57   = ~A talking chicken.

I brought a skull back to Thalantyr as he requested, but his attempt to restore Melicamp was unfortunately a failure. Apparently the young man's body could not stand the shock of transformation again. Thalantyr said there was nothing we could have done to have changed the outcome, it was simply a matter of luck. Magic remains an uncertain force, and care must be taken in its use.~
@58   = ~Yes yes boy, now be quiet a moment.  Blast it.  The Bracers are no longer on him.  It is as I feared.  Likely they either spent what magic they had in a single charge, or it is their wont to be whisked away after inflicting the damage they do.  I had hoped to seal them away, but now it's certain they will fall into the hands of some other unfortunate fool.  Tell me Melicamp: do you quite feel yourself again?~
@59   = ~And that, as they say, is that.~
@60   = ~Good, though it was the greatest of luck you did not retain a wing for a limb.  You always were a bit cockeyed, but I suppose that doesn't count.  I suggest you remain here, however, so that I might keep an eye on you.  If you insist on playing with the forces of magic, at least I should see that you understand them.  Perhaps you will be a touch more cautious, now that you have experienced what can go wrong.~
@61   = ~*sigh*  I suppose your master I must be.  And you <CHARNAME>.  I trust you will be cautious in your travels as well?  I wish you "intelligence" on your journeys.  I would wish you "luck," but it runs out much quicker than you would think.  Good day.~
@62   = ~A talking chicken.

I brought a skull back to Thalantyr as he requested, and his attempt to restore Melicamp was a success. The young man's body withstood the strain of transformation again, and he seems eager to learn from his mistakes.  Thalantyr cautioned that a tragic ending was just as likely, and that care should always be taken in the use of magic, no matter how benign it seems.~
@63   = ~I am Thalantyr, and I am known as the High Hedge wizard.  I suffered something I won't even tell you, my closest friend, so I live up here alone.  I used to adventure, but I'll not go back to those foolish days.  You would do well to be careful too.~
@64   = ~Get out of my sight!  I'll do nothing for you!~
@65   = ~I thought it too much for a mage of your repute to remember me, but maybe you recall the unfortunate situation Melicamp was in when I brought him to you on my previous visit... he was shall we shall in *fowl* form.~
@66   = ~I am here seeking knowledge that I have been led to believe you may have.~
@67   = ~My friend Taffic here requires your aid in order to achieve a life long dream of his.~
@68   = ~I have come here in the hope that you can teach this gnome some sense and in doing so give me some peace from his insane fantasy.~
@69   = ~I have a letter here from one Leanaro and he has written that you may be able to help with the plight of my friend Taffic here.~
@70   = ~Look here, I have come all the way from Athkatla in order to speak with you and I am not leaving until you have heard what it is I have to say!~
@71   = ~I have travelled far in order to speak with you and my temper is becoming frayed... you will listen to me!~
@72   = ~Please, I have had a long and arduous journey to get here, won’t you at least humour me and listen to my plea?~
@73   = ~That was you? (*Peering at you closer*) I suppose you could be that person... many faces have come and gone ... with them goes any reason to remember them. It is Melicamp who is beholden to you not me so unless you have magic to sell I suggest you leave.~
@74   = ~Hold a second... you have not heard my reason for being here. Surely you can spare a few moments of your time to hear me out.~
@75   = ~Now just one second here, just who do you think you are to be dismissing me without hearing what I have to say?~
@76   = ~I buy and I sell magic... I do not teach nor do I advise. As for the world and the problems of its people, they are no concern of mine. If you are not here to trade then I have nothing to say to you... now leave me be.~
@77   = ~Athkatla you say... well I wish you a pleasant and safe journey back to Athkatla.~
@78   = ~Mighty mage or not, I will not be spoken down to as though I were nothing but an insect buzzing around your head... something irritating to be flicked away!~
@79   = ~This has been a huge waste of my time, we will learn nothing from this mage. We may as well do as he says and leave before we anger him any more.~
@80   = ~No, but you will listen to me. You see these golems I have around the place... well it is not for their scintillating conversation that I keep them. One word from me and they are more than capable of taking care of undesirable trespassers in my home. Now, be a good little adventurer and leave me be.~
@81   = ~You still here? Did I not ask you to leave me be?~
@82   = ~Leanaro you say ... now that is a name I haven’t thought of in a long while. Tell me how is the canny elf?~
@83   = ~I have to admit I do not know Leanaro, but I have his letter to Deidre. Here, you are welcome to read it for yourself.~
@84   = ~Here, I think it best if you read the letter yourself as it explains our purpose for being here.~
@85   = ~He speaks fondly of you too Thalantyr, here read his letter for yourself.~
@86   = ~(*To your surprise a smile comes to the mage’s lips and he even chuckles softly as he reads the letter*). Well I never... so Leanaro married Carialie after all.~
@87   = ~I wonder how he managed to talk that old goat of a father of hers into agreeing to giving him his daughter’s hand?~
@88   = ~If things had been different... no matter, what’s past is past, let’s see why he has sent you young adventurers to my abode.~
@89   = ~So it is the miracle of Gravelk that we seek. (*Looking at Taffic*) Then you must be the gnome he speaks of eh?~
@90   = ~So you also have big ideas do you, is there some fair maiden that you wish to impress my little discontented gnome?~
@91   = ~Possibly I can, Leanaro speaks the truth of what I witnessed at the home of Aldruis.~
@92   = ~When I speak of the miracle of Gravelk I am referring to the dwarf whom he speaks of in his letter, the dwarf who became an elf.~
@93   = ~Now the question is, what can you do for me in exchange for what I know?~
@94   = ~<CHARNAME> now that is a name known widely in this area. I did not realise who your companion was until you spoke their name.~
@95   = ~Rumour has it that <PRO_HESHE> is one of the children of Bhaal, although it is only whispered but many believe it to be true.~
@96   = ~What do you say <CHARNAME>, is there some truth in those whispered rumours?~
@97   = ~It is true, Bhaal is my father but having the god of murder for a father is not something I make a point of advertising.~
@98   = ~It is true, but once known the fact often brings out the worst in people so I prefer not to make my identity common knowledge if I can help it.~
@99   = ~Maybe it is true and maybe it is not, but that is no one’s business but my own.~
@100  = ~Then we shall speak no more of it, the matter is forgotten.~
@101  = ~However, there is still the matter of what you can do for me and as your gnome here has kindly informed me that nothing is beyond you, I think I may have the very thing that needs taking care of.~
@102  = ~This area is notorious for the numerous amount of undead that walk and no matter how many are destroyed, the very next day as many appear again. It is getting to the point where people are afraid to visit my store and my sales of magic are slowly diminishing.~
@103  = ~Not so fast my little friend, has no one ever told you not to agree to anything until you have heard the whole story?~
@104  = ~Anyway, as I was about to say, I have at last discovered where it is they originate from but as of yet I have not had the time to deal with the problem. There is a house just west of here and it has been taken over by a necromancer.~
@105  = ~It would seem that he is doing some research into undead creatures and he is continually animating them, then discarding them when he has finished whatever it is he is doing, leaving them to roam at will.~
@106  = ~If you would take care of this problem for me then I will tell you what I know of changing person’s race.~
@107  = ~I will put an end to this abomination immediately.~
@108  = ~I will seek out this necromancer and if he refuses to cease this practise he will join his creations in the ranks of the dead.~
@109  = ~A simple enough task I will return when it is done.~
@110  = ~Another distasteful task! I am tired of doing the dirty work of others, you will have to take care of him yourself. Come we are leaving.~
@111  = ~Good, now hurry along and come back when the problem is sorted.~
@112  = ~Has the necromancer and his minions been dealt with <CHARNAME>? Is the area around my abode safe once more?~
@113  = ~Not yet. I will return when it is done.~
@114  = ~Then hurry and come back when the problem is sorted.~
@115  = ~So <CHARNAME>, tell me, how did you suddenly take on the semblance of a forest gnome? Was it some trick played on you by the necromancer?~
@116  = ~You must forgive Taffic, sometimes his delusions of grandeur, make him forget who he is.~
@117  = ~He’s just excited, he truly believes that you can help him become what he isn’t.~
@118  = ~Jesting aside, I have done what you asked and now it is for you to give me, or rather, to give Taffic the information he wants before he bursts a blood vessel through excitement.~
@119  = ~Of course, you must be anxious to be on your way ... all of you, just as I am anxious to have my home to myself once more.~
@120  = ~Let me assure you that what Leanaro wrote in his letter was true, a dwarf did enter the home of my friend Aldruis and an elf did leave...~
@121  = ~Not so fast Taffic. I said I was witness to it... I didn’t take part in the sorcery myself. That was all Aldruis’ doing and unfortunately he didn’t impart the secret to me.~
@122  = ~I couldn’t even be certain that it was not an illusion put on by Aldruis for my benefit, it was the sort of thing he would do and at the time, nor anytime since, have I ever thought to question what I saw.~
@123  = ~There was however, another witness present, his apprentice Rhezon and you can be sure Aldruis will have passed all his knowledge of arcane magic on to Rhezon. He looked upon the boy as if he were the son he never had...~
@124  = ~(*Sternly*) Hm. A bold statement were I an orc or a hobgoblin. I am however, not someone it would be wise for you to attack my little gnome.~
@125  = ~I will forgive your outburst this once but you would be wise to let a man finish speaking before interrupting again, another may not be as tolerant as me. As I was about to say ... when Aldruis died, I heard that Rhezon had travelled and settled in Trademeet.~
@126  = ~A town not too far from where you have just travelled from I believe. I also hear that Rhezon has made quite a name for himself as a very powerful and knowledgeable sage.~
@127  = ~He is the one you must now seek out ... now if you will excuse me our business is concluded and I wish you to leave.~
