@0    = ~Who... who are you people? You are not employees of my father, that much is obvious.~ [leina_01]
@1    = ~No, we are not employees of your father, Leina. There is no time to explain, you are free but we must make haste and leave here quickly.~
@2    = ~Do not be afraid, Leina, you are free but I am not sure for how long. There may be more of your father’s guards about so we should move quickly.~
@3    = ~You girl, Leina is it? You have your freedom but I suggest you take it whilst you can.~
@4    = ~I will gladly leave this place, but not before I know more of my rescuer and how you came to be here? My father would not have relinquished the key to my prison easily, unless... unless as D’Cai says, he is dead.~ [leina_02]
@5    = ~Forgive my manners Leina, I am <CHARNAME>. Samuel Thunderburp, the bartender of The Five Flagons was concerned for your safety and bid us to find you. Further answers will have to wait until we are safely out of here.~
@6    = ~I am called <CHARNAME>. We were promised a reward by the old barkeep of The Five Flagons if we found you safe. Well, we have found you and you seem to be unharmed so we guess we have earned our reward.~
@7    = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Forgive my haste, Leina, but this is not the time for questions, I urge you to hurry.~
@8    = ~Ah yes, Samuel. I should have realised, he is a good man and knows me well enough to know I would not let him down without good cause. I thank you, <CHARNAME>, for coming to my aid, but what of my father?~ [leina_03]
@9    = ~You can thank me later, Leina, and I assure you, that you will have your answers, just not now. For the moment it is safer if you make your way to The Five Flagons. Samuel will be relieved to have you safely under his roof again.~
@10   = ~Thanks is all well and good, but my interest is in the reward. When you return to the tavern be sure to tell that old barkeep that I am close behind you.~
@11   = ~You can thank me later, Leina, and I assure you, that you will have your answers, just not now. For the moment it is safer if we make our way out of here.~
@12   = ~Thanks is all well and good, but we must hurry.~
@13   = ~I can well understand your urgency to leave this place, so my questions will wait, however, my appreciation for your aid will not, I thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@14   = ~If I return to the inn, I will not remain there, <CHARNAME>, I should not have stayed as long in Athkatla as I have.~ [leina_04]
@15   = ~My only reason for doing so was the hope of a reconciliation with my father but my mother’s death has changed him so, I am not even sure that I want a reconciliation with the man he has become.~ [leina_05]
@16   = ~Nor do I wish to remain at The Five Flagons with the memories of the last few days keeping me from my sleep each night.~ [leina05a]
@17   = ~To leave the safety of the inn at this time, do you see that as a wise decision Leina?~
@18   = ~What other choice do you have Leina?~
@19   = ~Whatever you decide to do is not my concern. Just do not go skipping the city until you have shown yourself to that barkeep, he owes me for your freedom.~
@20   = ~I have little choice now, <CHARNAME>, other than to leave Athkatla. My father will not miss me, and Samuel will understand my reasons for going.~ [leina_06]
@21   = ~I would feel much safer in your company if you have room for me in your group, but be it with you or be it alone, either way I will be taking to the road.~ [leina06a]
@22   = ~It is an uncertain and hostile road that I travel. One that I feel you will not find easy Leina, but if you are sure that this is the right path for you then you are welcome to join me. I would sleep better knowing that you are safe.~
@23   = ~I have no use for a minstrel! The reward is my only concern. Go and take your problems with you. I have enough problems of my own without you adding to them.~
@24   = ~I am sorry Leina, I have no room for you at this moment, but before you leave be sure to let Samuel know that you are safe. We will check on you back at the inn.~
@25   = ~If that is your final word, I will thank you again for my rescue and return to the inn to assure Samuel that I am safe but I will not remain there for long. Goodbye to you, <CHARNAME>.~ [leina_07]
@26   = ~It gives me great comfort to hear you say this. Please, <CHARNAME>, accompany me to the inn so that I may collect my things and we will leave this place together.~ [leina_08]
@27   = ~I would feel much safer in your company if you have room for me in your group, but be it with you or be it alone, either way I will be taking to the road.~ [leina_09]
@28   = ~I have no use for a minstrel! Go and take your problems with you. I have enough problems of my own without you adding to them.~
@29   = ~I am sorry Leina, I have no room for you at this moment.~
@30   = ~If that is your final word, I will thank you again for my rescue and return to the Five Flagons Inn, but I will not remain there for long. Goodbye to you, <CHARNAME>.~ [leina_10]
@31   = ~It gives me great comfort to hear you say this. Please, <CHARNAME>, accompany me to the Five Flagons Inn, so that I may collect my things and we will leave this place together.~ [leina_08]
@32   = ~It is truly good to see you again ,<CHARNAME>. Can I take it that your reappearance here means that you have need of me once more?~
@33   = ~It is good to see you again Leina, and if you are free it is my intention to ask you to join with me once more. Are you free to consider my offer?~
@34   = ~I have been hoping that you would pass this way again with such a request. I gladly accept, and I am ready to leave with you now, <CHARNAME>.~
@35   = ~That is fine with me, though I will not remain here for long. Goodbye to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@36   = ~(*She kisses the hafling man fondly*)... Then this is goodbye Samuel, thank you for all that you have done... your memory will always hold a place in my heart, you I shall never forget. Goodbye my friend.~
@37   = ~(*She looks about the room and sighs*)... This lowly inn has afforded me more comfort and warmth than any place I have called home... I will not stay away long.~
