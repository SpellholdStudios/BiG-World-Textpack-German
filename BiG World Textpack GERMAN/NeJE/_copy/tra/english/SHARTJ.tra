@2    = ~This place does feel different, but we should not get our hopes up nor let our guard down because of the way we feel.

@17   = ~(*Then looking disparagingly at you*)... Some with the help of others, those who didn’t were weak and deserve no more than death. At least as fodder for the beasts their bodies will serve a damn sight better than they would have served as warriors!~

@28   = ~(*Scoffs*)... Who do you think you’re fooling priestess, it’s as plain as the nose on your face that you wish your duty is to *lay with* the paladin! It has nothing to do with Tempus’ will or the will of any other god either... weak pathetic woman you are!~

@56   = ~Do not question my intentions. You don’t have the power to dismiss me Paladin. An oath is an oath and I pledged my sword to aid <CHARNAME>, my word is my bond but make NO mistake... I follow only because of <PRO_HISHER> prowess in battle. When that falters, so does my loyalty.~
@57   = ~As for you paladin... I have no such loyalty to you, but you can be sure that as long as you don’t cross me you have nothing to fear... cross me and it’ll be your front you need to watch... back stabbing is the way of weak cowards!~

@59   = ~(*Wiping her sword on her sleeve*) That’s that... one less slimy reptile hunting for his mistress.

@66   = ~(*Gruffly*) So, you expect me to be a dogsbody again! Nothing more than a lackey paid to do battle with marauders to do what? Save the lands of a pompous, cretinous male, too yellow bellied to sully his own hands!~

@70   = ~Your delusions of grandeur are pathetic you mindless zombie! You flatter yourself if you think I am here looking to settle old scores. For that you’ll find Angelo Dossan in the abyss, go take your grievances to him there.~

@72   = ~Oh I’d know him alright! If he were here, we’d all know it. He’d be pretty hard to miss... and of course there’s the stench, even a blind man could pick up on the stink he gives off.~
@73   = ~Yea gods, is there no limit to a male’s ego? Men really are pathetic! You must have a tapeworm in your brain addling it if you expect me to believe that it was you who taught him... you who are too weak to protect your own!~
@74   = ~I heard that the snake out foxed and wormed his knowledge out of a...~
@75   = ~Why the egotistical braggart... curses on me for believing a male’s pathetic fantasies! His ego was bigger than yours! (*Then letting her fingers stroke the hilt of her sword... flames begin to flicker at her fingertips*)...~
@76   = ~If what you say is truth then I have a proposition for you. You return that which he paid you with and I’ll not show these good people the true colour of a coward’s heart. A fair trade wouldn’t you say?~

@78   = ~What are we waiting for? Let’s get the hell to sorting out his bloody problem and then I swear, when next we meet, his lands will run red with his own blood... I’ll have both his heart and my legacy!~
@79   = ~Ten thousand gold and a legacy, the day just keeps on getting better! Let’s give the arrogant lord what he wants... collect the gold and you can then have your fun taking this legacy of yours from him.~
@80   = ~Skeletons in the closet eh... keeping secrets are we? If I’m to risk my neck then you best be quick and tell me what this legacy is worth?~
@81   = ~Of course and you can tell me about this legacy of Angelo’s along the way.~
@82   = ~Not so fast my girl... not before you tell me what that was all about?~
@83   = ~No, Shar-Seel! We lend our arms and leave when I say we do and not before!~
@84   = ~(*She smiles to herself as you walk away*)... This is going to be easier than I thought... and it’s going to be a real pleasure teaching that snooty, pathetic sap Firkraag that he made a big mistake in judging the daughter by the father!~
@85   = ~(*Snarls*) That is none of your bloody business! The gold offered is more than enough reward for you. The other is personal and will remain so. If not, then you can forget our deal and I’ll be leaving!~
@86   = ~Hummm... point taken! The gold will suffice but I am still curious about this legacy but we will talk about that later.~
@87   = ~It is my business if you want me to aid you in collecting it! So... what did Angelo give our Lord Firkraag that’s got you so fired up?~
@88   = ~Look here, you want me to risk the group’s lives for this legacy, so you’d better be telling me what it is or we aren’t going anywhere near Windspear Hills!~
@89   = ~Come Shar-Teel, it is not my intention to take it from you... especially if it’s all you have left of your father. I am curious only to know how much Angelo’s knowledge was worth to him. No matter, if it’s so important to you we will of course leave immediately.~
@90   = ~Good! You stick to that and we’ll both come out of this richer for our troubles.~
@91   = ~(*Begrudgingly she glares at you and answers*)... It’s personal! All you need know is after the bastard had sown his seed he turned tail and skulked away before the sun hit the sky! He took his pleasure and now he is dead!~
@92   = ~I didn’t ask for the life that I was brought into... the least he can do is compensate me with a few luxuries. It’s mine and I intend to have it! So can we stop yammering and get after the pompous cretin?~
@93   = ~Okay, okay... point taken! By rights it is your legacy, your help with Firkraag will be payment enough, the gold is all that I am after.~
@94   = ~It is not my intention to take it from you... especially if it’s all you have left of your father. I was curious that is all. We will of course leave immediately.~
@95   = ~No, Shar-Teel! We lend our arms and leave when I say we do and not before!~
@96   = ~You’re quick enough to demand a share in the spoils Shar-Teel and so it will be with this legacy of yours. Now if that doesn’t suit you, you can go ask Lord Firkraag for it yourself!~
@97   = ~Hey, don’t you go getting the wrong idea here! There’s no sentiments attached to this quest, it’s about me getting back what, by birth, is rightfully mine... and it’s going to be a real pleasure teaching that stuck up, pathetic fool Firkraag that he made a big mistake in judging the daughter by the father!~
@98   = ~Journey to the Windspear Hills.

I was approached by a Lord Jierdan Firkraag, whose lands outside of Athkatla are being plagued by ogre bandits. He has asked that I journey to the Windspear Hills and kill these ogres, and has offered a 10,000 gp reward for the deed.~
@99   = ~Well don’t leave it too long... a couple of days and I am gone from this miserable group of cowardly misfits!~
@100  = ~I’ll do just that and collect the gold as well for my trouble! Now that I’m finally released from this infernal duty, I swear by every god in a million pantheons, I’ll NEVER lose another duel and put myself in the service of a group of cowardly misfits again!~
@101  = ~(*Casting a glance at the bodies in the room*) If that’s the best Lord Firkraag has then we should be back in time for supper. So get the pot boiling. Nothing sharpens the appetite or quickens the pulse quite like the screams of the enemy and the sight of their blood at the height of the battle... music to my ears it is.~
@102  = ~(*Scoffs at the man’s concern*) His tricks don’t frighten me. He’s a cowardly, spineless lump of jelly who hides behind magic to discredit us and then sends others to do his dirty work! I have the measure of the craven cur and when he feels cold steel slide into his belly he’ll finally have the measure of me!~
@103  = ~The sodding arrogance of men! If he thinks I’m going to let a scum bag of a lord sit back and think he has the better of me then he’s in for a rude awakening!~
@104  = ~Surprising how the feel of cold steel and the sight of a man’s own blood spurting out of his body will cause him to rethink his ideas but by then of course, he’s as good as dead and doesn’t have a lot of time for this renewed reflection.~
@105  = ~I will help this band of misfits to free your child but only to add insult to injury... I have my own reasons to be paying our lord Firkraag a visit.~
@106  = ~Hey now hold on just a minute! We do you a favour in bringing you these acorns and all you can say is, "the bloody forest welcomes you!" Is that it?~
@107  = ~Look here sister, I’m not over the moon at having to be here... all this sickly sisterly love is making me want to throw up over the lot of you but if it wasn’t for us, your little playmates wouldn’t be here, so how about you answer a couple of questions and then you can get on with your mindless games?~
@108  = ~(*Looking around she shrugs*) Huh... shadow? All this fooling around with those fauns must be making you all blind... Still, I’m betting you’ve been around these parts for some time... tell me, do you recall a man, a human coming here some years ago in search of Lord Firkraag?~
@109  = ~(*Gruffly*) Oh the bastard is dead alright! Just for the record, he was no friend and I am not here to mourn him but if what Firkraag says is true, then this man came in search of knowledge and brought with him gifts, valuable and possibly even magical gifts to pay for that knowledge.~
@110  = ~If it is true! It’s sounding more and more like this Firkraag lied just to get me here. Bah, both men are as despicable and as arrogant as each other. I should have expected no less... men are pathetic!~
@111  = ~It is just possible the two met elsewhere.~
@112  = ~(*Her eyes suddenly flash with anger*) To the abyss with both Firkraag and Dossan! To the abyss with all men, weak pathetic creatures that they are! Why don’t they just face up to it... they are the weaker sex and fuling their ego’s with lies and fantasy won’t change what is?! I’ll have the truth out of him and flay the hide from his back for his arrogance!~
@113  = ~(*Looking at Vaelessa... not even bothering to disguise the disgust in her voice*)... I am about done here anyway! I find your games as you call them, obscene. Whilst you allow your nymphs to frolic and indulge a man’s every whim, how can we as women ever expect to teach the males of this world to acknowledge and respect our superiority?~
@114  = ~Bah... go back to your brainless fauns, I’m sure they are wondering why the chase has been interrupted.~
@115  = ~Helping Irenicus’ captive dryads.

I have returned their acorns to the Fairy Queen, Vaelasa, and the dryads captive in Irenicus’ dungeon have been freed. All have left to plant the acorns and allow their trees to grow once again, and Vaelasa herself expressed both her welcome and gratitude for my deed.~
@116  = ~Why so wizard? Maybe because you know that the women of this world really are the stronger sex and the only way that could be reversed would be by casting all females in the mould of the nymph?~
@117  = ~Well face up to it you pathetic moron, you’re only going to see such a world in your fantasies!~
@118  = ~(*Her fingers begin to twitch and glow slightly as she answers him*) Ho... I heard that! Think on you piece of mule dung, I am not the one wearing a dress here. So if my wearing armour says that about me, what does your choice of attire say about you?~
@119  = ~(*She stills her hands as she glares furiously at the departing wizard’s back*)... You’ll turn your back on me once too often male scum! One of these days you’ll do it and you’ll find an inferno on your tail!~
@120  = ~(*Turns to Leina and snarls*) Yea gods bard, stop encouraging the goon! You’ll have him thinking you want him in your bed the way you’re carrying on. He may not have much of a brain but like all men, he thinks with what he keeps in his breeches!~
@121  = ~Bah... you’d have thought that one would have learnt her lesson. She gets her fingers burnt by a pig headed male and still she sticks up for one of them... it’s not only abhorrent but obscene to see a female behave so pathetically over male scum!~
@122  = ~(*Turns to Melora and snarls*) Yea gods hafling, what are you woman or mouse? Don’t let this male scum here put words into your mouth! Say what you mean... the ranger is a male and like all men, he thinks with what he keeps in his breeches!~
@123  = ~(*She deliberately bends to bring her gaze level with the hafling’s*)... Is this better... I’m down to your level now so you needn’t stretch those stunted legs of yours so hard?~
@124  = ~Give over you two! As much as I would enjoy the sight another time, I’ve not come all this way to watch a cat fight!~
@125  = ~I’ve nothing against you two settling your differences but until we’ve done what we came here to do, I need you both alive.~
@126  = ~Enough, both of you. I need you alive to finish what we started here because I’m damned if I’m going to make the long trek back to the city in order to replace one or the both of you!~
@127  = ~Please, girls... we’ve enough on our plates without fighting amongst ourselves.~
@128  = ~You got lucky this time hafling but don’t get to thinking you’re indispensable. A ten foot pole can easily replace you when it comes to finding and setting off traps. As for locks, most will, eventually, succumb to a good bashing.~
@129  = ~(*Angrily she snarls*) An ambush... why the son of a bitch! The slime ball fights using the coward’s tactics! So be it! If that’s the way he wants it then it’ll be a coward’s death for the male scum!~
@130  = ~(*She looks contemptuously at the orcs and brandishing her sword, sparks flickering as her knuckles*)... Move out of the way... I’ve something here that’ll soon have them squealing like a couple of stuck pigs!~
@131  = ~Bah... orc scum! You’re even bigger cowards than Firkraag. I slit your throats and leave your bloody corpses as a warning not to get in my way.~
@132  = ~I think we’ve scared them enough. Go on, get out of here before I change my mind.~
@133  = ~I’m with you Shar... pick which one you want and I’ll take the other one!~
@134  = ~(*She sneers and with sarcasm in her voice*) Yea well, that’ll sure have Firkraag quaking in his boots! Moron... sparing a couple of orcs like that, you’ve made us look like a lot of pansies!~
@135  = ~You should have done as I said, at least it would have shown these creatures down here that we mean business! Bah, I wonder why I’m still with this group. You make me sick to my stomach, you and your prissy attitude!~
@136  = ~(*Her eyes light up as she gleefully swings her sword*) I’m not fussy... one orc is much the same as another. Just point me at him and watch him bleed.~
@137  = ~This is too easy, we are being toyed with! If it is Firkraag’s intention to put us off our guard by sending menial creatures to meet us, then it is he who has underestimated us... and that will be his undoing!~
@138  = ~(*Scoffs*) Share the booty... who the hell does she think she is kidding?! Her lying tongue was saying one thing but she couldn’t hide the greed in her eyes.~
@139  = ~Should have made her eat steel and taken the bloody key from her! Would have meant one less potential enemy at our backs... Damn <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> need to aid lame ducks! It makes me want to spew up!~
@140  = ~Ha... the treacherous bitch thought to leave us dead and buried in the tomb! Well she’s paid for her arrogance and now she’s the one left to rot down here.~
@141  = ~(*Spitting out her words*) Well, I can’t say that surprised me... treacherous bitch! The arrogance of her, thinking she would get us to do her dirty work and all the time she was plotting murder when it was done...~
@142  = ~I like her style... but she’s paid for her arrogance and now she’s the one left to rot down here!~
@143  = ~(*Stepping in front of the old man*) Not so fast! I haven’t finished with this old man yet. So old man, tell me, how do you come to be locked in with these beasts... run foul of the cowardly Firkraag did you?~
@144  = ~Many years you say... just how 'many' years might that be? Enough to know a great deal about the comings and goings of all his Lordships visitors I’d wager... eh old man?~
@145  = ~Yea, I’ve already been told that but this visitor left. It’s not him I’m interested in, Firkraag should have sent him straight to the abyss for all I care, but what I am interested in are the items this... this man gave to Firkraag in exchange for knowledge. Dossan was his name... Angelo Dossan. Ringing any bells in that senile brain of yours?~
@146  = ~(*Drawing her sword impatiently, she snarles*) Need a little help remembering do we?~
@147  = ~They’re not so little to me so you best start remembering and quick! Besides, if you don’t I’ll take my pleasure in gutting you where you stand... starting here... (*Her eyes glaze over as she jabs the point of  her sword toward his throat and draws it slowly down to his groin... a flicker of flame dancing along her knuckles*)... to here!~
@148  = ~Believe me I know just how to do it so’s a man gets to watch his own entrails as they fall steaming to the ground.~
@149  = ~(*Moving her sword slowly back to his throat the flame vanishes*)... I’ll take that as a compliment. Now, what are you remembering, or do you need a demonstration of just how much I love bloodshed?~
@150  = ~(*Her eyes light up*) Very likely. If Dossan had such items then Firkraag’s vanity alone would cause him to want to own them and a bargain could well have been struck. Tell me, where are they hidden?~
@151  = ~(*She rages... a red hot serpent like flame streaks down her sword*) The bastard... the cowardly bastard! I’ll not only cut his lying tongue from his mouth but I’ll rip his still beating heart from his chest and force him to eat them both for his treachery. Tell me, before you share his fate, what of the thief?~
@152  = ~(*Her eyes burning with rage*) Tell me and you can keep your miserable life, you have my word!~
@153  = ~(*Still gripping her sword*) Umar Hills?! Curses... I gave my word so go, get out of my sight! Consider yourself fortunate that I find little sport in taking the life of one who already walks in death’s shadow. Besides, Firkraag already knows of our presence so you’re in no position to betray us to him.~
@154  = ~I’ll save my rage for the coward himself! As for that scumbag of a thief, he can run but he can’t hide. He’s sure as hell going to regret choosing to run so far, forcing me to back track after him!~
@155  = ~(*Stepping in front of the old man*) Not so fast! I haven’t finished with this old man yet. So you’ve served Firkraag for many years... just how 'many' years might that be? Enough to know a great deal about the comings and goings of all his Lordships visitor’s I’d wager... eh old man?~
@156  = ~Not so fast old man, we’re not done talking yet! The cowardly beast you served told me of a servant who had made off with some of his treasures. Was he speaking the truth or are they still stashed away in this warren somewhere?~
@157  = ~(*Drawing her sword she snarls*) He got what he deserved! Lord, dragon, whatever... the son of a bitch won’t be manipulating anyone again! Now, if you don’t want to join your Lord in the abyss you’ll tell me about this thief!~
@158  = ~This has nothing to do with glory old man and besides, if you don’t start talking I’ll take my pleasure in gutting you where you stand... starting here...~
@159  = ~(*Her eyes glaze over as she jabs her sword at his throat and running it slowly down to his groin... as a barely noticeable small thin flame snakes it’s way down her sword to the point*)... to here! Believe me I know just how to do it so’s a man gets to watch his own entrails as they fall steaming to the ground, just the way your Lord did!~
@160  = ~(*Moving her sword slowly back to his throat*)... Tell me and you can keep your miserable life, you have my word!~
@161  = ~(*Her sword still at his throat*) Umar Hills?! Curses... I gave my word so go, get out of my sight! Consider yourself fortunate that I find little sport in taking the life of one who already walks in death’s shadow.~
@162  = ~As for that scumbag of a thief, he can run but he can’t hide. He’s sure as hell going to regret choosing to run so far, forcing me to back track after him!~
@163  = ~Let’s not be hasty here, the old man may have something to tell us yet. Listen and listen good for your life may well depend on your answer. The dragon who called himself Lord Firkraag is dead, what do you know of him?~
@164  = ~Let’s not be hasty here, the old man may have something to tell us yet. Listen and listen good for your life may well depend on your answer old man. What do you know of the dragon calling himself Lord Firkraag?~
@165  = ~(*Draws her sword*) Oh I think I will! You’re going to tell me all about a thief your Lord claimed ran off with some very special treasures of his, because if you don’t I’ll take my pleasure in gutting you where you stand... starting here.~
@166  = ~(*Her eyes glaze over as she jabs her sword at his throat and running it slowly down to his groin... as a barely noticeable small thin flame snakes it’s way down her sword to the point*)... to here! Believe me I know just how to do it so’s a man gets to watch his own entrails as they fall steaming to the ground.~
@167  = ~Let’s not be hasty here, the old man may have something to tell us yet. Listen and listen good for your life may well depend on your answer old man. Exactly how much were you privy to the dragon’s dealings?~
@168  = ~(*Sneering*) Don’t flatter yourself! You forget, it was a red dragon I had in mind to find when first I set out on my quest. So whereas discovering you to be that dragon was unexpected, I find you no more intimidating than I would a gnat!~
@169  = ~Ho, not so fast you scaly lizard. I am not done with you. How much do you value you reputation... enough to trade a few trinkets to stop others of your kind knowing how a human wrangled knowledge from you for the cost of a few paltry items?~
@170  = ~You’ll not dismiss me that easily, and don’t think I’ll be put off by a few puffs of smoke either! Give me what I have tramped this stinking dungeon for, and maybe I’ll leave your ugly great head atop that scaley carcass of yours!~
@171  = ~(*Sparks appear at her finger tips as she reaches for her sword*) So your cowardly servant spoke the truth! Listen you overheated heap of lizard dung I’m not about to leave empty handed! If I can’t take what I came for, then  I’ll take your treacherous heart, preferably still beating, for wasting my time!~
@172  = ~(*Sparks appear at her finger tips as she reaches for her sword*) What! You lie you overheated heap of lizard dung! I’ll not leave empty handed, either you hand them over or I’ll take your treacherous heart, preferably still beating, for wasting my time!~
@173  = ~Now your talking! The feel of cold steel in the belly will quell any embers lurking inside this steaming heap of lizard dung’s innards!~
@174  = ~(*Her eyes flash with anger as she sheathes her sword*)...~
@175  = ~This isn’t over lizard, not by a long way! I know something of the items I seek, you were foolish to allow them to be taken from you. Mark my words, my sword WILL drink of your blood... just not today!~
@176  = ~(*Angrily*) You mean to bargain with this creature, even though he played you for the fool? Bah... it’s plain to see why you are so often easily duped! Hear him out if you must and while you’re at it ask him why he so anxious for the return of these items?~
@177  = ~(*To herself as she tightens her grip around the hilt of her sword*) When I find it, no one, and I mean NO ONE other than me is going to be putting a hand on my property. Any one who tries to put it back into the filthy claws of that creature will feel my sword tickling their innards!~
@178  = ~(*Stabbing her sword into the bloody carcase of the dragon*) Ha, see how easily the mighty has fallen... see how the dirt beneath the stones eagerly drink its blood. So much blood... and so, those who dare trifle with me as this creature... so shall they share the same fate.~
@179  = ~(*Scoffs*) Bah, this thief must have a brain the size of a pea if he thought himself safe here! How did the pathetic little man expect to remain hidden here? Still, he is a man and they never think with their mind!~
@180  = ~(*Turning to Esmond*) Don’t try and *orc dung* me you male dog! I know you for who you are you cowardly mongrel, the stench of the wyrm clings to you still! All the years spent crawling behind in his filth has left you smelling as foul as your master!~
@181  = ~(*Her eyes flash*) I’m no one’s servant. Another insinuation that I am and your innards will find themselves hugging steel! I am here to claim that which is mine by right, that which you stole from the wyrm.~
@182  = ~(*Sparks leap at her finger tips as she makes to grab for the hilt of her sword*) Jumped up, who are you calling jumped up you heap of orc’s dung! I’ll show you jumped up...~
@183  = ~Ye gods, what were you thinking of, <CHARNAME>?! You should have just let me cut the bastard’s throat. It’s not like anyone was going to miss the pathetic dog, and not to mention our purse is now unnecessarily lighter.~
@184  = ~Shut up Shar-Teel! You got what you wanted and it’s not like we couldn’t afford the gold!~
@185  = ~It is for me to decide what we do with our gold so stop whining and try to be grateful for once in your life.~
@186  = ~I don’t share your love for bloodshed Shar-Teel. If gold was what it took for a peaceful outcome then I consider it gold well spent.~
@187  = ~Yea well, don’t expect me to hang around when you’re hiring out as mercenaries again, or clearing the sewers of vermin because you’ve given our hard earned gold to every lost cause we meet.~
@188  = ~Mark my words, I have no intentions of living in poverty ever again.~
@189  = ~Neither do I so you’ve nothing to fear from my extravagances. Now can we quit yammering and get out of here!~
@190  = ~You’ll do whatever you have to do regardless, Shar-Teel, so let’s drop it for now and get  out of here!~
@191  = ~Just telling you so’s that you know should I go, all that’s mine goes with me, and I’ll skewer anyone who so much as raises a hand to stop me!~
@192  = ~(*Wiping her blood stained boot in the dirt, she sneers*) What do I care for your words! I care only for actions, not self righteous recriminations after the deed is done.~
@193  = ~Mine are, after all, not the only hands stained in blood, or hadn’t you cared to take a look at yourselves? I thought not!~
@194  = ~Bah, spare me the hypocrisy , you all make me want to throw up!~
@195  = ~(*Scoffs*) Listen to yourself, your dead father would turn in his grave if he could hear you talk!~
@196  = ~No, he’d probably jump right out of it and strike you down himself for shaming him! You’ve not got the balls to be worthy of the name *murder*!~
@197  = ~Just beware of that acid tongue of yours my girl. The worm may yet turn and prove you wrong!~
@198  = ~Whatever Shar-Teel, I am the child of murder and no amount of petty jealousy on your part will make it otherwise!~
@199  = ~Nowhere is it written that the child should follow the father. I am my own person and proud to be so.~
@200  = ~Bah, sometimes your attitude makes me sick to my stomach. Only time will tell whether you make something of yourself or die pitifully in the attempt. Just don’t count on me hanging around to keep backing you up.~
@201  = ~(*Her eyes flash with anger*) What in the nine hells! How look where your bloody incompetence has gotten me!~
@202  = ~I’ll... I’ll flay you alive! No flaying’s too good for you. I’ll toast you in the biggest fireball I can muster, that way I get you and this pathetic group of yours in one go!~
@203  = ~(*Her hands move, sparks already beginning to dance at her finger tips*)~
@204  = ~Shar-Teel, stop now or I swear, you’ll not live long enough to raise that fireball!!~
@205  = ~Shar-Teel think, it’ll take us but a second to surround you and you’ll be caught in your own fireball.~
@206  = ~Shar-Teel, NO! (*Then taking one look at the fire growing in her hands you attack Shar-Teel*)~
@207  = ~(*Snarling, she looks at you and her fingers stop weaving*) I’ll not allow your bungling or my temper to be my downfall. I will find the male scum again, without your hindrance!~
@208  = ~You can forget our deal. I curse the day I ever thought you worthy of my service. Now get out of my way.~
@209  = ~This is no one’s fault. I didn’t know he was capable of teleporting and I’m sure you didn’t either. Just pull your head in and put it down to experience! ~
@210  = ~Whereas I don’t appreciate all your bad mouthing, you have proven yourself invaluable to the group so won’t you reconsider and stay?~
@211  = ~You are my most valuable companion... and trustfull friend. There’s so much we passed together, and you have always bravely fought at my side. Please don't leave me now.~
@212  = ~I’ve just about had it with all your bad mouthing! So just go and good riddance!~
@213  = ~Never!! Know that should our paths ever cross again, for whatever reason, then you best keep walking or by the nine hells I’ll finish what I started here, and that’s a promise!~
@214  = ~I hope never to see you or this worthless band of cretins again, but should our paths ever cross again, for whatever reason, then you best keep walking or by the nine hells I’ll finish what I started here, and that’s a promise!~
@215  = ~Bah, spare me the hypocrisy, you make me want to throw up!~
@216  = ~Pathetic fools.~
@217  = ~(*Sternly*) Let us not gloat on what has occurred here Shar-Teel. ~
@218  = ~Bah, I hardly broke a sweat there! How’s a hero supposed to build a reputation when he’s forced to waste time on petty skirmishes?!~
@219  = ~Look to yourself hafling. I don’t see you up front unless it entails sneaking around in the shadows!~
@220  = ~What do you think you’re in this group for you half wit? You suss out the threat and the rest of the group take point in order to let me muster my magic and take the enemy out before any serious damage befalls you all.~
@221  = ~(*Turning away*) Tsk... What other reason does she think she’s here for? Her charismatic attraction?!~
@222  = ~Never I’d say if the hero in question is yourself gnome. Heroes don’t stay at the back tossing trifling spells around, they take point with swords in their hands.~
@223  = ~And how many times has my sneaking around as you call it, saved your hide from an ambush or from a particularly nasty trap, more times than you can count I’ll wager!~
@224  = ~(*Stops and turns back... his fiery glare meeting the equally cold gaze of Shar-Teel*)... That would not be a wise move. Let me warn you girl...~
@225  = ~(*He stops and looks closer at the girl, his eyes suddenly seem to glow*)... Well now, what do we have here? Dossan leaves an heir I see... what do they call you girl?~
@226  = ~(*A bemused look comes to his face*)... What ever name you go by, I recognise the father’s eyes looking out from the daughter’s face... eyes as dark and pitiless as those of Angelo Dossan’s are not easily forgotten.~
@227  = ~(*He laughs*)... Ah the fierceness and spirit of youth... how well I remember it! You truly are your father’s daughter Shar-Teel... yes you are known to me.~
@228  = ~Does that surprise you? Or are you perhaps wondering why I bothered asking your name when I already knew it? It was out of politeness, nothing more than politeness... after all, we hadn’t been properly introduced had we?~
@229  = ~You see, there’s not a lot that gets past the eyes and ears of my servants. I knew our paths were destined to cross some day and my kin are renowned for their patience.~
@230  = ~Not so fast young lady. Look around you, are you so certain that the one you seek isn’t here? Would you even know him if you saw him?~
@231  = ~(*A sly smile plays around the corners of his mouth*) Then I apologise for my presumptuousness in thinking that you were looking for the one who taught your father in order to take back that with which he paid for his knowledge. Ah... a most excellent pupil he was too, devious but gifted.~
@232  = ~(*Sharply interrupting her*) Whatever you may have heard, Angelo Dossan came to me for instruction. I was his teacher and all that he was he owed to me. Mind you, he paid handsomely for his knowledge!~
@233  = ~When first he approached me I was amused by the man’s audacity, but it wasn’t long before I saw a kindred spirit in him. A man whose quick and devious mind came second only to my own.~
@234  = ~So I undertook to teach him a fraction of what I know, but it was enough and he left content... besides, it had been a while since anyone had plucked up nerve enough to seek me out. No one has sparked my interest or deemed themselves worthy of my notice since.~
@235  = ~(*Smirks*) Looks can be deceptive my girl... believe me when I say you’ll not find me an easy target for that sword of yours!~
@236  = ~Besides, kill me and you’ll never see your father’s legacy.~
@237  = ~Do as I ask, free my lands of the intruders that I spoke of and then you will have that which you seek... Shar-Teel Dossan.~
@238  = ~(*A look of concern crosses the man’s face*) Please, don’t underestimate him young woman, you’ve seen the trickery he is capable of and you can be sure he won’t have sent his best lackeys to execute so menial a task as kidnapping.~
@239  = ~No, as well as arrogant, he’s extremely ruthless in his dealings with men. These people were expendable, just like any who choose to serve him.~
@240  = ~Even now he knows that you have taken up his challenge... he is toying with you as a cat toys with a mouse before the kill. I beg you, no matter how much he goads you, you must not give him the satisfaction of starting the fight!~
@241  = ~He fears no one but it serves his vanity to let it be known that should you die, he will have acted in self defence and can not be called to account for your deaths. Not that anyone would dare challenge him on that account.~
@242  = ~(*Shaking his head sadly*) You will not heed my warning! I have tried, what more can I say except, please be wary and remember that all is not as it seems in these parts... as you well know? May the gods watch over you, may they bring you and my child safely through this ordeal.~
@243  = ~Rescue Garren’s child from Firkraag.

Garren’s child has been kidnapped, no doubt by Firkraag’s men. Garren has convinced the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart of my innocence, so I am free once again to travel without being hounded by paladins bent on vengeance. Garren doesn’t know why Firkraag would continue to hound him... nor where his child’s kidnappers would have taken their prisoner.~
@244  = ~Is it recompense for your time that you seek sister?~
@245  = ~Nay, my mistake! I should not call you sister, for there is a darkness about you. Its roots stem from deep within your heart.~
@246  = ~Go, leave this place for only goodness and light may tarry among us.~
@247  = ~You are right, whatever your heart, you have done us a great service in returning Ulene, Cania and Elyme to us. Ask your questions but make them quick for your darkness casts a shadow over this place.~
@248  = ~(*Shaking her head sadly*) There have been many come in search of him but none have of them ever leave. So if you are searching for your friend I am sorry for he is surely dead.~
@249  = ~He brought gifts... you say this man brought magical gifts for Lord Firkraag? Never have I known such a thing! Men have come in order to seek glory or revenge but to bring gifts? (*She laughs softly*)...~
@250  = ~Knowing his nature and his greed, that may well have amused him... a man laying gifts at his feet, yes that would indeed have amused our Lord Firkgraag but I am sorry, I don’t recall such a person ever coming here.~
@251  = ~(*Shuddering*) I will answer no more of your questions, nor I will allow your rancour to despoil this place! So I must ask you to leave lest you taint it beyond redemption and our games are spoilt for ever!~
@252  = ~Yours is another race that blights the surface. That you are beautiful is not in dispute, but the way you use your looks to beguile and capture the hearts of men is obscene. It sickens me to my stomach to see females fawn over and indulge the male his fantasies the way that you do... regardless of his race!~
@253  = ~Speak fer yerself girly. I don’t see nowt wrong in chasing a comely lass, ‘specially if she lets ‘erself get caught! Just ya yell if ya wants a real man to catch yer, ol Korgan is always willing to oblige the ladies.~
@254  = ~Ol’ Jan here has had his share of chasing a pretty nymph or two and I’m telling you, to catch and be rewarded by a kiss from one of these fair creatures blows the socks clean off your feet.~
@255  = ~A distant cousin of Uncle Willie found this to be true when he was walking past such goings on and some poor sods boots came flying and hit him in the head, followed closely by the fellow’s socks. It weren’t the boots that knocked this cousin unconscious, it were the stench of those socks, the fellow had been wearing them a twelve month at least!~
@256  = ~Delightful creatures, absolutely delightful. It’s a shame the gods didn’t stick to this design when creating females of the other races.~
@257  = ~And what world, may I ask, would you be living in... not the real one that’s for sure? Your delusions appear to have conjured up an imaginary world and now your poor, weak female brain actually believes you are living in this illusion! [Poor girl, she really believes that because she wears armour and can use a sword adequately, she is as good as a man.]~
@258  = ~Oh do stop that with your fingers... I could, if I so desired it, hurl a fireball at you before you’ve managed to summon as much as a spark!~
@259  = ~Before you go casting further aspersions as to my character you would do well to remember that... the wearing of the red robe is a prestigious form of dress that marks my brethren and myself as a very powerful force.~
@260  = ~Red was chosen as a warning that we are not to be messed with... not for its colourfulness. Now go away and practice doing something useful with those fingers of yours... like maybe lighting the camp fires!~
@261  = ~I’ll have you know that I have entertained and been entertained by many intelligent as well as beautiful women. There is just something graceful... sensual about a nymph that is not found in women of any other race. [Not that an ungainly half breed such as she would understand ’sensual’ or ’graceful’.]~
@262  = ~That can not be so Melora. Minsc always thinks with his mind, sometimes he thinks so hard all the thinking gives him big headaches. Ask Boo, he knows how much Minsc’s head hurts sometimes. Right Boo?~ [BOONEJ1]
@263  = ~(*A huge smile spreads across the ranger’s face*)... Oooo thank you Leina, you say such nice things and make Minsc feel all fuzzy.~
@264  = ~(*A huge smile spreads across the ranger’s face*)... Ooo, thank you Melora. Boo says to tell Melora that the group would not be the same without her pretty face and happy smiles... and Minsc, as always, agrees with Boo.~
@265  = ~Pleeze, mercy on us! Me sorry. Don’t kill. Me just following orders. Didn’t want to eat children or kick old people. Just job!~
@266  = ~Foul orc! You will suffer the same fate as all your kind!~
@267  = ~Flee from here, foul creature, and never harm another!~
@268  = ~Cowardly creature, have some dignity in death even if you had none in life.~
@269  = ~(*His face blanches with fear*) Loo... loo... look please, we like it here, aint that so Flaylan? We don’t interfere with the lord’s business and if ya have a brain then ya’d run and forget what ya come here for aint that right Flaylan?~
@270  = ~Com’on, Flaylan, we run! I not want to be around when lord Firkraag frazzles this lot. You wait and see, you all gonna get it good and proper.~
@271  = ~Lord Jierdan says the daughter would follow the father, and he’s always right. Fool girl, ya don’t know what ya be up against... none of youse do! Enuff to say s’no shame to turn back now, run whilst ya still can.~
@272  = ~He sure you gonna die. Me sure too. Me sure I should run other way so I not killed too by accident. He get mad, bad things happen.~
@273  = ~Rescue Garren’s child from Firkraag.

Inside Firkraag’s dungeon I have encountered a woman by the name of Samia... a relic hunter, of sorts, who is searching for texts relating to a dead Tethyrian king. I have agreed to take her key and find the texts she needs from the king’s burial chamber... which is supposedly protected by a mysterious, invisible creature, the last of seven guardians, according to the legends. Once I have the texts I am to return to Samia.~
@274  = ~Samia’s plan foiled.

Samia, the relic hunter in Firkraag’s dungeon, was not what she seemed. Her plan was to get a dupe to get the treasure within the tomb for her... and then kill whomever retrieved it with the help of her companions. Fortunately, she has paid for her arrogance.~
@275  = ~Now what about you my little firecracker, you still looking to take on Lord Firkraag or do you now find my true form a little... shall we say... intimidating?~
@276  = ~Brave words but I suspect they are more for the benefit of your friends’ ears than mine. Now be a good little girl and go wrest the Windspear brat from Conster before he toasts it! I am done with you.~
@277  = ~(*Small puffs of smoke leave the dragon’s nostrils*) Don’t you mess with me girl... I’ll not look as kindly on the daughter as I did the father!~
@278  = ~Dossan intrigued me and that is the only reason I tolerated his presence... you however, do not! Believe me when I say you do not want to test my patience nor do you want to feel the full fury of a dragon’s wrath!~
@279  = ~Now go away and leave me to ponder on more important matters.~
@280  = ~You are either very brave or very foolish... like father like daughter it would seem.~
@281  = ~Well, daughter of Dossan, know that I could have wrested those trinkets from your father easily, but his naiveness and audacity in thinking he could bargain with me was... well, shall we say... refreshing.~
@282  = ~Besides, it gave me the opportunity to experience the emotion you humans call benevolence. Living as long as we do, my kin like to experience all that there is to experience... including all the emotions of your other races.~
@283  = ~Strange, the only thing I felt was a bad taste in my mouth. Not a pleasant experience at all and certainly not one I intend to repeat. Anyway, I no longer have the items you speak of so, if it is your intention to save the brat child then I suggest you do so quickly, Conster is not a man to be kept waiting.~
@284  = ~(*Small flames dance menacingly from his tongue as he speaks*) Ho, not so fast my fiery maiden... if it’s a heated confrontation you want I am more than willing to oblige.~
@285  = ~You are a credit to Dossan. In fact you would make any dragon proud to have sired you. A temper such as yours could be nurtured to reach untold heights.~
@286  = ~The fool Dossan didn’t know what he had spawned, you do him proud, daughter of Dossan, but before you do anything foolish which will surely lead to your death, I have a proposition to put to you and this little group. What say you <CHARNAME>, are you up for bargaining?~
@287  = ~Ye gods woman... we’re not set up to take down a dragon! Hold that temper of yours and let’s get out of here whilst we can.~
@288  = ~He’ll keep Shar-Teel. I’m not about to strike a bargain with this creature, nor do I wish a confrontation until I am ready. We’re leaving... and I mean now!~
@289  = ~Put your sword away Shar-Teel. I want to hear his offer.~
@290  = ~That temper of yours will be the death of us yet! Ah what the heck, nothing ventured nothing gained. Let’s make this quick... before he has chance to stoke that fiery breath of his.~
@291  = ~(*His nostrils flare*) Be quiet girl, you are not the one making decisions here!~
@292  = ~(*Turning his attention back to you*) My proposition is one that should not prove too difficult to a capable person such as yourself. If you find and bring to me the thief... No, come to think of it, I have no need of the thief, his body will suffice.~
@293  = ~Bring me the traitor’s body and all that he stole from me, and I shall reward you with riches beyond anything you can imagine. What say you child of Bhaal?~
@294  = ~I can imagine plenty... still I never say no to more. Where might I find this thief?~
@295  = ~I don’t care much for treachery myself. Tell me where the coward is hiding and Ill dispatch him for you.~
@296  = ~I am no common assassin, but tell me where this thief can be found and maybe if I’m passing, I’ll have a word with him on your behalf.~
@297  = ~What does she mean... why the concern over these particular trinkets when you are clearly sitting on a sizable hoard already?~
@298  = ~I can imagine plenty, still I never say no to more... The Umar Hills I believe is where Durbin says he is holed up.~
@299  = ~I don’t care much for treachery myself. Durbin has already told me where to find this thief... the coward will find no quarter among the trees.~
@300  = ~I am no common assassin, but if I happen to pass through this forest that Durbin mentioned, then I’ll maybe have a word with him on your behalf.~
@301  = ~Hm... now there is my dilemma... you see if I knew where the traitor was holed up I wouldn’t be needing your services now would I?~
@302  = ~The last sighting of the coward was somewhere in the forest, far north of this place but he has evaded all my endeavours to track him to his hole. My guess is he is long gone by now, and my property lost with him.~
@303  = ~You child of Bhaal, have a long journey ahead of you before you find your place in the scheme of things, but you might just run into him somewhere along this strange path of yours. I am a patient being, age has taught me both patience and wisdom and that it is better to take one’s time when seeking to overcome life’s little hiccups... impetuosity often as not ends with one’s demise.~
@304  = ~So I will not rush you in this matter... but if your lust for riches spurs you into action and you return quickly, I am sure I can find a magical item or two around here to show my appreciation. Do we have a bargain... and I suggested you decide quickly as I know Conster is anxious to relinquish his role as babysitter.~
@305  = ~Yea gods... you too! Am I the only one around here who doesn’t know my *path* as you call it? We must talk some more about that when I’ve dealt with your thief.~
@306  = ~The forest far north of here, not a lot to go on seeing as it’s nearly all forest in that direction. Still, you can start counting out that reward, I’ll soon flush the traitor out.~
@307  = ~He’s as good as dead... just you keep that soon to be hoard of mine warm!~
@308  = ~I don’t think so... I’ll just relieve you of that hoard that you’re sitting on as payment for wasting my time.~
@309  = ~Yes... well... let’s not be getting ahead of ourselves. If you do manage to find my possessions, then and only then dare you venture back into my presence. If you are foolhardy enough to attempt to gain entry without them, I will see this as an assault on myself and will act accordingly.~
@310  = ~(*Yawning*) Now go... we are done talking. Remember my warning and return only when you have completed your part of our bargain.~
@311  = ~Yes, and along the way I have lost both talon and tooth to win such prizes. I’ll not relinquish so easily that which has cost me. No matter whether I paid with talon or knowledge, the price was paid and by rights the *trinkets* are mine.~
@312  = ~What ever they may or may not be is neither here nor there... they are mine and I simply wish them returned to me. In return I have offered you wealth beyond your imagining and be assured, I’ll not repeat such an offer again... so what is your answer?~
@313  = ~I don’t care much for treachery myself. Tell me where the coward is hiding and I’ll dispatch him for you.~
@314  = ~Durbin... yes... the name is vaguely familiar to me, but then I have had so many servants over the centuries I can’t be expected to remember one name out of so many.~
@315  = ~I have sent my servants to explore each and every sighting of him, and for all my pains they return empty handed. My guess is he is long gone by now, and my property lost with him.~
@316  = ~You child of Bhaal, have a long journey ahead of you before you find your place in the scheme of things, but you might just run into him somewhere along this strange path of yours. I am a patient being, age has taught me both patience and wisdom and that it is better to take one’s time when seeking to overcome life’s little hiccups... impetuosity often as not ends in death.~
@317  = ~So I will not rush you in this matter... but if your lust for riches spurs you into action and you return quickly, I am sure I can find a magical item or two around here to show my appreciation. Do we have a bargain.... and I suggested you decide quickly as I know Conster is anxious to relinquish his role as babysitter.~
@318  = ~It’s a pretty big forest to hide in, it’s just possible your servants didn’t look long enough. No matter, you can start counting out that reward, I’ll soon flush the traitor out.~
@319  = ~Hold your tongue you black hearted vixen! Khalid was a gentle man and it’s true he loathed to fight but that didn’t make him any  less a man.~
@320  = ~He would have sacrificed his life for any one of his friends... you have no idea of the gentle and loving heart that beat in his breast. I find your words both cruel and contemptuous Shar-Teel.~
@321  = ~Devil spawn... I should strike you down where you stand for your callousness!~
@322  = ~My hand is stayed because I know Khalid and if he were looking down on this scene, his gentle heart would be saddened to think he were the cause of yet more blood to stain my hands.~
@323  = ~For his sake, this time my weapon is stilled... next time it may not be!~
