@31   = ~Oh enough with your horse play! Leina always wants a hot bath let’s get the jump on her first this time. What say you?~
@32   = ~Sssssh. Now listen Leina always wants a bath after a battle and she hasn’t said anything yet so let’s do it first.~

@40   = ~Korgan, language! Try and remember where we are. Leina, did this dwarf cause you to holler?~
@41   = ~You're all talk Korgan. I should have known better. You'd be holding a stump right now if you had, and I doubt anyone here would be too willing to sew it back on. So, Leina, why your outburst?~
@42   = ~Holler?~
