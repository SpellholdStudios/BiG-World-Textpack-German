@0    = ~<CHARNAME> has brought me no pain, spirit.  Quite the contrary.~
@1    = ~You are not Merella! I talked to Merella before she died... We have put it to rest, we...~
@2    = ~I had been there when you died, Merella! Valygar did all he could to save you. He does not deserve these wild accusations!~
@3    = ~Gorion, what are you doing? Valygar did nothing to deserve this torture!~
@4    = ~Valygar, do not you see that they are lying? They are liars and pretenders!~
@5    = ~I’m not very qualified to advise you, <CHARNAME>.  I’ve never been very comfortable with power.  The thought of attracting the attention of other gods, some who might be jealous, would not sit very well with me.~
@6    = ~<CHARNAME>... I know the choice is before you, and you alone. And it may not be fair of me to try to influence you. But please, stay who you are. Stay what you are. Do not let Bhaal take you away. I...I love who you are... I find myself afraid that I might not have the chance to say this again if I do not say it now: I LOVE YOU.~
@7    = ~You wish to face the taint of Bhaal forever?  It will eat away at you... if you do not embrace it willingly.  Make your own destiny would be my advice... do not rest in your sire’s shadow.~ [VALY2517]
@8    = ~But I know that you’ll make the best decision.  You always have in the past, and I trust that you always will in the future.  You laugh at me for such confidence, but I believe it.  You are unique beyond anyone I have ever encountered.~
@9    = ~If you stay with me, I can only offer the solace of my company.  I would love to continue our journeys together... there is much that we could still do, many places we could go.~
@10   = ~But if you leave, that doesn’t mean I will love you any less, <CHARNAME>.  I will remember you, and hope that the power you gain will make you happy.~
@11   = ~If you’ve taught me anything, it’s that power isn’t something to always fear.  I only hope that the life you choose isn’t one you regret.  As for me... our time together has been worth everything.~
@12   = ~I love you as well.  I wouldn’t blame you for not wanting the power and the taint of your sire... but I would ask you to reconsider if you were to refuse it simply to remain with me, <CHARNAME>.~
@13   = ~Truly?  I could not see myself deciding the same.  To attract the attention of the gods with such power would not sit well with me, although the idea of exploring the planes is attractive, I’ll admit.~
@14   = ~<CHARNAME>, you... how could you... I wish I could curse the day I met you, nightingale. But this day is my pain and my bliss and I grew to cherish it. That’s how love always is, I wager. At least that had been my experience... (*He turns and walks away.*)~
@15   = ~It takes a great person to achieve godhood, yet it takes a true hero to reject it. <CHARNAME>, what you have done is an act of grandeur. You have destroyed the Bhaal essence within you and you have resisted the temptation to take his place in the pantheon. Let me kneel before you... I will worship you to the end of my days.~
@16   = ~Get up, you idiot. Or I swear I’ll take you on a trip to Ust-Natha... I love you and all I want is to spend my life with you.~
@17   = ~Valygar, what do you say we go to the Docks and look for a ship sailing to Zakhara?~
@18   = ~But if I would become a goddess, I would not get a chance to tell the most stubborn, impossible, ill-mannered ranger on Faerun, that I love him.~
@19   = ~My heart, we do not have to travel to the Underdark. I love you and I cannot hide my feelings, even if I wanted to.  I will prove you my love and my loyalty... Kiss me <CHARNAME>...~
@20   = ~What if we leave it for a bit later? I have other plans for right now, and I want to start with kissing you. I swear by the first day of Toril and by its last day, I swear by the pain of death and by the joy of life, I swear I love you and I will never give you a reason to regret the choice you have made today.~
@21   = ~I am glad you took a chance on me. I swear by the first day of Toril and by its last day, I swear by the pain of death and by the joy of life, I swear I love you and I will never give you a reason to regret the choice you have made today.~
@22   = ~Merella?~
@23   = ~What are you talking about, Merella? I came back just as I promised, and you... you were engaged to another man!~
@24   = ~Merella that is not true! I loved you then, if you only spoke to me, we could have...~
@25   = ~Valygar had been almost everything for you: a man you hunted, a reluctant ally, a comrade at arms, a friend... Through thick and thin you went together and now you suspect that he is about to become your lover as well.~
@26   = ~You brush  past Valygar, "accidentally" making your hips  touch...~
@27   = ~You kiss Valygar lightly on the cheek: "Thank you for being with me after all that happened."~
@28   = ~You whisper into Valygar’s ear: "I think I really need a hug..."~
@29   = ~You sigh in exasperation: the days’ trials are starting to weigh upon you.~
@30   = ~You close your eyes and enjoy the silence for a moment after the ring of steel on steel and the cries of the last battle.~
@31   = ~You hold Valygar’s hand.~
@32   = ~For a brief moment Valygar’s arm embraces your waist, and he pulls you closer. Then, reluctantly he lets you go.~
@33   = ~Valygar takes you face in his hands: "<CHARNAME>, I am honored by the trust you have shown me."~
@34   = ~The ranger throws his hands around you, and he presses you tightly against his chest: "Do you feel better now, <CHARNAME>?"~
@35   = ~Valygar starts to sing in a low voice a stupid, bawdy song which goes something like:
  
"Then we shall drink some ale, 
To make our life a bliss
Though even ale of course
Here tastes like piss..."

~
@36   = ~You feel a light touch of lips on you forehead and hear Valygar’s soft voice: "Please, do not look so sad."~
@37   = ~Valygar’s fingers intertwine with yours and he says: "Now I have caught you sweetling."~
@38   = ~The world swirls around you. You feel that since the day you left Candlekeep with Gorion you were sure of nothing.~
@39   = ~You announce to your group: "My friends, I feel a bit uneasy and wish for some... rest. Please, take a break. Will you walk with me, Valygar?"~
@40   = ~Ignoring everyone you give Valygar a deep, long kiss.~
@41   = ~You smile at Valygar gently.~
@42   = ~You ask the ranger quietly: "Do you remember the last night, Valygar?"~
@43   = ~You trace Valygar’s face with your fingers: "Here is the strong jaw which tells me that you are a stubborn man, wide cheekbones - that’s because of some wild blood in your veins, high temples - must have come from your noble ancestors..."~
@44   = ~"Valygar, we are going to make it, won’t we?"~
@45   = ~As everyone else is out of view and earshot, Valygar showers you with passionate kisses: "I am so glad you have done that, <CHARNAME>. Another minute and I would go mad from walking by you and not being able to touch you."~
@46   = ~"Ah... Crazy woman..."~
@47   = ~Valygar returns your smile and whispers: "You are so beautiful..."~
@48   = ~"Remember? I cannot think about anything else but the last night... or the night to come."~
@49   = ~"It is my turn now." His fingers caress your face and touch your lips: "Those lips were made of smiles and for kisses..."~
@50   = ~"I don’t know, but what I can promise you that I shall protect you from any harm until I live."~
