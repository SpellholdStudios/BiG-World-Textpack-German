@0    = ~Sime Linvail... I was afraid that I would never see you again.~
@1    = ~What is there to understand? I came to ask you why did you kill me?~
@2    = ~Recklessness... Darling, I only became reckless, when I understood that you would give your heart to anyone, but me.~
@3    = ~But you did not love me. Funny how it still hurts to see you with another <PRO_MANWOMAN>... just like it did in life.~
@4    = ~And I loved you madly. I loved you so much that I did not want to live if you did not return my feelings... so I chose to fight as I was a berserker... sooner or later I knew that the death will find me...~
