@2    = ~(*A little flustered*) I didn’t mean to imply that there was anything inappropriate in your suggestion Leina. I know that you...~
@3    = ~My lady, you've been on the road for more than a year now. Do you miss Candlekeep perchance? You must have led a quiet and ordained life there.~
@4    = ~Yes, I miss it. I'd rather describe my life in Candlekeep as carefree. Gorion took care of everything, and I just had to study. It's a shame that I did not understand it back then.~
@5    = ~Do I miss it? A bit... Imoen and I would just fall asleep in the library or look for ways to skip our classes.~
@6    = ~The walls of Candlekeep made me feel completely safe. When everything... changed it proved to be quite a shock.~
@7    = ~(With a sad smile) This is common to all children, my lady. They rarely appreciate parental care.~
@8    = ~Do you have children, sir Keldorn?~
@9    = ~At times Gorion was a terrible bore though.~
@10   = ~Yes, I do, so I am speaking from experience. What of your friend? Is she anything like you?~
@11   = ~Oh, no... She is a small quick thief, very pretty and smart too, funny and mischievous.~
@12   = ~She is nothing like me. She has a sharp tongue, asking to be silenced. Back in Candlekeep days, she'd report what each monk had in his pockets. But I miss the brat.~
@13   = ~Heh, Imoen... She's so small and dexterous that she'd squeeze through any hole. Funny too, dyed her hair pink and all... Where would I be, if not for her...~
@14   = ~(Frowns) A thief...~
@15   = ~After Gorion's death she turned her quick mind to magic... that's the reason she got herself arrested.~
@16   = ~Ah, yes, I forgot. The wizards are quite out of control, indeed.~
@17   = ~But he taught you a lot, my lady. What of this Imoen...is she anything like you?~
@18   = ~Oh, no... She is a small dexterous thief, very pretty and smart too, funny and mischievous.~
@19   = ~Yes, I understand you so well... Do tell me of your friend. Is she anything like you?~
@20   = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, have I told you that I live in the Government District?~
@21   = ~My attendance at the Order is... it is oft required, but my servants maintain an estate in this district and it is there that I visit my wife and daughters.~
@22   = ~I would love to offer you the hospitality of my manor, moreover that I am curious to hear the tales of your doings in Baldur's Gate. Would you like to come? I shall introduce you.~
@23   = ~But, sir Keldorn, I could tell you the tales in an inn or by the campfire...~
@24   = ~I'm... not sure, we are hardly acquainted, it's just not appropriate.~
@25   = ~That would be wonderful, my lord!~
@26   = ~Would that be appropriate? I doubt that your family would be happy if we barged into your house.~
@27   = ~You must be missing your family? You could always spend a night at home and meet us at the inn in the morning.~
@28   = ~No thanks, sir Keldorn. It is not my place to intrude upon your personal life.~
@29   = ~I was born in Esmeltaran, but Athkatla has long been my home. My tasks for the Church too often keep me away, but my estate is in this district, along with my wife and daughters.~
@30   = ~Nonsense. I would love to offer you the hospitality of my manor, moreover that I am curious to hear the tales of your doings in Baldur's Gate.~
@31   = ~My estate is in this district, along with my wife and daughters. I am sure they would love to meet you. Come, and I shall make the necessary introductions.~
@32   = ~My lady, aren't you getting tired of staying at inns?~
@33   = ~(With a guilty smile) I am...~
@34   = ~Sir, this is not about my preferences, though...~
@35   = ~I'm not comfortable with your offer anyway.~
@36   = ~You are correct, my lord.~
@37   = ~<CHARNAME>, why are you looking so abashed? We are comrades at arms after all is said and done. We could use this opportunity to get to know each other. Be at ease, everything will be fine.~
@38   = ~I shall point it out to you as we pass its gates. As I said, it has been far too long since last I walked these streets.~
@39   = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has become anxious to visit his estate and family in the Government District of Athkatla.  I get the feeling that if I do not go with him, soon, he will decide to go by himself.~
@40   = ~Be at ease. My daughters would probably be interested, and my wife, well... she is used to this.~
@41   = ~I am not sure... If I were in her shoes, I wouldn't like it. You don't visit them too often, do you?~
@42   = ~(With a laugh) Do you always bring home your company?~
@43   = ~(Smirks) Not every day, no. My assignments keep me away. Come along, my friends? I shall point it out to you as we pass its gates. As I said, it has been far too long since last I walked these streets.~
@44   = ~Keldorn wishes to visit his wife and family.

Keldorn has become anxious to return to his estate in Athkatla... apparently, he has not seen his family in over a season.  I have agreed to go with him.  His estate can be found in the Government District, and Keldorn will point it out when we pass.~
@45   = ~Not always, but it happens from time to time. You can verify that should you wish, my lady.~
@46   = ~No-no. It is no good at all. We belong to the same company and should board together. One never knows what could come to pass. I appreciate your offer, I am deeply touched. But it's better if we all remain together. I will see my family too, I haven't stopped by for quite a while.~
@47   = ~Please, follow me. I shall point it out to you as we pass its gates. As I said, it has been far too long since last I walked these streets.~
@48   = ~(Bows) I will be glad to offer you my hospitality. Allow me to show the way. It has been far too long since last I walked these streets.~
@49   = ~I'd like to tell you, <CHARNAME>, that I respect you decision to give me some time off.~ [notforme]
@50   = ~Hmm, so you tired yourself so much in my service? You can take a breather any time you wish.~
@51   = ~You allowed me the freedom of choice, if I recall correctly.~
@52   = ~You don't regret this decision?~
@53   = ~Did you enjoy time with your family?~
@54   = ~Tired? No, I would not say so. I meant something else: after spending my time at home, I saw the wisdom of your decision and became convinced that my place is not there, but here, at your side. I sworn a solemn vow and I am not going to break it and leave you.~
@55   = ~However, our journey could be very long, and you might not return home for a long time yet, sir Keldorn.~
@56   = ~This I realise, but once given I am true to my word. <CHARNAME>.~
@57   = ~Sir Keldorn has approved my decision to give him a leave. He is now ready to accompany me to the bitter end, and he is not ruffled by the long parting with his family. I get the feeling that he may have even missed me.~
@58   = ~Yes, and I am glad that I've done that. Yours was a good decision.~
@59   = ~Really? I was afraid that I may be keeping you away from your family.~
@60   = ~But... what of your family? They need you at home.~
@61   = ~Your wife will be upset with you again.~
@62   = ~But I am a Paladin of Torm and my duty is to serve good and righteousness and combat evil. So, onward, <CHARNAME>.~
@63   = ~No.~
@64   = ~Please, take your time to think it over. You can return if you wish.~
@65   = ~More than the fair share, to be honest, <CHARNAME>. I started to get bored.~
@66   = ~(Quietly) <CHARNAME>, what else are you planning to do today? Is not it a good time for us to stop for rest?~
@67   = ~Well, there is still... Sir! Is something wrong?~
@68   = ~(alarmed) What's the matter? Are you feeling ill?~
@69   = ~Did you have a bad night? Nightmares?~
@70   = ~I think that our last meal was quite all right. Perhaps a bit too much. In any case, you should eat less before turning in...~
@71   = ~(Tries to speak quietly, so that his words do not carry on to the rest of the party) I don't feel quite right, can't really explain what's wrong. I feel faint, and have troubles breathing, and there is something... some strange pressure in my chest...~
@72   = ~(Frightened) Yea gods! This isn't something we need just now. Come here, lean on me. Don't worry, I can manage.~
@73   = ~Sir Keldorn, if you'd let me...~
@74   = ~All right, let's call it quits for today. Are you unwell? Should we stop by a temple, or could our healer help you?~
@75   = ~(Decisively) We are going to a temple right that minute, to solve this issue.~
@76   = ~(Quiet) I did not sleep at all. I don't feel quite well, if truth be told...~
@77   = ~After a sleepless night nobody would feel great. We won't be long now, but there are a couple of things we still must do. Verily, sir Keldorn, it won't take us too much time.~
@78   = ~(Sharply) <CHARNAME>! I am quite capable of knowing what it is I should do, and how I should do it. I am sorry for bothering you  my lady.~
@79   = ~<CHARNAME>, I wouldn't want the whole world to know of my troubles. This is not an illness, it's something else. I know enough to realize that my health has nothing to do with it.~
@80   = ~And how did you figure that out? Maybe it's for the best if someone more qualified would take a look at you?~
@81   = ~If you are so sure... What would you have us do now? Go to an inn and stay there till the next morning?~
@82   = ~If this is not a health issue, I don't see why we should go back to an inn.~
@83   = ~(Impatiently) Don't you have any compassion at all? Quite a cold woman you are, my lady.~
@84   = ~Don't even think of it! (Softer) I apologize... I did not mean to snap at you. I know enough myself to realize that my health has nothing to do with this. Forgive me, please.~
@85   = ~That's quite alright. I understand that you don't take me seriously. Lean on my shoulder, sir.~
@86   = ~(Sigh) Whatever you say... you should lie down.~
@87   = ~I only wished to help! Why are you so... Okay, let it be that I know nothing, but you still need to lie down.~
@88   = ~(Leaning on you heavily) I am sorry, my dear... am I not too heavy for you? I don't mean to be making myself such a bother...~
@89   = ~Don't speak nonsense, sir. You should lie down. I will help you undress. Aren't you feeling better even a little bit?~
@90   = ~Here, here... Let me take off your shirt. Lie down. How are you feeling?~
@91   = ~(Embarrassedly) <CHARNAME>...~
@92   = ~Silence, sir, silence! Or, even better tell me how are you feeling? What's bothering you?~
@93   = ~I beg you, leave out this “Sir”. We are comrades at arms, and you can call me by my name. Everyone does just that.~
@94   = ~I don't think it's proper, I don't know what to say. I... I cannot.~
@95   = ~(With a scorn) <CHARNAME>, I did ask.~
@96   = ~All right... Keldorn. How are you feeling?~
@97   = ~It's not a hurt I can name, <CHARNAME>. I am just sick.~
@98   = ~Keldorn, you are scaring me!~
@99   = ~Keldorn! (Sniff)~
@100  = ~(Sobbing quietly)~
@101  = ~(With a faint smile) You mourn me before my time it seems. You see... I think I have overestimated myself. I put on a brave face to show that I can survive the collapse of my life, but it seems that... I cannot.~
@102  = ~You... Do you love her so much?~
@103  = ~We were engaged a long time ago. Did I love her before our wedding? No, we only met once or twice. Only after we were wed, did I see her beauty. She was well brought up, and gentle with me. So as I grew accustomed to her we fell in love.~
@104  = ~I can't even say when it all went wrong. Maybe that happened after the duel... Some hooligan – and a master swordsman, by the way -  he was openly asking for a scandal. I just had to challenge him. He gave me a grave wound, but I prevailed and claimed the victory. Then I was feverish for a long time, and my mother took care of me. I never saw Maria by my sickbed. Perhaps it was then, when something gave way in my heart.~
@105  = ~(Sobbing quietly)... Keldorn...~
@106  = ~(Carefully takes a teardrop off your cheek) But I had hoped that everything could be restored so I took the pain. I am an old-fashioned and sentimental man, who wants to have a family, <CHARNAME>. And I... I just don't understand why she suddenly made a scene.~
@107  = ~Maybe she just wanted a divorce?~
@108  = ~A divorce? Oh, Torm, that thought never visited my mind... (Somberly) So, I should face a lonely years of decline. Where did I go wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
@109  = ~You fell in love with the wrong woman, Keldorn. I.. I don't understand your wife, I can't understand how she could not to love you... (Sob and press your wet cheek against his)... I think you are the best.~
@110  = ~(In a trembling voice) Thank you. You are a sweet girl, <CHARNAME>. Very sweet.~
@111  = ~I've learned something of sir Keldorn's family life. It sounds as though his wife was not faithful to him for a long time, but he tried to preserve his family and did not pay much attention to this. On one hand, I can understand Maria as I would have loved to see him more often at home, and on another... maybe it is her own fault that he was absent so often?~
@112  = ~<CHARNAME>! Have you been sitting here for a long time?~
@113  = ~I was afraid to leave you, you slept poorly.~
@114  = ~You had nightmares.~
@115  = ~You screamed all night long.~
@116  = ~(Placing an emphasis on every word) You were here all night? Guarding me?~
@117  = ~Yeah, what's so special about it? How are you feeling?~
@118  = ~Are you feeling better?~
@119  = ~I've just walked in to check in on you. Why did you think... otherwise?~
@120  = ~I am better, much better. <CHARNAME>... I don't know what to say. Verily, I am touched.~
@121  = ~(Smile) This is because you're sentimental, as you've said so yourself. Lie still, I will bring you some breakfast.~
@122  = ~Why are you trying to deceive me? I can see that you have not been sleeping, here, your eyes are red rimmed.~
@123  = ~I can walk down myself.~
@124  = ~Nay, it's the bed rest for you! You may only get up under the exceptional circumstances.~
@125  = ~Never on your life! Lie down!~
@126  = ~You are spoiling me, oh, my precious healer.~
@127  = ~And why not?~
@128  = ~(In a lecturing tone) This is not a joke, it is a medical procedure!~
@129  = ~You can say so, yes.~
@130  = ~(Laughs) I will enjoy being sick.~
@131  = ~<CHARNAME>, do not feel aggrieved or hold it against me that I keep my silence. I...~
@132  = ~You think you have to entertain me, Keldorn?~
@133  = ~Why, my friend, you definitely have plenty to think over.~
@134  = ~I do not mind.~
@135  = ~And do my talks entertain you, <CHARNAME>?~
@136  = ~No, that is not what I meant! If you don't want to talk, you are welcome to keep your silence.~
@137  = ~(With a grin) That I do... It's just that my speculations lead me to nothing good.~
@138  = ~Do you regret that you have gotten yourself involved with me and my friend?~
@139  = ~What are you trying to tell me, Keldorn?~
@140  = ~I suspect that deep down,  I bore you with all these talks my lady.~
@141  = ~You've got the right suspicion. I need a warrior, not a distressed knight.~
@142  = ~Not a bit.~
@143  = ~You just think I can not help you... you do not trust me.~
@144  = ~(Aggrievedly) You should be ashamed of yourself, <CHARNAME>. I'm in pain, and you...~
@145  = ~...instead of comforting you, only add to your concerns? Please, forgive me.~
@146  = ~Forgive me, my friend, please, forgive me...~
@147  = ~Oh, no matter... I do not know myself what it is I expect to hear.~
@148  = ~You are suffering, Keldorn, it's no wonder... you keep everything to yourself.~
@149  = ~You want me to put my problems onto your delicate shoulders? As if you do not have enough of your own? I set my hand to help you, but I only bring you more troubles...~
@150  = ~You only think I can not help you, you do not trust me.~
@151  = ~You are afraid to trust me, Keldorn!~
@152  = ~(Looking straight into your eyes) You want me to trust you? To allow you to see me as I am? The way, say, my mother knows me? There is nothing of interest there, believe me... I am but an old, miserable paladin who has lost his family... all that was ever precious to him. Why do you need all that, <CHARNAME>? (Bitterly) I am but a loser!~
@153  = ~I told you, Keldorn! I have never met a better person than you, and I... (Stammering)... respect you so much... I will do anything for you!~
@154  = ~You are my closest... friend. I will do anything for you.~
@155  = ~No-no, "everything" is not a necessity. I will not allow you!~
@156  = ~All right, I will ask your permission every time then!~
@157  = ~(With a smile) I need to get your permission to sacrifice myself?~
@158  = ~If I feel up to agreement...~
@159  = ~Keldorn rubs through his solitude painfully. Apparently having a family, presence of people to love, to take care of, meant the world to him despite his restless nature. He is really very sentimental... Nevertheless he is afraid to trust me. Why? Can it be true that my... ancestry is to blame?~
@160  = ~I'm just complaining... I'm all down.~
@161  = ~I know you are hurt, but what can say if you do not share with me?~
@162  = ~Umm... a distressed knight. Is that how my lady sees me? Indeed...~
@163  = ~Keldorn is distressed, he was seeking sympathy and compassion, but I could not give it. Now everything is finished between us... What a shame.~
@164  = ~(Dispassionately) Is that so?...~
@165  = ~Keldorn, if I do not hassle you with questions, that does not mean that I do not care! I just do not think I have a right to worm myself into your confidence.~
@166  = ~You just think I can not help you.... you do not trust me.~
@167  = ~Worming into my confidence? That is not an easy thing to do despite the fact that I feel so... so down.~
@168  = ~But why are keeping everything to yourself, Keldorn? Maybe, you try to talk and set things off your chest?~
@169  = ~I know you are hurt, but what I can  say if you do not share with me?~
@170  = ~I must apologise my lady, I have not been here for such a long time, and the rooms have become rather shabby.~
@171  = ~Shabby? You can't mean that! It's so beautiful here!~
@172  = ~It's not exactly the way I imagined a paladin's castle to be.~
@173  = ~You mean your mother has changed everything here to suit her own taste?~
@174  = ~You like it? It gladdens me to hear you say this. Come my lady, take a seat. I wonder, will the local cuisine be to your taste also?~
@175  = ~What did you expect my lady? That the walls of the rooms here would be plastered with weapons, and not a single picture in sight? I thought you knew me a little better than that. Come, take this seat at the table and try some of our local delicacies.~
@176  = ~(Surprised) Certainly not! She would never dare to change a single thing without my permission. Now, come sit my lady... what say you to the fruit salad?~
@177  = ~<CHARNAME>, I want to talk to you here and now, because I do not know when we will have another chance to do so without fear of interruption or unexpected intrusion.~
@178  = ~I want to know why you put on that ring, why you went to the world of the dead for me, and why you sacrificed yourself on my behalf? I remember your explanations, but if they satisfied me then, they certainly do not now.~
@179  = ~I... I... my own reactions were slow I know but tell me, why did you disturb Kelemvor for the sake of an old battered paladin? My life is behind me, over... my wife has betrayed me, my children are dead. I do not have anything left except  my responsibilities towards you. I cannot leave you, I have no right...~
@180  = ~(Interrupting him) Are you trying to say that I lied to you? You... you... how can you say that? (You burst into tears)~
@181  = ~(Pummelling his breast with your fists) Don't you dare say that, don't you dare! Don't you...~
@182  = ~You are contradicting yourself, Keldorn. On the one hand you are saying that you do not want to live, whilst on the other that you do not have the right to leave me.~
@183  = ~(Shrugging your shoulders) Why should I feel the need to lie to you, Keldorn?~
@184  = ~(Hugs you awkwardly) Calm down, my lady, calm down. Forgive me. I should not have spoken to you thus. I beg your forgiveness.~
@185  = ~(Sobbing) Why do you think that I lied?~
@186  = ~(Whispering) How many times do I have to prove to you how much I care for you?~
@187  = ~No, you should not, but what does it matter if you ceased talking this way? You will still think that your life is ebbing away, that nothing good awaits you, that Maria is the only woman that was worthy of you... and that you'll never be able to love another!~
@188  = ~(Bitterly you push his hands away) Leave me be!~
@189  = ~There is no contradiction in my words. Duty is something that fills one's life with reason!~
@190  = ~What... what about love, Keldorn?~
@191  = ~What... duty! No, I have heard enough about duty! (You turn and make for the door.)~
@192  = ~(Dismayed) I do not know what to say. I thought you were a human being, suffering, hesitating, capable of derring-do for the people dear to your heart, and yet you behave like a statue of law!~
@193  = ~Why did you put on the ring of Cyric, <CHARNAME>?~
@194  = ~Keldorn, you were dying right in front of my eyes! I could not let it happen. I told you once that I will go any length for your sake. Any length, and why... because I love you, because I want us to be together, to fight side by side always!~
@195  = ~(You speak softly but slowly you hear your voice begins to get louder) I had no choice, Keldorn... no one would come to my aid, none of the Gods! I called out to everyone of them in turn, they do not care about you nor about me, none of them do. EVEN YOUR TORM TURNED AWAY!~
@196  = ~(Irritably) I do not understand... why the interrogation? Bah, forget it and leave me be!~
@197  = ~(As if an echo) Care... my lady... you care for me?~
@198  = ~(Softly) I love you.~
@199  = ~That surprises you? It never crossed your mind that I might... fall in love with you? (Tenderly) My beloved paladin.~
@200  = ~(Shaking his head) I simply do not see a future for me, <CHARNAME>.  My life... it is almost finished.~
@201  = ~No, I won't allow you to bury yourself alive! I love you and like it or not, that is something you are just going to have to accept!~
@202  = ~Then I do not know why we are having this conversation!~
@203  = ~(He pales) <CHARNAME>, I beg you... tell me, why then did you risk your life for me?~
@204  = ~For nothing, or so it would seem. Nothing! (You head towards the door)~
@205  = ~(Softly) I don't have the strength to argue with you any more. Remain with your delusions if that is your wish Keldorn.~
@206  = ~Love... Love is a duty also, but it is a duty that needs to be mutual my lady. If I knew... if I felt that someone loved me, truly loved me, would I have spent my nights and days in the Order's headquarters? I loved Maria, I told you, but my love gradually faded, and with the death of our darling girls, it died completely.~
@207  = ~(You begin to sob) What about me Keldorn? What about me? I love you.~
@208  = ~I... I see. This is all so pointlesss!~
@209  = ~(Runs after you and grabs your hand) No please, my lady... don't go! I was being egotistical, please forgive me. You have always treated me with such tenderness and care, and here I am interrogating you like a common criminal. Forgive me, please?~
@210  = ~(Looking into his eyes) I love you!~
@211  = ~You say this now, but tomorrow will be just the same. No, I am tired of your suspicions. ~
@212  = ~(Hotly) Like a statue... I am a statue?! Bah, what do you understand, girl? (Opening the door) Go away!~
@213  = ~But... (You turn to leave the room)~
@214  = ~I... I did not mean to offend you.~
@215  = ~Why do you take such offence?! Is anger the only emotion you are capable of? I do not wish to know you any more. Farewell my angry paladin!~
@216  = ~What... what did you say? No, it can't be true, you just believe it to be so. You treat me well, but love... No, it's impossible. No matter how much I may hope... No, things just do not happen this way.~
@217  = ~Nevertheless, it is true. I love you. Kelemvor made me look inside my heart and realise it was so. If you do not trust me, then believe Kelemvor. To him the souls of the living are like an open book. I love you, Keldorn, I do.~
@218  = ~(Sadly) Again you do not believe me. Again you insult me with your suspicions. Why Keldorn, why?!~
@219  = ~Then don't believe me! I love you anyway and I do not care whether you accept it or not!~
@220  = ~Neither Torm nor Tyr nor any other could have helped you and you know that well enough, but I will not allow you to berate my god in my presence, nor any other god for that matter. I have no more questions for you my lady. We may depart the castle today and go rescue your Imoen.~
@221  = ~(The pain of recent events shows in his voice as he speaks) I am an old man, <CHARNAME>. Please understand how difficult this is for me! I can not decide to simply erase my previous life, my experiences in a single stroke.~
@222  = ~I had hoped you would help me to forget, to start a new beginning. I am sorry, I see know how I must have worn you down with my mourning. Forgive me my lady, I should not have started this conversation, forgive me. (He turns away from you)~
@223  = ~(You walk over and put your arms around him) Keldorn, I was saying all the wrong things. I should have just simply said, I love you.~
@224  = ~Yes. I see how the spirits of your wife and children hold you tight and until you lay them to rest, there is no way for you to start anew!~
@225  = ~<CHARNAME>, my lady! Forgive me. I lost my temper, I am sorry.~
@226  = ~(Looking deeply into his eyes) I love you.~
@227  = ~Please, forgive me also.~
@228  = ~I do not know why I started this conversation, <CHARNAME>.~
@229  = ~I do. You wanted to hear "I love you", and I will tell you, I love you, Keldorn!~
@230  = ~(Smiling) You are just grumpy and in a bad mood. I love you Keldorn, bad mood and all.~
@231  = ~My lady, I... I... (He looks at you as if trying to find the right words but then he waves his hand in despair and turns away.) I have no more questions for you my lady. We may depart the castle today and go rescue your Imoen.~
@232  = ~(Seeming perplexed and embarassed) I... I am not ready to answer you, <CHARNAME>, I did not expect such a show of affection, although... (His voice drops to a whisper) I was desperate to hear it. I...~
@233  = ~(You close his mouth with a kiss, he pulls you close and holds your trembling body firmly against his own. His kiss, rough at first, quickly yields to the softness of your own mouth and you are lost in each other for what seems like an eternity.)~
@234  = ~(Suddenly he groans and pulls away, sliding to the floor, he kneels, hiding his face in your breast. After a moment, he raises his head and, with a strange look in his eyes, whispers to you: 'Don't leave me')~
@235  = ~(These three words turn your soul about, and it suddenly strikes you that you are seeing a new Keldorn... you are not sure how to respond.)~
@236  = ~('Love is a great responsibility, my dear girl', Gorion's words leap to your mind. Then you see something flash in Keldorn's eyes, he stands up and gently taking you in his arms, he holds you tightly to him once again. His is a strong and yet at the same time, tender embrace.)~
@237  = ~(He looks into your eyes again and you forget everything, Imoen, Irenicus, your taint... everything, they are forgotten. There are only his eyes, blocking out everything else.)~
@238  = ~(Covering his face with his hands) I do not know... Forgive me. I am just too afraid to believe that happiness...~
@239  = ~(Raising his voice) Yea gods, <CHARNAME>, I can not forget them, I do not want to forget them! (Lowers his voice) This is my life, this is I, Keldorn Firecam.~
@240  = ~So, I need either to take you as you are or part with you?~
@241  = ~(Startled) For you... you say, for you? You... you say that you love me? Tell me that my ears are not deceiving me my lady?~
@242  = ~Yes and yes and YES again! There is nothing wrong with your ears, you oaf. I love you.~
@243  = ~(Angrily) Enough! I have heard all I need to hear! We may depart the castle today and go rescue your Imoen.~
@244  = ~(Shrugs his shoulders) I am as you see me my lady.~
@245  = ~I love you, Keldorn. It is not my intention to replace Maria or your girls, they will always be in your memory, but surely there is enough room in your heart for them and for me.~
@246  = ~I understand. The past holds you too tightly, and you yourself do not want to be rid of it. It is almost as though you are enjoying savouring your own sufferings.~
@247  = ~(Seeing that you are not tired, even though it is well into the night already) What's up, <CHARNAME>? Why are you so restless?~
@248  = ~I am scared. I can't sleep.~
@249  = ~I'm afraid to fall asleep, Keldorn.~
@250  = ~Me too. I keep trying to think of ways to exorcise the demon from your soul.~
@251  = ~I do not have a soul!~
@252  = ~Nonsense! He's taken only a part of your soul, the part that is connected with the Bhaalspawn but the main part of your human soul is still with you, if it wasn't then you'd be dead already. And now the Slayer has found his home there. Are you afraid of him, afraid that he will possess you whilst you are asleep?~
@253  = ~Yes.~
@254  = ~I feel him. I know he sits there, waiting for me to fall asleep!~
@255  = ~But this is not the way, <CHARNAME>. You can't go on denying sleep forever. Come now, things can not be that bad. You sleep and I will watch over you.~
@256  = ~No, no! It's too dangerous! I may kill you!~
@257  = ~And what if I kill you as I killed all our companions in Esmeltaran?~
@258  = ~I am not that helpless, I think you are worrying over nothing.~
@259  = ~(Sighing) Maybe. All right, I'll try to sleep but you must try to sleep yourself, you also need some rest.~
@260  = ~I wish I had your confidence paladin. All right, I'll take your advice but you must try to sleep yourself, you also need some rest.~
@261  = ~Are you... certain? (Hugs you) Hey, what's this, you are shivering, this won't do. I'll stay with you. Come, take off your clothes and lie down, there is nothing for you to fear.~
@262  = ~And you, you are not going to stay awake all night, are you! (Shyly) Come, lie down here next to me, there's room enough.~
@263  = ~I'm afraid, it's too dangerous!~
@264  = ~There is no need for embarrassment, you sat by me, remember and now it is my turn. Take off your clothes, I'll look away if it makes you feel better. Now sleep, there is nothing for you to fear.~
@265  = ~You see, everything is all right. You worried for nothing. (Bends and kisses your forehead) I've been looking at you and thinking, you are so unlike my wife. I tried to find at least one common feature and could not. You and Maria – you are both beautiful, but your beauty is of a different nature.~
@266  = ~(Takes your hands and examines them, then he continues with a smile) Well, Maria definitely had no calluses and scars.~
@267  = ~(You snatch your hands away) My hands are good only for killing. Nobody would think to raise them to his lips.~
@268  = ~Why are you saying all this Keldorn?~
@269  = ~(Bursts out laughing and taking your hands in his, he proceeds to kiss every callus and graze... then he catches you up in his arms and with a sudden jerk lifts you from the bed.) Get up, enough lounging.~
@270  = ~(You find yourself blushing to the roots of your hair) Keldorn! I am not fit to be seen.~
@271  = ~(Opening your eyes wide) Keldorn! What if I had been naked under here?~
@272  = ~So what... you were not naked. And even if you were, would it be so terrible? Now, get dressed. (He turns away, allowing you the privacy to get dressed.)~
@273  = ~(Smiling) I do not know... no particular reason. Now get dressed, it's time to get up.~
@274  = ~<CHARNAME>, tell me please, why do you never ask questions of me? Does my company bore you am I of no interest to you?~
@275  = ~Keldorn! How could you think such a thing! I have told you that I love you, how can you be of no interest to me?~
@276  = ~(You look reprovingly at him) You are imagining things my friend. I just don't want to appear too nosy.~
@277  = ~Well... everyone has a right to keep secrets. I may inadvertently ask about things that you'd prefer to keep to yourself and then you'd feel uncomfortable refuse to answer. We don't need such complications and anyway, you tell me enough to satisfy my curiosity.~
@278  = ~You still haven't answered my question <CHARNAME>.~
@279  = ~(Shrugging) I really don't know what to say.~
@280  = ~(With a grin) Now that has to be a first an incurious woman!~
@281  = ~You do not see me as a woman at all!~
@282  = ~Have you forgotten that I was brought up by monks?~
@283  = ~(Shaking his head) You do surprise me. I have to give credit to your foster father, he brought you up well. Let us leave it here and please forgive my starting this conversation. Come, we have things to do.~
@284  = ~(He becomes ornery) And I do not know why I insist. I'm sorry... come, we have things to do.~
@285  = ~(Looking puzzled) <CHARNAME>... forgive me if I have given you cause to believe that is so. Despite my age I find I can still appreciate a beautiful woman.~
@286  = ~(Blushing) Keldorn, that's not at all what I meant!~
@287  = ~(Curtly) Let's leave this subject Keldorn... it will lead to no good.~
@288  = ~I did. I'm sorry I should not have started this conversation. Come, we have things to do.~
@289  = ~What else is meant when a man is accused of showing a lack of interest towards a female? Though I doubt you even consider me a man. No matter, we should forget it as no doubt I asked for it. Come, we have spent too much time here already.~
@290  = ~(Sighing) What else do I have left?~
@291  = ~(You can't sleep. You keep thinking about the last conversation you had with Keldorn, he would never have behaved like that before. You remember Kelemvor's warning, but appealing to a powerful god simply because your beloved acts strangely doesn't seem to be a wise move. You turn towards Keldorn's bed and find it empty. He is sitting by the fire watching the dancing flame. On hearing your steps, Keldorn raises his eyes.)~
@292  = ~You probably want to hear some explanation from me, but I have nothing to say. I know I am acting like a petulant child, but I do not understand why. It seems to me that Kelemvor and you played a mean joke on me even if unintentionally. I am... changing, do you understand? I am not the Keldorn Firecam, senior officer of the Order that you found in Athkatla's sewers.~
@293  = ~(He sneers, then suddenly bends to you almost touching your face with his lips) Your blood, <CHARNAME>, your hot young blood! I... I must appear mad to you but it is this divine blood of yours, it forces me to act unwisely. I want to be with you, I want to... to hold you, I want (he turns away and covers his face with his hands)... and I can't help it, <CHARNAME>, I just can't.~
@294  = ~(You put your arms around him not sure what to say)~
@295  = ~(Feeling a little afraid, you take a step back) K-Kel-dorn...~
@296  = ~(Sighing heavily you look into his eyes) Keldorn, if it is my consent that you seek to solve your dilemma... then I willingly come to you my love.~
@297  = ~(Quietly) Thank you. I'm better now. I received but a small drop of your blood and I can not cope with it. How do you manage to control it? In my ignorance, I did not fully realize what it means to be a semi-god... until now.~
@298  = ~I've become accustomed to it my love. When I was small, it did not manifest itself strongly, it started developing gradually as I moved into adulthood. Even now I am still lacking in knowledge you know... and though I'm used to struggling with myself, now I find I must battle with the slayer.~
@299  = ~(Laughing softly) You will learn. (Suddenly, the same words echo in your mind. *YOU WILL LEARN* but they seem to be from some distant time past and soon they have slipped from your mind.)~
@300  = ~It will take time but you will learn to control it. That I have no doubt.~
@301  = ~(Jerking his head back) Do I scare you? Yea gods, Torm.~
@302  = ~(You notice the pain in his eyes) No, my love, there... no. (You put your arms around him and hold him gently to you.)~
@303  = ~(Sighing heavily you look into his eyes) Keldorn, if it is my consent that you seek to solve your dilemma, then I willingly come to you my love.~
@304  = ~(His eyes brighten as he looks at you in admiration. On his face you clearly see the signs of some inner conflict that he is battling within himself. Suddenly his features relax and you feel that what ever the turmoil was, he has won through this time.)~
@305  = ~Thank you for understanding my dear, you have no idea how important that is for me but how could I ever respect myself if I were to take advantage of the moment of you! I... I will overcome this failing myself.~
@306  = ~I would be right in saying that you are a virgin are you not?~
@307  = ~(Seeing your face turn scarlet, he takes your hand and presses it to his face) No... no my sweet girl, there is no need for you to be embarrassed. Virginity is but a state of being and yet, by offering yourself to me in this way, it would be the greatest gift you could bestow upon me.~
@308  = ~I can not take your gift, not yet. It is far too precious a thing to give away hastily, and as much as I am tempted by your beauty, by your naivness, I respect you too much my dear to lose myself in the heat of the moment.~
@309  = ~However, I will accept your kiss my dearest <CHARNAME>.~
@310  = ~(As his lips touch yours, his kiss becomes demanding and yet still gentle. You feel your heart leap in your breast and you suddenly become giddy, light headed... as if you have just been lifted up high. The kiss ends and as Keldorn reluctantly pulls away he smiles.)~
@311  = ~So you have never recieved a man's kiss before. I can see that we will have to make up for lost time.~
@312  = ~(He becomes despondent) Slayer. I wish I was more certain that I could protect you from him. Every time you turn into him he will take you further and further from the Light. I ask you... no I implore you, please my darling girl, do not surrender to him! He will try to seduce you, whispering his words of power.~
@313  = ~I promise. I'll not fall for his dark speeches.~
@314  = ~(A glint comes to your eye) I'd prefer that it were you trying to seduce me.~
@315  = ~I think you are making something of nothing.~
@316  = ~Learn? Yes, you are right of course but you will help me, won't you? In return I will teach you of other things.~
@317  = ~(Suspiciously) Teach me of other things. What other things do you have in mind?~
@318  = ~What, yet more learning. Did I not suffer enough in Candlekeep?~
@319  = ~(Sadly) You do not want to help me?~
@320  = ~I do and if it is my consent that you seek. Then I willingly come to you my love.~
@321  = ~Tell me what it is you wish of me my love, tell me for I'll do anything?~
@322  = ~(Looking deeply into your eyes) I have your word? Then I shall pray for Torm to bring you strength to aid you in your resolve. Promise?~
@323  = ~(Sighing) I am serious <CHARNAME>! You are going to find it difficult to withstand his might, believe me you are! Until we return that which Irenicus has stolen, he isn't going to give you a moments peace.~
@324  = ~Believe me, I am not! He will become stronger, more powerful and until we return that which Irenicus has stolen, he isn't going to give you a moments peace.~
@325  = ~(The corners of his eyes crinkle as he smiles) Mmm... maybe how to kiss a man properly? Your kiss is delicious my sweet girl, it leaves a taste of honey on a man's lips and yet I get the feeling there is still a sweetness awaiting to be woken by the bee.~
@326  = ~(Ignoring your protests he pulls you to him, smothering your mouth with his own, then laughing he pulls back) Now it is your turn.~
@327  = ~(Bursts out laughing, then pulling you to him) I doubt monks taught you how to kiss a man properly my sweet! Come here and learn.~
@328  = ~(Sighing, then pulling you gently to him) I wish I knew my dear, I wish I knew. Please, a kiss at least.~
@329  = ~(You sit a while longer and eventually you fall asleep. As your head touches the pillow, your eyes close and you do not hear Keldorn wishing you sweet dreams. In front of you a strange face appears, strange and yet you sense that it is a face known to you.)~
@330  = ~(His face stern and yet serene.) You had a nightmare again, only this time you were speaking quite clearly and I heard everything. So Torm... (he smiles). Anyway now I know how to help you, <CHARNAME> and I will do it. At all costs.~
@331  = ~It started so well but it finished so sadly! Keldorn was so nice when he was speaking about... how did he put it his problems. Really he considers me too naive and childlike. Maybe it's for the best, who knows? However, his last statement frightened me. What does he have in mind? He definitely arrived at some uneasy decision saying that he will help me. I am certain that he is doing so against his will. Suddenly I am frightened.~
@332  = ~(Jocularly) <CHARNAME>, how do you find me? Does my new face become me?~
@333  = ~Oh, Keldorn. I can't wait until I see your real face again. I can't talk to you seriously while you look like a drow. I know it's stupid but I just can't. I'm sorry.~
@334  = ~How can you make jokes now? We are among enemies who may become suspicious at any moment and discover our real identities. I don't understand your carelessness.~
@335  = ~(Casting him a quick glance) No, I do not like it.~
@336  = ~(Softly) I understand my sweet. I have something to talk to you about as well, but I want to see your face, your eyes, your smile. All right my dear, let us leave all talks for later.~
@337  = ~(Apologetically) I am sorry. I wanted to cheer you up but I'm afraid I've done that rather awkwardly. I'm sorry my dear, we'll talk later.~
@338  = ~(Sighing) Looks like you are not in the mood to talk, <CHARNAME>.~
@339  = ~<CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>... what ever is it? You are shaking all over... (putting his arms around you). Please calm yourself... we are at war and elves have never been known to trust strangers at the best of times.~
@340  = ~It's just... this damned interrogation Keldorn, it is absolutely revolting!~
@341  = ~They dare interrogate me in this appalling manner. Me... an elf! This is... this is... words fail me, I am speechless!~
@342  = ~Are they blind? Any fool can see I have elven blood in my ancestry... not drow!~
@343  = ~They are not humans my dear. Do you think the Order does not admit non-humans without a good reason? They have a different vision of the world, different ethics, different philosophies, different values and their understanding of "honour" is also different to the way we humans perceive it.~
@344  = ~Come, let it trouble you no more, it's high time we returned home... after all, time and tide wait for no man.~
@345  = ~I agree with you, I was outraged myself. It's strange that Adalon did not speak up for us. Come, let it trouble you no more, it's high time we returned home... after all, time and tide wait for no man.~
@346  = ~Don't forget that you have humans as well as elves among your ancestors. Elves do not trust us, it's a fact, they are a closed race and trust no one. It may be so because they live too long, who knows but come, let it trouble you no more, it's high time we returned home... after all, time and tide wait for no man.~
@347  = ~(Determindely) You do as you wish <CHARNAME>, but I am not able to go any further until I wash off the dirt of those dungeons. Look at that lovely lake over there. Why don't we encamp here and have some rest... we deserve it.~
@348  = ~Were not the baths in Ust-Natha warm enough and clean enough for you? Didn't you enjoy the delicate silk bedsheets and the soft pillows of the inn there? In comparison the most luxurious inn in Athkatla will look a rat infested stable!~
@349  = ~To be honest I would enjoy a bathe myself.~
@350  = ~You say it as if you think I'd mind!~
@351  = ~(Laughing.) Don't find faults with my words my darling. Come, get those grimey clothes off and let's have a swim.~
@352  = ~(You feel the colour creep into your cheeks) Undressed... you mean completely... but what about...~
@353  = ~Um... maybe we should probably wait until it gets dark?~
@354  = ~(Looking around fervently) But Keldorn, there are no bushes here!~
@355  = ~Then what are you waiting for... get those grimey clothes off and let's have a swim.~
@356  = ~(Artfully) No offense meant, it's just in case. Now get those grimey clothes off and let's have a swim, the water looks warm.~
@357  = ~(Laughing heartedly) <CHARNAME>... you sleep in underwear, so why so shy of going into the water with it on? Though if my lady would prefer to swim naked, I wouldn't mind.~
@358  = ~(Your face becomes bright red with anger) You... you... you!~
@359  = ~(He scoops up a handful of water and splashes it into your face) Cool down my dear! Forgive me that was an insensitive joke on my part. How may I wash away my guilt?~
@360  = ~(He drops down on bended knee and extends his hand to you) I offer you my hand and my heart, <CHARNAME>, you are free to do with them whatever you wish!~
@361  = ~(You step back angrily) Your clowning passes all bounds, lord Keldorn!~
@362  = ~(You speak softly as tears well up in your eyes) That was a bad joke, Keldorn!~
@363  = ~(Your eyes pop wide open and you open and close your mouth several times but no words will come.)~
@364  = ~(He becomes surly) Clowning... you say I am a clown? I wouldn't joke about such things. Is it so hard for you to believe that I am serious. Certainly my proposal may seem strange and sudden, but I am ready to repeat it. However, I'll not demand an answer from you right away, though I must say your mistrust goes to my heart.~
@365  = ~(He sighs heavily) I asked that we should swim did I not? Then let us brave the water, it will refresh both your body and your thoughts.~
@366  = ~(The cool, clear water of the lake calms you down, helping you to gather your thoughts. He was joking of course. Count Firecam would not seriously marry a humble girl of unknown parentage. It was another of his jokes because he does not take seriously either you or your love. Unwilling tears to well up in your eyes... determined not to let Keldorn see them, you dive and swim under water.)~
@367  = ~(You reach the opposite shore. Keldorn suggests that you rest and you stretch with pleasure on the white sand, warming yourself under the hot rays. You do not notice that your wet underwear is clinging to your body.)~
@368  = ~(Keldorn softly kisses you on your lips) You have warmed yourself... and you are once again calm, yes? Good, then I will repeat what I said a few moments ago. It's true, I want you to be my wife but I did not expect you to be so astonished at my proposal. You confessed your love to me, why were you so surprised by my response?~
@369  = ~Or maybe you (his voice becomes despondent)... maybe you only said that you loved me in the heat of the moment and now you are regretting it? Am I repugnant to you? Tell me and if it is so then I will disappear from your life forever.~
@370  = ~(You leap up and embrace him) I love you and I want to be with you so much. Your proposal just caught me off guard. I still can't believe you really mean it.~
@371  = ~(Your eyes open wide in amazement) You, count Firecam, want to marry me, a girl of unknown parentage? You are not joking?~
@372  = ~I... I do not trust you.~
@373  = ~(Quietly) This is no joke, <CHARNAME>. Did I frighten you? I can see I acted too impulsively, let us put off this conversation aside for some other time and take our swim... come, the water looks inviting.~
@374  = ~(Bursts out laughing, takes you by your hand and pulls you into the water.) You were not expecting that were you? See, it is still within my power to surprise you.~
@375  = ~(Kissing you firmly) My beautiful girl... I have never been more serious in my life. (He cups your breast in his hand and kissing it he whispers) I want to live with you, I want to take care of you. I want to love you.~
@376  = ~(You remove a long chain with a ring hanging on it from your neck and put it on Keldorn's finger) This is Gorion's ring. Imoen kept it for a very long time until Irenicus took it from her. Later, she managed to steal it from him and gave it to me. Gorion told me that the ring is imbued with magical power but he knew not what that power is. Whatever it is, it could not save my father.~
@377  = ~(Winks at you.) What jokes can there be at such a moment? I really do. Though you are not a simple girl either, you are a semi-god and as such, people will be envious that I am the one who won your heart.~
@378  = ~You don't trust me? Tell me. what does it take for you to believe in me? Do you wish that I should kneel before you or that I should perform a heroic deed in your honour?~
@379  = ~Nothing, Keldorn... yes, I told you that I love you and it is true but I cannot marry you. I have no wish to endanger you. I am cursed, I bring misfortune to people I care about. I do not want to bring you to your death. This is my final word. I'm sorry my love. I beg of you, do not try to persuade me.~
@380  = ~(Pressing his lips to the ring) It still carries the warmth of your body. You have given me the most precious thing that you have, what better declaration of love could a man wish for?~
@381  = ~In Athkatla we will send a letter to my mother. We'll tell her to make preparations for our wedding. I'll tell you a secret, when we left Esmeltaran, she warned me that she would turn me from the door if I were to let you slip through my fingers.~
@382  = ~(Tears well up in his eyes) You... then why did you bring me from Kelemvor's kingdom? Why? (Seizes you by your shoulders and shakes you) Tell me... why?! I love you, <CHARNAME>. Please let me be with you, I beg you.~
@383  = ~(Closing your eyes you shake your head) No, Keldorn. Forgive me.~
@384  = ~(His voice becomes flat) You are mistaken, my love. Will you not leave me even a little hope? I can't bear this... (Pressing his hand to his chest) I won't.~
@385  = ~Darling, what are you going to do now?~
@386  = ~I am going to try on a dress so that Frida may complete her work.~
@387  = ~Oh, of course the dress. It is very important, that I understand. Would you mind if I have a look? I am interested in everything that concerns you and our forthcoming wedding. Besides I am very curious as to what sort of taste this Frida has.~
@388  = ~(Eyeing the dress) Lovely indeed... Nothing to quibble about here but tell me Frida, why have you made the dress with so high a neckline?~
@389  = ~(Furrowing his brow) Why so? Maria used to always wear dresses with low necklines...it is the fashion, is it not?~
@390  = ~(Laughing) And if the face is beautiful, eh, Frida? What if there are no flaws?~
@391  = ~(Sitting you on his lap) How are things with you my love? Are you getting used to feeling that you are mistress of this place... and my wife? My mother says that Frida has spent many days and nights preparing your marriage trousseau.~
@392  = ~(Quickly releasing yourself from his warm embrace) You see what our haste has done?~
@393  = ~You should really increase her salary, don't you think?~
@394  = ~(Blushing) Wife? But...~
@395  = ~(Sighing) There, there, my dearest girl... (Enfolding you in his arms) Will you show me Frida's work?~
@396  = ~Keldorn! That is hardly decent.~
@397  = ~(Kissing him) Can't you wait just a day longer?~
@398  = ~(Embarrassed but firmly) No-no, swimming was quite enough for me!~
@399  = ~(Laughing) You increase it then. You are free to give any orders you want here my love.~
@400  = ~(Slyly) Any... truly? Does that include to you as well?~
@401  = ~Aren't you afraid for your fortune? I am a girl of no family after all.~
@402  = ~(Nestling your face into his shoulder) I don't want to take charge. I am so tired.~
@403  = ~(Burying your head on his chest) All right, take me, my love... Why do we need to wait until tomorrow?~
@404  = ~(Quietly) Yes. You know it to be true so why wait until tomorrow, let us try our own bed tonight?~
@405  = ~(Firmly) No, my love. I feel uneasy. Because of your mother... your servants.~
@406  = ~But our wedding is tomorrow! Does one day really matter so much my love. You know in my heart that I have considered you as my wife for a long time now?~
@407  = ~I do understand, my darling, but... let's wait until tomorrow.~
@408  = ~(Burying your head on his chest) All right, take me, my love. Why do we need to wait until tomorrow?~
@409  = ~(A little abashed) Yes of course I understand but this room has not been made ready for you! Come my dearest, let me sleep here whilst you sleep in my room.~
@410  = ~Why is there something wrong with this room?~
@411  = ~To me? Why, don't you know that you already command me my love? Now how about you order me to carry you to our bed?~
@412  = ~(Moving away from him) No! I can't. What will your mother think of me?~
@413  = ~(Smiling) I am not afraid. I trust you, girl of no family. Come, I'll show you to our room and our bed. It's time to try it.~
@414  = ~I will have a look at the room, but trying the bed... sorry, my love, I can't. Please believe me, I just can't!~
@415  = ~Then I will carry you to our bed.~
@416  = ~No! Please, I beg of you Keldorn... don't force me.~
@417  = ~No, it's fine. Everything is fine. Sweet dreams, my love. (He kisses you and leaves.)~
@418  = ~(Carrying you into his room and... suddenly Slayer appears.)~
@419  = ~(You can't sleep. You are tossing and turning, trying to get comfortable, when suddenly a vision appears before your eyes.)~
@420  = ~(You see an old hag pointing her finger at you, her voice croaking: "A curse on you! You will never be happy with him, you will never know peace!")~
@421  = ~(Then, for a moment she has Maria Firecam's face, as you gasp she is once again the old hag. You open your eyes, not sure whether it was a dream or real.)~
@422  = ~(It is very dark in the room and suddenly you are afraid. Fear surrounds you and begins burrowing deep into your heart. You begin to shiver, you feel dizzy and sick.)~
@423  = ~(All you know is that you don't want to be alone in this room and then you remember Keldorn's offer to exchange rooms. He must have known something, but did not say anything, why you wonder?)~
@424  = ~(Carefully you get up from the bed, too afraid to light a candle you feel around in the dark for your grown and slippers.)~
@425  = ~(Silently you slip out to the corridor and head for Keldorn's room. To your relief you find his door is half-open and a light burns within.)~
@426  = ~(Putting away a book) You've come. Why, whatever is the matter my dear?~
@427  = ~I... I do not know. I am scared, I am dreadfully scared. There is something there... in the room...~
@428  = ~(Drawing you into his arms) There-there... calm down. You are safe here. (Reprovingly) You see, you should have slept here. Tell your Keldorn what it is that has frightened you so, another nightmare?~
@429  = ~I do not know... I feel strange. I tell you, there's something in that room!~
@430  = ~I will take a look.  Here, you sit on the bed and wait for me.~
@431  = ~No! I am coming with you!~
@432  = ~I'm afraid to be alone. Please take me with you, I must be sure myself.~
@433  = ~(Taking a candle) Let us go then... one moment, where is your amulet? Why have you taken it off?~
@434  = ~I took it off when I was bathing and then... just forgot to put it back on.~
@435  = ~I... I thought that I would not need it here. You must take Carsomyr!~
@436  = ~(You go along the corridor, Keldorn pushes the door of your room open and enters, holding the candle in his outstretched hand you see there's no one inside.)~
@437  = ~(Suddenly he is silent. His features tighten and drops of sweat appear on his forehead. With a warning gesture he grabs Carsomyr and peers into the void.)~
@438  = ~(Whispering, Keldorn tells you to take your amulet, but you can't move. You try to call out his name but only a harsh croak leaves your mouth.)~
@439  = ~(Your fiance is no longer looking at you, he is slashing about furiously as if fighting some invisible foe. His blue robe is dark, drenched with sweat as Carsomyr, time and time again, wings hissing through the air.)~
@440  = ~(You see that Keldorn is tiring and know that he can not last much longer. You make a final effort and stretch your hand for the driad's necklace but at the very same moment you hear a terrible howling in your ears causing your body to shudder violently.)~
@441  = ~(You feel as if a tightly coiled spring has unwound itself inside you, exploding through your mind. Your body is shaking uncontrollably, your whole being is straining, you are growing taller.)~
@442  = ~(Your head is thrown back and the muscles in your neck harden as though they are turning to stone... a terrifying shriek builds from the pit of your stomach and traveling up, bursts from your throat.)~
@443  = ~(Keldorn turns quickly, the horror you see in his eyes stings your heart as surely as if a dagger had pierced it but it is too late, you can not stop yourself now... when you become a Slayer)~
@444  = ~(You body is filled with strength and power, your sight is clear, and you see abominable shadows, Irenicus's demons... so these are what Keldorn has been fighting.)~
@445  = ~(You begin slaughtering them and with each one that goes down exhilaration and immense pleasure fills your mind as you relish in the bloodbath. However, your satisfaction is not complete... something is preventing it, a niggling in the back of you mind.)~
@446  = ~(You concentrate, straining to find the source of the aggravation and suddenly you realize that it is Keldorn shouting at you...) Back! Get back! You are dying!~
@447  = ~(The truth of his words suddenly fill your mind and you struggle to hang on to the remnants of your consciousness. All power leaves you and darkness rolls over you as you return to your human form.)~
@448  = ~(Consciousness is slowly and unwillingly returning to you, and with it comes pain. You feel revulsion as everything comes back to you. You clearly remember everything - your transformation and worst of all, the fear in the eyes of your beloved.)~
@449  = ~(Keldorn was afraid of you, a monster breaking  free despite your will. This is the end... the end of your happiness and of your dreams. There is nothing to be done, a wedding is out of the question.)~
@450  = ~(It is all your own fault, only you are to blame because once again you did not heed advice and through your stubbornness, you exposed your beloved to danger.)~
@451  = ~(You open your eyes and find yourself lying in Keldorn's bed. He is kneeling beside you, with his head resting on the edge. Your hand touches your fiance's and his head jerks up suddenly...)~
@452  = ~You have recovered! I was so afraid that you would never again regain consciousness. My darling, I almost ruined you, forgive me please, I beg you!~
@453  = ~You? Why, what has this to do with you? This is all my fault, I did not listen to you!~
@454  = ~(Quietly) This is a sign, Keldorn. We can't be together.~
@455  = ~He's won, he's stronger.~
@456  = ~No! This has come about through my folly, my mistrust. My brave girl, does she get scared?~
@457  = ~(Quietly) My virtuous bride, can she not come to me at night without a reason? I thought I could protect you by marrying you and... (his voice drops to almost a whisper.) by taking your virginity.~
@458  = ~I misinterpret your dream – remember? – and almost lost you forever. The first thing we must do is kill that damned mage and return that which he tore from you!~
@459  = ~Forgive me, I'm so sorry. I should not have rushed you into a wedding, I can see that you are not yet ready.~
@460  = ~Rushed... rushed?! Maybe it is you who has changed your mind now that you realize your bride is a monster?!~
@461  = ~I... I did not keep my word, I promised not to turn into the slayer, so I free you from your promise my love. I stupidly thought that I could control my essence but I was mistaken. I can promise you nothing, nothing at all.~
@462  = ~What sign, what are you talking about?~
@463  = ~Don't you understand? Your ex-wife... I saw her. She condemned me! She is right, sweetheart... we can't build our happiness on another's misfortune. Your girls, your daughters will always stand between us! Were they alive, they would never accept me.~
@464  = ~Never... don't even think that! He can't win, he's evil. We have light on our side, my love, and light is stronger than any evil.~
@465  = ~Remember, since I have decided to join my life with the life of a daughter of Bhaal, I will do everything possible and impossible to save you, even from yourself. I love you and I will always love you no matter what.~
@466  = ~Now hush, no more arguing with me, I am a redeemer after all. Let us get some sleep my love.~
@467  = ~But I love you! Whatever happens know this: I do love you. And I am not going to give you up, not to any slayer nor to Kelemvor. Let him seek another ally.~
@468  = ~Look... (Keldorn carefully turns your head) See the symbol over there? My father put it there a long time ago, when I was just a boy. Demons are afraid of it and they will never enter the room.~
@469  = ~That amulet that queen Vaelasa gave you possesses the same kind of power. That is why I asked you to never take it off, at least, not until we best Irenicus.~
@470  = ~But... how do you know?~
@471  = ~Irenicus? How come he knows I am still alive?~
@472  = ~(Softly) Did you forget that you are marrying a redeemer? I have some experience in this kind of thing you know but hush now, you need to sleep my love. Here, let me tuck you in. Sleep my darling.~
@473  = ~You killed Bodhi, his sister, that wouldn't have escaped his notice but hush now, you need to sleep my love. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. Sleep my darling.~
@474  = ~(With a sigh) As a step-mother... no, but... is this the reason? I saw how you grieved over Gorion, but how could I fail to understand that?~
@475  = ~You wept over Ajantis – did I have a right to be jealous? Gorion, Ajantis, Khalid... they will be with you forever and I do not want you to forget them. The same with me my dear <CHARNAME>.~
@476  = ~I also do not want to forget either Maria or my girls. They will always remain with me, in my memory but it does not mean they will take your place. Even if I forget them, I could not possibly love you more.~
@477  = ~I can't live without you... (sighs) but hush now, it is time for you to sleep my love. We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow so no more bad thoughts and remember, whatever happens I love you.~
@478  = ~Thank you, Kachiko. By Torm, I wish I could retire from this life of battle and smiting evil... I have done it for thirty years and see no end of it. I have a wonderful wife and two beautiful daughters; the elder would be about your age. I want to go home one day and never leave it again for yet another quest or the Order’s charge...~
@479  = ~I serve Torm and I always thought that my last breath would release me from this servitude. There is so much evil and injustice in this world!~
@480  = ~Kachiko, my allegiance is with Torm. I would not desert my deity for a moment’s weakness.~
@481  = ~Why?~
@482  = ~(*laughs and shakes his head*) Got it all covered, don’t they? And I guess there is an Immortal in charge of the potential husband’s wisdom and intelligence? Sorry, Kachiko, I am not a singsong girl and cannot surrender my faith so easily. ~
@483  = ~Valygar, there is a lack of respect in your words and tone when you speak of your parents. Events took an unfortunate turn after the death of your father, but you should not be so judgmental. You were away for a long time and...~
@484  = ~Still, there were many things that you were not privy to.~
@485  = ~You seem too convinced that your mother had little use for Andreas Corthala. Let me tell you that it is not truth. I am old enough to remember the whispers...~
@486  = ~Your mind is closed and you prefer to feel contempt and loathing rather than understand and forgive mistakes that were made. Suit yourself, ranger.~
@487  = ~You are interested after all?~
@488  = ~So much anger and resentment in one so young. I pity you, Valygar. Now, the tale does involve magic. Still want to hear?~
@489  = ~Your mother arrived in Athkatla with a war ship from a distant part of Zakhara. Your mother’s people were tall, dark and grim, unwilling to share what brought them to Athkatla or knowledge of their land. But they paid with gold and exotic skins...~
@490  = ~Indeed. But all changed when Abyssina met Andreas Corthala. The rumor has it that she asked permission to stay, but was prohibited from doing so. The ship was made ready to sail hastily. It was leaving port when Andreas approached the pier.~
@491  = ~He started a chant and a great bird flew from the ship followed by a swarm of arrows. But the arrows met with an invisible wall and fall into the ocean. Your father’s doing, no doubt. The bird reached the shore safely and transformed into Abyssina.   They were married the very next day.~
@492  = ~You are wrong to allow your family past to overshadow your own future. What will a woman who loves you say when she learns of this embargo?~
@493  = ~Do you understand yourself, Valygar? No family can be complete without children!~
@494  = ~True enough. I have missed many of the important things in my life. I would wish for others to make wiser choices. You are in danger of making a grave mistake and it as my duty to say as much.~
@495  = ~I am on the road because that’s my duty.~
@496  = ~If I were not on the road, Sime, some other husband would not return to his wife, slain by a monster or a bandit and his children would turn fatherless.~
@497  = ~Far too often I waver, Sime. I wish not for you to add to my doubts. Please, allow me some peace.~
@498  = ~I thought you might know a thing or two about lovers’ talk. I miss Maria deeply and I wanted to write her a letter. But I am an old soldier and have little experience with tender words. I know it does not suit me to act like a boy, but really, I need to tell her how of my love.~
@499  = ~By Torm, that’s a jolly good idea, milady!~
@500  = ~So my friend, tell us what has brought so bright a gleam to your eye?~
@501  = ~Oh enough with your horse play! Leina always wants a hot bath let’s get the jump on her first this time. What say you?~
@502  = ~Sssssh. Now listen Leina always wants a bath after a battle and she hasn’t said anything yet so let’s do it first.~
@503  = ~Hey now, listen Leina is always the first to want a bath after a stinkin’ battle so let’s ask her first for a fluffy towel. What say you?~
@504  = ~(*Laughs heartily*) Leina is a clever lass... We are talking about Leina here are we not? Me thinks you are being a little presumptuous with that statement my friend.~
@505  = ~(*Sighing*) I have outgrown such behaviour, but I remember, only just, what it was to be young. I will not spoil the jest.~
@506  = ~That’s not quite what I was expecting, but I can see how it may surprise Leina.~
@507  = ~Leina, child, whereas I am flattered, I go where Torm bids me go and as such, his is the only recognition I seek. Sing of the others as heroes if you must but please, leave my name to me.~
