@0    = ~Students! What do you think you are doing here? Would you care to explain what you are doing outside academy grounds?~
@1    = ~We are on a field trip, collecting spell components but we have not come across anything of use.~
@2    = ~I had no idea students were not permitted off academy grounds.~
@3    = ~Is there some reason students are not permitted to be here?~
@4    = ~I had some free time so I thought I would take a closer look at my surroundings.~
@5    = ~All the spell components necessary for your studies can be obtained on academy grounds. You have no reason to be here, it is not safe.~
@6    = ~I was not told of any such dangers when I arrived, so I am not deliberately ignoring anyone's warnings.~
@7    = ~Not safe you say, in that case, I will return immediately.~
@8    = ~I was about to return anyway. Nothing out here to see but sand.~
@9    = ~Does that mean students are permitted to be here but, as you put it, *it is not safe* for them to be so?~
@10   = ~For their own safety, all students are made aware of the dangers of wandering out of the gates. Why have you chosen to disregard our warnings?~
@11   = ~I do not like your tone and you have a strange attitude for a student. What is your name?~
@12   = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I apologise if I sounded disrespectful but I did not realise there was any danger in being here. I will be making my way back to the academy now. Farewell.~
@13   = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, and I cannot help that you do not like my attitude. Probably best I be returning to the academy now. Farewell.~
@14   = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and as I have said, I am returning to the academy now. I am tired of looking at sand.~
@15   = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I do not hold with being told where it is or is not safe for me to be. Now, if you will excuse me, I have done with looking around and was about to return to the academy.~
@16   = ~Wait a moment! I have not finished speaking with you yet. I sense something in your manner that I have not seen in students before. Come closer so we may truth read you.~
@17   = ~Your hesitation has given me the time to glimpse your real purpose in coming to Halruaa. You are not students but spies for Ulcaster! Fools! Did you really think you could deceive us?~
@18   = ~Now you will pay the price for your deception! (*Turning to one of the accompanying mages*) Run Lon, call for guards.~
