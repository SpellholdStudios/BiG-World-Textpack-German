@0    = ~Please accept my condolences, sir Keldorn.~
@1    = ~(With a sigh) Keldorn... I have known you for quite some years, my friend. You are one of the senior officers of the Order. You had every right to settle this matter yourself. You also showed mercy for your wife which has not gone unnoticed... We tried your case, paladin Keldorn Firecam, and we decided that you have done everything in your power to save this woman's soul.~
@2    = ~I take it you will stay in the city only long enough to formulise the divorce?~
@3    = ~Yes. After such disgraceful behaviour, she simply can not remain the wife of a paladin. Your marriage is annulled.~
@4    = ~You have nothing to blame yourself for Keldorn. Continue your travelling with <CHARNAME>, but do not stay here long... soon the gossip will quieten down and it will be over and done with. We will insist that Maria leaves Amn, and soon.~
@5    = ~Keldorn's daughters have passed away, his marriage is dissolved. I must do my best to ease the pain of my paladin.~
