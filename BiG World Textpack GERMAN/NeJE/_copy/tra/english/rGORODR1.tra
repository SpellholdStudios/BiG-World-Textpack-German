@0    = ~I have done you a great misdeed.  My pride told me I could not be sacrificed, but that... a Bhaalspawn... it... it was a grievous wrong.  Can you forgive a foolish man?~
@1    = ~I hope you think on this, Odren.  I understand why you thought this was necessary, though... even if it was wrong.~
@2    = ~I hope your god forgives you, Odren, because I won't.  Not ever.  Get out of my sight!~
@3    = ~Forgive you?  I suppose... if your reward is large enough.~
@4    = ~Forgive you?  Forget it, fool!  Payback's a bitch!!~
@5    = ~Come, my brethren!  We go on a pilgrimage, now... we must atone for our wrongs and redeem ourselves.  Farewell, <GABBER>.  If we meet again, may it be under fairer circumstances.~
@6    = ~Watcher's Keep

The Imprisoned One held within the vault that is Watcher's Keep turned out to be none other than Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons, himself.  I was able to defeat the creature and send it back to the Abyss...and then confront Odren outside of the Keep.  He admitted that he had known of Demogorgon's presence...his plan had been for me to seal myself inside the prison along with the demon instead of them.  Odren was remorseful for his blatant cowardice, however, and I decided not to seek retribution.~
