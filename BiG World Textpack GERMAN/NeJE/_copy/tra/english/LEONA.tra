@1    = ~How dare you patronize us, daddy! You never thought about us, we were indifferent to you, you.~
@2    = ~Mommy?! So, you have remembered her? You have been away from home for months, but when Sir William began to watch after us, you came and made him leave! I wish Sir William were our father, not you. It is good that we were killed, and don't have to witness you marrying this...~
@3    = ~You couldn't find our murderers, and you didn't even avenge us.~
@4    = ~It is not true! You were there, but you came back because of her! You did everything for her! You left us to die because of her.~
