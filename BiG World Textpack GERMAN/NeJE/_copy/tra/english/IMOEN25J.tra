@0    = ~(Annoyingly) <CHARNAME>, <CHARNAME>, so tell me! I saw you sleeping together. So how is he, huh? And how are you? You liked it, didn't ya?~
@1    = ~(Whispering in your ear) Listen, does he really have a beautiful and brawny body, that's what I think, does he? Does he?~
@2    = ~(Turning red) Imoen! You should be ashamed of yourself. Yes, we slept together, but I'm not going to tell you a thing...you shameless little...~
@3    = ~(You're looking around in order to check whether Keldorn can hear you) C'mon, let's go where we can talk. Listen, I really did like it! You were right, it was great! (You're looking around again, whispering in to Imoen's ear afterwards) He's much more beautiful without his clothes.~
@4    = ~What are you up to Imoen? You should take care of yourself, not be spying on others!~
@5    = ~(Making fun of you) Shameless person... It's you who is really shameless. You are not even married to him. And don't be all saints with me, sister.~
@6    = ~(Her eyes are glowing brightly) Oh, I so want to see him, at least with one eye! But you are even bathing in your clothes.~
@7    = ~Oh, you can't imagine how much I envy you, <CHARNAME>. There is much more divinity in you, and what a great man you've got for yourself, and look at me... always the younger sister.~
@8    = ~(Pouting) You are so mean!~
