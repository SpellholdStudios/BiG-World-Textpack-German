@0    = ~I’ll stay around the ship and keep an eye on the shifty captain for you...~
@1    = ~Great, stay with the ship then, I do not fully trust Saemon. It might easily be his own plot to get the cash and avoid a dangerous sailing to Spellhold. Stay right where you are and call if Havarian will be up to no good.~
@2    = ~I will stay here for the time being and you can always count on my help.~
