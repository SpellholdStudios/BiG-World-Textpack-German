@0    = ~Then tell me straight: what happened to your friends.~
@1    = ~And it used this device to destroy your friends?~
@2    = ~And it deafeated them without any effort at all?~
@3    = ~They entered and challenged it, and it stared and did nothing. For a moment they didn't know what to do, and then it made a simple gesture with its hand, and all the hells broke loose. It created doubles of them all, and laughed as they literally killed themselves. I heard Ginny screaming loudest. I think she actually killed her double, but couldn't handle the fact that she had to. She was the youngest... They didn't know, and they missed the one shot they may have had...~
@4    = ~And what fell magic did it use to do this? ~
@5    = ~Why did you come if you think this creature unbeatable?~
@6    = ~And what is this 'one shot' of which you speak? You have already said that you think the creature cannot be beaten.~
@7    = ~Weaklings. I will assault the creature head-on and destroy him before he realizes!~
@8    = ~You... you made it! Did any of... no, all my friends are dead, aren't they? Ginny's mother will kill me as surely as this place would have. At... at least the Demonknight has been stopped. I hope we've seen that last of his kind...it worries me though. I have heard they serve powerful beings even more evil than they, if such a thing is possible. I... I'd better go.~
@9    = ~Clair seemed rather amazed that I defeated the demonknight. Perhaps so was I. A pity her friends could not be saved. A harsh lesson about knowing your boundaries.~
@10   = ~You... you made it! Ginny ran out faster than I've ever seen her move. Did anyone else... no, they are dead, aren't they? At least Ginny's mother will sleep well tonight. I doubt she'll be going on any more adventures anytime soon. Neither will I, for that matter. At least you stopped the demonknight, though... though it worries me. I have heard that such creatures serve powerful beings even more evil than they, as if such a thing were possible. I... I should go. ~
@11   = ~Clair seemed rather amazed that I defeated the demonknight, and perhaps so was I. She was also happy that at least one of her friends made it out alive. A small thing in the face of so much death, but we take our victories where we can.~
