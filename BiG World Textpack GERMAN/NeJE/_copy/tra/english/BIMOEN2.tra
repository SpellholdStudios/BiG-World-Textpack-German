@0    = ~(Shudders) Yes, Kachiko it was an awful place, run by an insane madman... I thought that I would never be able to sleep peacefully again... ~
@1    = ~My wounds are deep and my pain is not passing. I just cannot be my old self again. But I am grateful for your kind words. We... we should catch up with the rest of the group, Kachiko.~
@2    = ~And both are absolutely gorgeous goddesses! And, Valygar, you are leaving out the most interesting part. Which one of us you like the better?~
@3    = ~(Laughs) You do not have to answer. But I am not just gorgeous I am also generous. I will tell you something you will probably be interested in hearing. The lights were bad in Spellhold, but I think I spotted <CHARNAME> blush when she mumbled: "Valygar, the ranger, my new trusted friend..."~
@4    = ~Nope, I just made it up. I wanted to check my theory. I think you got a thing for her...~
@5    = ~Oh, really? How exciting, I know something, which has not happened yet...~
@6    = ~Nope, Sime. I'm fine at last. Just tryin' to shake off the nightmares. I was just thinkin' on how many new faces are around. Yours for instance.~
@7    = ~Must have been complaining about <PRO_HISHER> "little troublemaker" as usual. <CHARNAME> never noticed that I grew up, I am afraid.~
@8    = ~Jaheira says I look silly when I smile. Well, actually her exact words were "sillier than usual".~
@9    = ~(Pssst) I do not steal, Sime, I just look. Don't ya wanna know what each of them might be carrying around in secret?~
@10   = ~Aerie carries a mirror and... blush!~
@11   = ~Korgan carries a a book entitled "How to Make Friends and Influence Other People".~
@12   = ~Guess what our somber ranger carries? A laced lady's glove!~
@13   = ~Nope!~
@14   = ~Oh, my dear Mystra, just look at that! Anomen has...~
@15   = ~Cernd has some sort of seeds here. And bark. And pebbles.~
@16   = ~Jan has a turnip, no two turnips... three... ten...~
@17   = ~Yoshimo has nothing, but his weapons and this other stuff he is carrying for <CHARNAME>.~
@18   = ~Kachiko has a lock of dark hair!~
@19   = ~Nalia has some sort of blueprints. Looks like it is her castle.~
@20   = ~Keldorn has a pipe and smoking weed. But I have never seen him smoking!~
@21   = ~Mazzy has high-heeled shoes!~
@22   = ~Jaheira has a portrait of Khalid.~
@23   = ~Well, he carries Boo, cheese for Boo, peanuts for Boo and carrots for Boo...~
@24   = ~"How I Became an Evil Overlord" by Edwin Odesseiron.~
@25   = ~I am afraid to pick-pocket Viconia. If she wakes up, she'll kill me on spot.~
@26   = ~(*She looks at the two girls and walks hesitantly towards them*) Hi you two, all ready to hit the road?~
@27   = ~I... you said there wasn’t as much gold as you were expecting so we should open the other chest, maybe there would be gems or jewels in it. Don’t you remember Melora?~
@28   = ~Yeah... well... whilst you were collecting the gold you told me to go open the other one, we needed more than was in the first. It was trapped, and a pretty nasty one at that.~
@29   = ~The explosion brought the fat lord running in, he was screaming and waving this huge sword about. So I turned us all invisible and we high tailed it out of there!~
@30   = ~You should have seen his face, one minute he thought he’d caught us and the next... *poof*, we were gone.~
@31   = ~Yep, we dropped it off on our way back, hid it in a flour sack so she should find it soon enough.~
@32   = ~(*Her face turns a somewhat shade paler*) Yeah, I hope you remember real soon Melora, but don’t push it, these things have to come on their own.~
@33   = ~(*Then shrugging  her shoulders*) Why worry about the guards Leina? I guess what it boils down to, is that they should have been more careful in choosing their employer.~
@34   = ~Ooops... <CHARNAME> is looking our way, <PRO_HESHE> has an uncanny knack of knowing when I’m trying to hide something. So lets smile sweetly at <PRO_HIMHER>, girls, and make as if we’re ready to leave.~
@35   = ~You... you mean you don’t remember anything Melora?~
@36   = ~We were doing ok, the guards were down easy as pie, the first chest almost empty then *BOOM*, the second one exploded and you got hit by a lump of flying chest. It must have been trapped, and a pretty nasty one at that.~
@37   = ~I... you said there wasn’t as much gold as you were expecting so we should open the second chest, maybe there would be gems or jewels in it. Don’t you remember Melora?~
@38   = ~The explosion brought the fat lord running in, he was screaming and waving this huge sword about. So I turned us both  invisible and we high tailed it out of there!~
@39   = ~(*Her face turning a somewhat shade paler*) Yeah, I hope you remember really soon but don’t push it Melora, these things have to come on their own.~
@40   = ~Ooops... <CHARNAME> is looking our way, let’s just smile sweetly at <PRO_HIMHER> and make as if we’re ready to leave.~
@41   = ~Mmm... maybe we should just keep out of <PRO_HISHER> way for a bit. <CHARNAME> has an uncanny knack of knowing when I’m trying to hide something.~
@42   = ~(*Both girls immediately turn their attention to finishing their packing, confident that they can blend into the shadows and avoid any questions for the next day or two.~
@43   = ~(*Rolling her eyes*) What... you.. an idea?  May the gods protect us.~
@44   = ~Oh enough with your horse play! Leina always wants a hot bath let’s get the jump on her first this time. What say you?~
@45   = ~Sssssh. Now listen Leina always wants a bath after a battle and she hasn’t said anything yet so let’s do it first.~
@46   = ~Hey now, listen Leina is always the first to want a bath after a stinkin’ battle so let’s ask her first for a fluffy towel. What say you?~
@47   = ~(*Giggles*) That’ll be the day when you get one over on her, <CHARNAME>.~
@48   = ~(*Her eyes gleam with mischief*) Ooo... at last, we are going to have some fun! Spill the plan, <CHARNAME>?~
@49   = ~(*Excitedly*) Ooo, yes, let’s! She is so excited about her music, for once she has forgotten about a warm fluffy towel. I can’t wait to see her face when you suggest a bath, <CHARNAME>!~
@50   = ~(*Her eyes light up*) Oh yes sing about me... you must. Imoen, the slayer of foul beast, mistress of the bow  and sleight of hand.~
@51   = ~Leina, I'm liking you more and more. With <CHARNAME> it is always push, push and sleeping in a cave or the mud. That gets pretty hard on a girls nimble fingers, not to mention her other unmentionable parts.~
@52   = ~Minsc, you can tell Boo not to fret, I have just the thing to untangle a girl's hair when it becomes wayward and I am sure it will work just as well on hamster fur.~
@53   = ~<CHARNAME> says I look silly when I smile. Well, actually <PRO_HISHER> exact words were "sillier than usual".~
@54   = ~So, the bard Leina appears to have stolen my newly found brothers heart.~
@55   = ~(*She tosses her head back and laughs*) Fear not Imoen, for your brother’s heart is still his own.~
@56   = ~(*Studying the bard’s face*) So you telling me that this isn’t love that I sense between you and <CHARNAME>? Pull the other one Leina, I may have lost my soul but I still got my eyes!~
@57   = ~(*Her expression becomes serious*) Imoen, know that my love for <CHARNAME> is of the friendship kind, my true love lies with my music.~
@58   = ~I will not be so naive as to trust my heart to a man again, my music keeps me content in a way that nothing else can.~
@59   = ~(*Her eyes light up but she tries to make her face appear tragic*) Ooh, I sense a real tale of tragedy here, of love unrequited.~
@60   = ~Please tell Leina, what manner of beast took your heart and dashed it upon the rocks, leaving it broken, scarred for the whole of eternity?~
@61   = ~(*She smiles at the young girls romantic interpretation of her life*) Ay Imoen, I took a man once, called him husband, loved him, worshipped him, only to have my heart broken, my dreams shattered in return.~
@62   = ~When my heart finally became whole again, I promised it I would never allow it to suffer such pain again, I swore an oath never to love or to allow a man’s love to ever touch it again.~
@63   = ~(*She looks at Leina, with genuine sadness in her face*) To never love again, how... I mean... never?~
@64   = ~(*She looks at Imoen and smiles*) Please Imoen, no sad face for me. Love truly doesn’t interest me anymore, I have all I need in my music. So come, be happy for me.~
@65   = ~Don’t you miss the comfort that comes from being loved back, from knowing that someone thinks you are special?~
@66   = ~You of all people know the pain of having a part of you torn away. Would you want to risk the same pain when you are finally made whole again?~
@67   = ~If I never again let a man into my heart then I know also that pain and deceit will never enter it either.~
@68   = ~But surely you don’t believe that all men are the same, there are some good honest men in the world. <CHARNAME> to name but one.~
@69   = ~Ah Imoen, I see this love you hold for your brother is very dear, but I live for my music, and nothing will sway me from that.~
@70   = ~Never again will I be tricked by false feelings and deceit again. No, I will not be fooled twice. Music has the ability to lighten the heart where love has the ability to kill it.~
@71   = ~Love can also heal it you know Leina.~
@72   = ~You have much trust in love, and no doubt if I had only your happy experiences of it then I would be a different person to who I am today.~
@73   = ~As it is, the strength and wisdom I have gained through my struggle has helped me to see that this thing called love that we all seek, is not destined for us all.~
@74   = ~I swore off love to protect my heart and in truth, I have never been happier. You search for love if it is what you dream of Imoen, but do so with open eyes and remember, that  there are none so blind as those blinded by love.~
