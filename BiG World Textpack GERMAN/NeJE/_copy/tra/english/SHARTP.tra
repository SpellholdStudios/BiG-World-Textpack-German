@0    = ~Damn it, you lose one well-fought duel to an oafish lout of a man and you get attached. I almost hate to say it but you've earned my respect.~
@1    = ~Ah, I'm finally released from this infernal duty! I swear by every god in a million pantheons that I will NEVER lose a duel to another overly masculine thug in my life.~
@2    = ~You have returned. That is fortunate, as I do not feel I have truly paid my debt to you just yet.~
@3    = ~A debt you have, but I do not wish to collect at this time.  Prehaps later.~
@4    = ~I do have need of you, but not because of your debt.  You skill is invaluable to me.~
@5    = ~Make no mistake; I follow you only because of your prowess in battle. When that falters, so does my loyalty.~
@6    = ~Do not try my patience!  I will wait for a time, but I have no tolerance of ungrateful winners.~
