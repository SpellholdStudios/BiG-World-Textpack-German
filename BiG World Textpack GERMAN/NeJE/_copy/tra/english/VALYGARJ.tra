@0    = ~Something about this place reminds me of my family... Undead mages, twisted honor. I expect my mother to appear every minute dragging my zombied father along... Did I tell you I had to kill them both to stop my mother’s madness? Still gives me creeps. Let’s be done quickly and be out of here.~
@1    = ~Stay away from her, vampire! You and your murderous bastard of a brother had taken too many lives as is. I will not allow you to harm <CHARNAME>...~
@2    = ~Your eyes stop on Valygar. "It is a rare sight," you think suddenly, since the ranger spends the most of his  time scouting ahead of the party or guarding the flanks or watching the rear... or one of those endless things rangers do and which all by some reason or another require them to disappear from view. May be you should seize this opportunity to interact with him?~
@3    = ~You try to sneak up on Valygar from behind and cover his eyes with your palms...~
@4    = ~"Valygar, how are you faring?"~
@5    = ~"Do you not feel lonely sometimes, Valygar?"~
@6    = ~You come up to Valygar quietly and walk beside him in silence.~
@7    = ~You study Valygar’s face while he is preoccupied with his task.~
@8    = ~You blow Valygar a kiss.~
@9    = ~You throw a pinecone you were saving for the last three days for that particular purpose into him.~
@10   = ~You murmur under your breath: "Gods be good, he is quite a stallion that one".~
@11   = ~You do nothing.~
@12   = ~No, do not waste your words. Perhaps not all magic is evil, <CHARNAME>. But Irenicus is worse than anything Lavok ever was, I am sure of it. I would ask you to stay here in safety and wait until I return with the head of the mad mage... But I know, that I’d have to tie you up to keep you out of this battle. So I will not suggest it. I accept the same courtesy of you. We will fight for your soul, <CHARNAME> side by side. I am ready to die for your cause if need be. Besides, sending yet another wizard to Abyss is a pleasure, not labor for Valygar Corthala. Let us go.~
@13   = ~You follow Valygar as stealthily as you can, and as you finally gain on him and raise your arms... Valygar whirls around suddenly, catches you by your waist and lifts you high into the air, laughing: "Nice try, <CHARNAME>!"~
@14   = ~Quite well, thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@15   = ~I do. Care to keep me company for a while?~
@16   = ~Slowly Valygar gets a hold of your hand. You both stop suddenly and he looks onto your upturned face... Gently his palm squeezes your fingers. "<CHARNAME>..." Valygar says quietly.~
@17   = ~You did not mean for this to happen, but your eyes meet... for a moment he looks at you and something in his gaze makes you blush and your heart race.~
@18   = ~Valygar presses his right palm to his heart and bows, smiling: "You are very kind, My Lady".~
@19   = ~"I’m going to get you!" Now, of course it is not the most mature thing to do, and it can damage your reputation as a party leader, but you find yourself running away giggling like mad, with Valygar at your heels...~
@20   = ~Valygar grins. There was no way in the Nine Hells that he could have heard you! Or was there?~
@21   = ~Valygar disappears into the shadows again... another time perhaps?~
@22   = ~Before you can help it your mind wanders away from the problems of the day and you think about Valygar. You remember him sitting by your feet near a campfire or the way he seems never to loose your sight in battle, ready to rush to your side at any moment. Sometimes you even suspect that he might be in love with you. Though you did not mean to, you say his name out loud. Presently, he turns towards you: "<CHARNAME>?"~
@23   = ~"I was thinking about you..."~
@24   = ~"Ahem... it was nothing important, really... "~
@25   = ~"Do you have some water left in your water skin? I have run out..."~
@26   = ~You point in whatever direction: "Cowled wizard!"~
@27   = ~You take a hold of Valygar’s hands: "Valygar, you are a fine companion"~
@28   = ~"Hmm... here you are! I lost you for a moment..."~
@29   = ~"Do you like my name?"~
@30   = ~"Valygar, about this Corthala curse thing which makes you to ignore women... I think you are overreacting it."~
@31   = ~"And I was thinking about you, <CHARNAME>. How strange..."~
@32   = ~Valygar laughs and pats you on the shoulder: "Do you think I am a dragon or something? Common, what can I do for you?"~
@33   = ~"Of course". When you are finished drinking he leans towards you, and kisses a drop off your cheek: "No need to waste the sweet water, <CHARNAME>". ~
@34   = ~Catches you hand and kisses your palm: "You are such unskilled liar, <CHARNAME>!"~
@35   = ~"And you are a fine leader, <CHARNAME>."~
@36   = ~"No wonder you cannot see well, with all this hair falling into your eyes..." He brushes the loose strands of hair away from your face. "Now, that’s better."~
@37   = ~"<CHARNAME>? I love..." he hesitates for a moment and then finishes: "your name."~
@38   = ~Valygar looks at you sadly: "I don’t overreact, <CHARNAME>. I am a danger for any woman mad enough to care about me. And I do not ignore women, though I wish I could sometimes. The more I love someone, the more I wish to protect her... to stay away. You do understand, don’t you?"~
@39   = ~Valygar mutters under his breath: "Nine Hells, I am starting to imagine things already! Of course she did not call upon you, you old fool!"~
@40   = ~Sometimes people mask their feelings so well or imagine non-existent obstacles... You picked up a daisy another day and you plucked away its petals: "He loves me, he loves me not..." until only one is left.  You wonder if daisies know anything about grim rangers.~
@41   = ~"Valygar, I have a daisy here and it is her expert opinion that you are in love with me."~
@42   = ~"Do you think that flowers can lie, Valygar?"~
@43   = ~"I am very flattered by your attention lately, Valygar. You have a gentle heart, I was surprised to discover."~
@44   = ~"I was wondering what do you think about me, Valygar? Someone was giving me ideas..."~
@45   = ~You stuff what was left of the daisy into Valygar’s palm.~
@46   = ~You come up to Valygar, and muss his hair: "Here, you looked way too stiff. Don’t you ever let your guard down? Or stop to smell flowers?"~
@47   = ~You show Valygar the daisy with a single petal left on it from a distance and mouth: "He loves me" voicelessly.~
@48   = ~You throw the daisy away.~
@49   = ~Valygar grumbles: "Expert opinion indeed...", but the shine of his eyes as he looks at you serves to confirm the daisy’s verdict.~
@50   = ~"I do not know, <CHARNAME>..." Valygar looks surprised by your question, but than notices the flower in your hand and smiles at you.~
@51   = ~Valygar takes your hand and sighs:  "I thought you can use a bit of gentleness m’lady. The destiny is too rough on you." ~
@52   = ~The ranger replies without a moment’s hesitation: "I think that you are wonderful, smart and beautiful..." It sounds almost like a prayer on his lips.~
@53   = ~Valygar looks at the ruined flower in surprise: "<CHARNAME>, you are such a child sometimes!"~
@54   = ~Valygar shakes his head in astonishment: "That’s what I get for taking the helmet off for a moment? Makes me wonder about what will happen should I remove gauntlets or boots or... I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, this is not fit for the ears of a lady."~
@55   = ~Valygar looks back at you and you can swear that you can hear his heart pounding.~
@56   = ~Valygar picks the flower up: "<CHARNAME>, you have dropped something... Oh... So does he love you or does he not? He better be good to you!"~
@57   = ~You are shivering, my dear. I will stoke the fire, though I fear your chill is not a fault of the air.~
@58   = ~No, it isn't. Stand back, Valygar, I don't know if I can protect you from this.~
@59   = ~You endanger yourself being here. Move, for your own good.~
@60   = ~Get away from me, fool. You endanger your worthless life!~
@61   = ~Your lips move, but no sound emerges. Are you sure you are well... <CHARNAME>? By the gods, <CHARNAME>!!~
@62   = ~Ah, I thought my days in the military were done, now I fear I shall also be mobilized.~
@63   = ~Hm, it would appear that I am dead. Well, the hell with it.~
@64   = ~Valygar! You died by my hand Valygar! Believe me, I did not mean it... please forgive me.~
@65   = ~The hell with it? Then let it be so.~
@66   = ~<CHARNAME>? You killed me? Ah, I see... I'm not angry with you. Though I do not approve of foul magic... and look where it has led us to, you could not help yourself. Still, let's forget it and leave this place.~
@67   = ~(Shrugs his shoulders) You killed me, <CHARNAME>. Ah, I see... I'm not angry with you. Though I do not approve of foul magic... and look where it has led us to, you could not help yourself. Still, let's forget it and leave this place.~
@68   = ~See the contempt with which this young woman treats this man‘s heart, she throws scorn on his words and gift? I cannot believe a man would have written such as this if this Leina had not encouraged him in some way. Women are so fickle!~
@69   = ~A ruined academy of magic, now we get to see first hand the havoc mages cause.~
@70   = ~Yea Gods, <CHARNAME>!! You are seriously thinking of dragging me to a place swarming with wizards?! I shudder at the mere thought of such a place.~
@71   = ~If any of those wizards as much as looks at me and makes any hand gestures in my direction, I swear by all that I hold dear, I will not be responsible for my actions!~
@72   = ~I can sense the foul taint of magic around this place before we even set foot on its soil. I say it is not too late to turn back before it corrupts us all.~
@73   = ~It is too late Valygar, we can only go forward now until the time Tilorn brings us home.~
@74   = ~And go where Valygar? Look around you, there is only dessert as far as the eye can see.~
@75   = ~It was your choice to follow me ranger. I would appreciate it if you please, try and not scowl so at the mages whilst we are here.~
@76   = ~Please Valygar, try to look and act like you are a mage. Our lives depend on you not acting hastily whilst we are here.~
@77   = ~I fear I may not be able to keep this pretense up for too long. I have little patience or love for wizards and their black arts.~
@78   = ~I‘m with Melora. You can never be sure what is going to come out of the mouth of a wizard! Best not to let them so much as open it!~
@79   = ~Both of you shut up before someone dies, and I‘m not promising that it will be the mages!~
@80   = ~You both knew what would be expected from you when you agreed to come here. Now if neither of you can cope with it leave before we enter the Academy.~
@81   = ~I am not going to risk the lives of the rest of the group. If you two cannot see past your phobias for a while do us all a favor and leave now.~
@82   = ~Melora, Valygar if you wish to remain with the group then at least try and act like mages.~
@83   = ~Nor do I Melora, nor do I, but I will try to be more prudent whilst we are here <CHARNAME>.~
@84   = ~I hope so Hrothgar for I fear I may not be able to keep this pretense up for too long. I have little patience or love for wizards and their black arts.~
@85   = ~Poetic justice I say, a mage ending up as spell components.~
@86   = ~As long as her tongue speak I say we don’t give her a chance to use it!~
@87   = ~Trusting a wizard and their black arts was always going to end badly for you gnome.~
