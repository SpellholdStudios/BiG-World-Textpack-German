@1    = ~Keldorn, you remember? This was near the place where we were attacked by that crazy priest of Cyric!~
@2    = ~Priest of Cyric? Their sect is very strong here in Athkatla. I just can't understand the reasons their sudden hatred for you, lord Keldorn. To the best of my knowledge the Order has not organized any punitive actions recently, is that so?~
