@1    = ~There! More of that damnable Bodhi's goons! The fight is falling out of our favor! Fall back, fall back to the guild and we will prepare for another day!~
@2    = ~You damnable fool! I would rid these creatures from our streets for the safety of us all! You've tipped the balance, so deal with the monsters yourselves! Retreat!~
