@0    = ~<CHARNAME> has probably forgotten that this is my expedition. I came here looking for evil forces to destroy them. And I am going to continue my mission with or without you.~
@1    = ~I understand it is too dangerous for you and your companions. Moreover, you don’t belong to my world. You are strangers in our lands, and I shall not blame you turning away from me.~
@2    = ~Sorry, Hrothgar. You are right. We shall continue on our mission. You lost many friends to come here, and we will not turn away from you.~
@3    = ~Whatever.~
@4    = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@5    = ~<CHARNAME>, I really don’t like your tone. Are you serious? Why do you insult the hero druid? Why do you insult the old dying man? ~
@6    = ~Sorry, Hrothgar. It’s my fault. I didn’t intend to be rude with him. I’m really nervous about everything behind this portal.~
@7    = ~It’s not your buisness.~
@8    = ~I trust you, <CHARNAME>. Unfortunately, we cannot help him right now, but he will be avenged. I promise.~
@9    = ~We were lucky surviving in the avalanche. But I mourn the loss of my people.~
@10   = ~We follow the righteous path, the path of Helm.~
@11   = ~If this is the cavern of undead that Mother Egenia spoke of then we must be getting close to the snake queen’s lair.~
@12   = ~Curioser and curiouser. This puzzle develops a new twist at every turn.~
@13   = ~Agreed. I wonder who this “Old Enemy” is, and how we fit into this new recipe?~
@14   = ~Nervy or not, it’s just another enemy to dispatch.~
@15   = ~Marchon, what are you doing here?~
@16   = ~No problem. So tell me did you hear something about disturbances in Kuldahar Pass? Or do you know something about the Heartstone Gem?~
@17   = ~It is true Dar, I do not know where this may lead us. All I do know is that it is a necessary step that I must take. You do have the choice as to whether you take it with us or not. I do know that <CHARNAME> has come to regard you as an ally that <PRO_HESHE> can depend on and <PRO_HESHE> will sorely miss you should you decide to remain here.~ [HROT_48]
@18   = ~Thank the gods, <CHARNAME>! Come catch your breath. When we arrived in this strange place, which has all the appearances of a dungeon of sorts, you were not with us. Now, a minute or so after us you fall out of the portal quite breathless. You had me worried for a moment or two, can you tell me what happened to you?~ [HROT_51]
@19   = ~(*agitated*) I am not sure, Hrothgar. It... it was the strangest feeling, more like a dream than reality. I was back in Candlekeep! I saw myself in Candlekeep and you, Hrothgar, you were there, I saw you with Gorion, talking to him about the balance and how you were feeling the effects that this was having on The Realms! I could not understand what you were saying Hrothgar, it was so... so...~
@20   = ~I am not sure, Hrothgar. It... it was the strangest feeling, more like a dream than reality. I don’t know... Tell me, Hrothgar, have you met Gorion before?~
@21   = ~Calm yourself, <CHARNAME>. It was clearly a hallucination... travelling these portals causes such upsets in the mind at times. You are safe and well, which is all that matters. Take another second to regain your breath, and then we must continue on as it looks as though we still have a way to go before we are free.~ [HROT_52]
@22   = ~Gorion? Hmm... I remember you told he was your foster father, but I doubt I have ever met him before. Anyway, we should move.~ [HROT_53]
@23   = ~This... this looks all wrong! The city, it... it is wrong! Tell me quickly <CHARNAME>, what year would this be?~ [HROT_54]
@24   = ~It is 1369 Hrothgar. What do you mean the city is wrong?~
@25   = ~The year Hrothgar? It is 1369, why do you say "the city is wrong"? I admit it is strange to us, but are we not strangers to it ourselves?~
@26   = ~It is 1369 Hrothgar, and compared to where we have just come from, this city looks damn good to me!~
@27   = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I did not mean to say that the city is wrong. Where we are is wrong, the date is wrong, we have arrived too late!~ [HROT_55]
@28   = ~Too late? Too late for what Hrothgar?~
@29   = ~First you say that the city is wrong and now you say that it is the date that is wrong! Will you tell me exactly what it is that is wrong Hrothgar?~
@30   = ~You look anxious my friend. What exactly is it that we are too late for and if not here where should we be?~
@31   = ~Too late? What are you talking about? This is the year that we left and I for one see nothing wrong with where we are as long as we are free.~
@32   = ~It is nothing, <CHARNAME>. I... I just need to be allowed to think on what is to be done now.~ [HROT_56]
@33   = ~<CHARNAME>, I did not mean...~
@34   = ~"What is to be done now", Hrothgar? I think "what is to be done now" is that we look for Imoen before it is also "too late" for her! That is "what is to be done now". My blood turns cold at thoughts of what he may be subjecting her to this very minute!~
@35   = ~What is to be done?

After asking what the present year is and my answering him Hrothgar mumbled something about it being the wrong date, that he was too late and that he would have to think about what is to be done. I could scarce believe my ears... what is to be done? What is it with this man... Imoen is in the clutches of a mad wizard and strange cowled mages and he has to think about what is to be done? I know what is to be done and as soon as I get my head around this... so will he!~
@36   = ~I know "what is to be done now", I intend to hunt down this Irenicus and pay him back a piece of his own for what he has put me through!~
@37   = ~Imoen is my priority here, Hrothgar! I mean to rescue her from the clutches of that mad man. I have felt what he is capable of and will not have her endure his cruel torture a minute longer than is necessary. There is no "let me think on this!"~
@38   = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, just let me think!~ [HROT_57]
@39   = ~(*Suddenly stopping you in your tracks.*) <CHARNAME>, I have decided. As I am too late to speak with the sages at Ulcaster Academy, then I must visit Ulcaster ruins, near Beregost.~ [HROT_58A]
@40   = ~I will ask that you accompany me and maybe we shall find some clue as to the whereabouts of the key. Yes, I believe that is the logical step to take and the sooner the better.~ [HROT_58B]
@41   = ~I know where Ulcaster is, Hrothgar, I have been there myself. You talk of keys, wrong dates and what you must do, then you ask me to join you on your quest without a second thought for Imoen. Well, it is going to take a bit more than vague notions of finding some keys before I abandon her to god knows what fate. Imoen and I have been through a lot together, and she at least deserves to be considered here. I owe her that much, and Irenicus a lot more.~
@42   = ~I am not about to let that mage slip through my fingers so easily, Hrothgar, I owe him for what he has put both Imoen and myself through. Ulcaster is nowhere near the direction that I must take to find them, that I am sure of, so what more can you tell me about this search for keys that will convince me to travel with you?~
@43   = ~This may be the wrong date for you, Hrothgar, but it is the right one for me to find and exact my revenge on that mad mage. Imoen will have to look out for herself until I can get to wherever it is that he is keeping her, it is him that I want. He will pay for the torture that he subjected me to in that infernal dungeon of his for some reason only his twisted mind knows! How can Ulcaster and your keys help me to do this Hrothgar?~
@44   = ~Imoen will be found in time, <CHARNAME>, you can be assured of this so there is no reason to feel that you are abandoning her.~ [HROT_59A]
@45   = ~As for revenge, well that is a bitter reason to act on and only causes more pain in the long run.~ [HROT_59B]
@46   = ~I believe that you <CHARNAME>, are meant to aid me in my quest and the path that the Gods put us on will not be denied. You may choose to call it fate but it is the same thing. So do we make for Ulcaster now?~ [HROT_59C]
@47   = ~Imoen will be found "in time", what do you mean, Hrothgar, by "in time"? You speak as though you know this for a certainty. How can you know this Hrothgar? Who are you that speaks with a voice that knows so much but is prepared to say so little? Do you know more of this Irenicus than you are telling?~
@48   = ~You say that Imoen will be found and expect that to be enough? How can you be that sure of your words unless you have some dealings with this Irenicus? Is that how you know so much Hrothgar? I do not believe that is so but what else do you expect me to believe when you are being so evasive?~
@49   = ~Damn you man! Have you made a pact with Irenicus? Is that where your certainty comes from? If you value your life you will answer me now!~
@50   = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I have no dealings with Irenicus, there may be others that do but I do not! As for how I know that Imoen will be found, it is something that I know and you will have to trust me that I am speaking the truth. More I cannot say.~ [HROT_60]
@51   = ~(*interrupts Hrothgar angrily*) Trust you, Hrothgar? You ask me to trust you when you are reluctant to say why I should abandon Imoen and follow you! What is that you are doing Hrothgar? Why all the secrecy surrounding these "keys" and what are their purpose? More to the point who is this Tilorn that Arundel spoke of? If he knows so much surely he should be the one to look to for help? Am I going to get some answers Hrothgar?~
@52   = ~Do I trust Hrothgar? 

The audacity of this man Hrothgar! He now asks that I abandon Imoen and join him on a journey to Ulcaster ruins to seek a key... no reasons just, *I have decided*. My protests at his callousness in suggesting I abandon her are met with the words... *Imoen will be found in time... trust the word of Hrothgar*. Trust he says and he not giving me any clues as to what is going on or even how he knows that Imoen will be found... and in what time, I ask myself, will she be found in? Given that I almost believe that this evasive man may be capable of bending time to his will... it is a question I am almost afraid to ask. The other alternative, and one I do not even wish to consider, is that he is in league with Irenicus and this is yet more torment visited upon me... will I never be left to live my life in peace?~
@53   = ~I am finding it very difficult to trust you, Hrothgar! You say that you believe that I am to help you in your quest, that fate has a hand in all this and that I should just go along with what you say. What if our fate is what we make it Hrothgar? What if fate can be changed and that I believe finding Imoen is the right thing for me to do? Is there something that you can tell me about the importance of these keys that will give me cause to think that indeed my fate is in your hands, Hrothgar, can you? Arundel spoke of someone named Tilorn, it sounds to me that he is the man that you should be asking not me?~
@54   = ~Mysterious keys, wrong place, wrong time, you really expect me to jump into action on so few words? I would suggest that you seek out this Tilorn that the old druid spoke of. Maybe he will help you. Or does he have more sense, is that why he is not here?~
@55   = ~Tilorn cannot help me, <CHARNAME>, but you can. There is nothing that I can add to what I have already said. I beseech you to trust me and aid me in this.~ [HROT_61]
@56   = ~Out of respect for you, Hrothgar, I will consider what you say although you have given me no reason to do so. I suggest we sleep on it for now.~
@57   = ~There is still a lot that you have left unsaid, Hrothgar, but you have not proven untrustworthy so far. I will think on what you have asked. Ask me again tomorrow.~
@58   = ~You dance around your answers to my questions, Hrothgar! I have learnt to be wary of such men, but still, I will at least consider what you ask. Now leave me be.~
@59   = ~You have not been forthcoming with your answers, Hrothgar, and every fibre in my being is crying out for me not to abandon Imoen, you have not proven to be untrustworthy so far. I pride myself on being a fair judge of men and I see no malice in you, only the desire to do that which you believe to be right. I will come with you to Ulcaster and pray that Imoen will forgive my delay in her rescue.~
@60   = ~I will have no peace until I agree to follow you, this I can see. Lead on to Ulcaster, Imoen can fend for herself and my revenge on Irenicus will be all the sweeter for waiting.~
@61   = ~Then I beseech you once again, <CHARNAME>, do not take too long in coming to your decision, time will not always be on our side.~ [HROT_63]
@62   = ~I am relieved to hear this from you, <CHARNAME>, I did not relish the thought of embarking on this search alone. I appreciate you having enough trust in me to delay your search. Do not worry for Imoen, both she and Irenicus will be found, you have the word of Hrothgar on this.~ [HROT_62A]
@63   = ~You have slept on all that I have been able to tell you, <CHARNAME>, have you decided on what it is that you will do?~ [HROT_64]
@64   = ~Give me time man. Sleeping was the only thing on my mind last night! Give me chance to sort my head out will you!~
@65   = ~No, Hrothgar, it is not enough time for me to get my head around all that has happened. My head is spinning trying to make sense of it all. Give me another day or two.~
@66   = ~I have, Hrothgar, and although you have not been forthcoming with your answers and every fibre in my being is crying out for me not to abandon Imoen, you have not proven to be untrustworthy so far. I pride myself on being a fair judge of men and I see no malice in you, only the desire to do that which you believe to be right. I will come with you to Ulcaster and pray that Imoen will forgive my delay in her rescue. Perhaps you will speak more freely as we travel.~
@67   = ~I have, Hrothgar, you have been evasive with your answers but I feel somehow that what you are doing is right. I will go to Ulcaster with you and trust that all will turn out as you have said.~
@68   = ~Time is running out, <CHARNAME>, I cannot say how much longer I can wait for you to make up your mind. Please decide soon.~ [HROT_65]
@69   = ~I am relieved to hear this from you, <CHARNAME>, I did not relish the thought of embarking on this search alone. I appreciate you having enough trust in me to delay your search.~ [HROT_66A]
@70   = ~Do not worry for Imoen, both she and Irenicus will be found, you have the word of Hrothgar on this.~ [HROT_66B]
@71   = ~(*Anxiously*) It is time, <CHARNAME>, I leave this day with or without you. I would prefer it to be with you but there is no more time for delay. I leave no matter what your decision is. Which is it to be?~ [HROT_67]
@72   = ~I have had time to consider and to watch you, Hrothgar, and although you have not been forthcoming with your answers and every fibre in my being is crying out for me not to abandon Imoen, you have not proven to be untrustworthy so far. I pride myself on being a fair judge of men and I see no malice in you, only the desire to do that which you believe to be right. I will come with you to Ulcaster and pray that Imoen will forgive my delay in her rescue. Let us find these keys of yours.~
@73   = ~I cannot abandon Imoen to her fate, Hrothgar, you have told me no more than you did on our arrival in this city. It is not enough, I wish you every success in whatever it is that you are doing.~
@74   = ~My decision is to search for Irenicus as planned. I cannot be bothered with this foolish search of yours for keys, so if you are going to leave and time is that short, you would be best making a move now, Hrothgar.~
@75   = ~I thank you, <CHARNAME>. I always had faith that you would do what is right in the end. And please do not worry so much my friend, neither Imoen nor Irenicus will be going anywhere.~ [HROT_69]
@76   = ~(*Shakes his head and his voice takes on a tone of disappointment.*) Then it is alone. I fear my search will take me far and your destiny takes you in another direction.~ [HROT_68A]
@77   = ~I admit that I am dismayed by your decision, <CHARNAME>, I had hoped that when I left, it would be with you at my side.~ [HROT_68B]
@78   = ~I am sorry that I cannot impress on you the importance of this quest that I must undertake, but if you truly cannot find it in your heart to trust in my words, then we shall not meet again, <CHARNAME>. Be sure that this is your final answer before I leave.~ [HROT_68C]
@79   = ~You really believe that my aid is essential to the success of your quest Hrothgar, I can hear the disappointment in your voice as you speak. If this thing that you do is as important as you say it is, then perhaps I should travel with you, at least as far as Ulcaster and see what all this key business is about. Irenicus will wait, I pray that Imoen will not suffer unnecessarily whilst we are on this quest of yours. If time is so short then we should leave now.~
@80   = ~You are persistent! Lead on to Ulcaster, Imoen can fend for herself and my revenge on Irenicus will be all the sweeter for waiting.~
@81   = ~We really do not have the time to get involved in this affair. Our priorities do and must lie elsewhere.~ [HROT_72]
@82   = ~We have stirred up enough of a hornets nest as it is in this city. I think it would be wiser and safer if we continued on our way as quickly as possible.~ [HROT_73]
@83   = ~There is a reward for the return of this Leina, and I am not about to give it up just yet.~
@84   = ~I think I have shown the folk of this city that I am not one to be messed with. We have time to search a bit further for this girl.~
@85   = ~I will not leave this Leina to some unknown fate, Hrothgar. I know how it feels to be held helpless and afraid and I cannot just walk away if it is my power to help.~
@86   = ~I am not bothered about the people of this city, Hrothgar, but there is sense in your words. We can do no more here, let us get back to our own business.~
@87   = ~If you insist <CHARNAME>. Let us speak to the barkeep again, maybe he can tell us where this Govan Duvaine can be found, but let us make haste in clearing this matter up.~ [HROT_74]
@88   = ~Then let’s get this over with. I’m tired of wandering in this city.~ [HROT_75]
@89   = ~You shouldn’t drop the letter, <CHARNAME>. You may want to show it to the barkeep and to speak to him again. Maybe he can tell you where this Govan Duvaine can be found. But we really do not have the time to get involved in this affair. Our priorities do and must lie elsewhere.~
@90   = ~<CHARNAME>, we have no clues as where to search next. I am sorry my friend, we can’t do more for this Leina. If she is with her father then I am sure she is safe enough. Even if he has her confined, I doubt he will do her any harm.~ [HROT_76]
@91   = ~It would appear you are right Hrothgar. This Leina will have to take her chances with whatever fate has planned for her. Come my friends let us leave here.~
@92   = ~All this running around, I would put any amount of gold on it that Duvaine sent us halfway across the city to get us off his back. Come we are finished here but I am not done with him.~
@93   = ~Let us about our own business, we have done all we can here.~ [HROT_77]
@94   = ~There is an aura of great malevolence emanating from this creature, <CHARNAME>. Anything she has to offer is sure to be tainted by evil.~ [HROT_78]
@95   = ~I had hoped that you would heed my words, <CHARNAME>. I fear that through this bargain that you have made, we have all been touched by something bordering purest evil this night. The choice was yours and now we must all live with any consequences resulting from it.~ [HROT_79]
@96   = ~I am relieved, <CHARNAME>, the aura of evil that I sensed from that creature turned my blood to ice, as did every word that she spoke. Let us away from here.~ [HROT_80]
@97   = ~Well met to you, Tilorn. Whereas it is good to see you also... (*his voice takes on a tone of concern*)... pray tell me what has occurred that causes you to seek us out here?~ [HROT_81]
@98   = ~Of course. <CHARNAME>, come meet Tilorn, a friend.~ [HROT_82]
@99   = ~Patience, <CHARNAME>, Tilorn will tell us why he is here in his own time. Will you not, Tilorn?~ [HROT_83]
@100  = ~Tilorn, my friend, to change the past can have untold repercussions! Have we not been warned of the dangers of attempting such a thing!~ [HROT_84]
@101  = ~We have wasted enough time, we must make for Ulcaster immediately.~ [HROT_62B]
@102  = ~Tilorn is right, <CHARNAME>. If there is any truth in what he says, and I have no reason to doubt his words, then I must leave with him. I cannot keep pressing you to aid me if it is not in your heart to believe in me. I wish you luck in your search for your future, fare thee well, <CHARNAME>.~ [HROT_86]
@103  = ~If the mages accomplish this truth reading, <CHARNAME>, our mission and our lives will be lost.~ [HROT_87]
@104  = ~We must be on our guard here, <CHARNAME>. If any of the mages here even begin to suspect our purpose, the consequences for us would be dire indeed.~ [HROT_88]
@105  = ~Was that wise, <CHARNAME>, giving him your name?~
@106  = ~I think it is wise to be as friendly as possible when we talk to anyone here, Hrothgar, any rudeness may draw undue attention to ourselves. Besides no one in this time knows of us.~
@107  = ~Matej knows nothing of what is happening here, we were not in any danger from him.~
@108  = ~We need to learn as much as we can about Halruaa, Hrothgar. Stumbling blindly into places by accident will not help us to remain inconspicuous. There is no fear of any one having heard of me here.~
@109  = ~As much as it galls me to be polite to these people, it is necessary for now.~
@110  = ~You could be right, <CHARNAME>. However, I was more concerned to learn that Halruaa’s mages seem to be readying themselves to move against Ulcaster even as we stand here I had hoped that we would have more time.~
@111  = ~We have no proof that they are making their way to Ulcaster yet, Hrothgar. Matej only said that he thought they had left. He did not say that he had seen them leave.~
@112  = ~Let us not assume anything just yet, Hrothgar, we will continue our search and maybe get a clearer idea of how much time we do have.~
@113  = ~At least Matej has given us an insight to Halruaa and this appears to be where most of its activities take place. We should begin our investigation here and not make any assumptions just yet Hrothgar.~
@114  = ~I was merely expressing a wish for more time as we appear to have arrived slightly later than Tilorn had anticipated that we would. Now which way from here do you think?~
@115  = ~You should not have agreed to do this, <CHARNAME>, we have more important issues to address. Lavallin could not remember what items had been taken, for all we know he could just as easily misplaced them. We will have wasted time that could have been used in our own search.~ [HROT_93]
@116  = ~Lavallin has not locked the door, Hrothgar. We can always leave if nothing occurs soon.~
@117  = ~Relax, Hrothgar. I cannot see this taking too long. We only have to wait, confront whoever appears and get them to return Lavallin’s property which then becomes our property.~
@118  = ~Let us just wait and see if anyone appears, Hrothgar. I am intrigued as to how they get into a room that is wizard locked and warded, not that it is at this moment.~
@119  = ~If you must, <CHARNAME>, but I will not pretend to be happy about this delay... (*Hrothgar suddenly stops speaking and looks around. Seeing the disconcerted expression in his eyes, you also turn your head and peer into the empty space that seems to be holding his attention*)...~ [HROT_94]
@120  = ~Think carefully on what you agree to do here, <CHARNAME>. We do not know this Delrysia, nor have we heard her story.~ [HROT_95]
@121  = ~I believe you have been mistaken for another and you are supposed to have an answer for this man, sort of like a password?~ [HROT_96]
@122  = ~You were lucky this time, <CHARNAME>! Xan was too absorbed in his own thoughts to make too much of your slip at mentioning Nashkel. We should be more circumspect, another slip may not go unnoticed.~
@123  = ~Seeing Xan here took me by surprise, Hrothgar. Given the elven lifespan I can see how it is possible and of course Halruaa would be the obvious place for his early tutoring, but nonetheless it was still a shock seeing him stood there. I will be more careful from now on.~
@124  = ~I am sorry that my exuberance at seeing Xan again got the better of me Hrothgar. I forgot for a second that we are in the past and our meeting had not yet taken place for him. I will exercise more control from now on.~
@125  = ~I was suprised that was all Hrothgar. The last time I saw Xan he was dead, but I forgot that was the future Xan. I will not make such a mistake again.~
@126  = ~I am glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. We are in a hostile environment and we can ill afford to be discovered. Let us see this incident as a lesson to to be cautious in any future dealings with Halruaa’s mages. Let us continue this search.~
@127  = ~(*Nudging you with his elbow and whispering softly*)... <CHARNAME>, do not forget, this is a different time, what ever connection you had to Xan has not yet happened. See the way he eyes you suspiciously now!~
@128  = ~(*Speaking quietly*) Oooops! Sorry Hrothgar. It came as a shock to see him standing there that was all.~
@129  = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>, this mage speaks with authority in his voice.~
@130  = ~It would appear that there is something being plotted here, <CHARNAME>.~
@131  = ~Caius has confirmed that there has been a lot of meetings taking place recently, and he seemed to be in a hurry to cover his words when he realised what he had said. That and Matej thinking that some of Halruaa’s more prominent mages are away, does this not sound suspicious to you, <CHARNAME>?~
@132  = ~What ever is happening here, Hrothgar, we still do not know that it has anything to do with Ulcaster.~
@133  = ~I agree, Hrothgar, Caius did his best to make us think that these meetings that are taking place are common to Halruaa once he realised that he should not have mentioned them at all.~
@134  = ~Caius was still expecting guests, Hrothgar, so I think it is safe to assume that not all the preparations are complete. That gives us hope that we are in time to stop things.~
@135  = ~We can pretty much assume that it has something to do with Ulcaster. We know how Ulcaster was destroyed and we know that something is afoot here. Tilorn’s belief that Halruaa was at the heart of the conspiracy is looking to be correct. We have made a good start, <CHARNAME>.~
@136  = ~Then let us find and see what more we can learn from this Ray Von.~
@137  = ~We should tread more carefully, <CHARNAME>, I did not like the way Caius looked when he dismissed us. He is suspicious I am certain of it. We have made a good start but we must be more vigilant.~
@138  = ~This does not bode well, <CHARNAME>! We now know that the most of Halruaa’s senior mages have left and that they have the backing of specialist mages across The Realms.~
@139  = ~It is almost certain that all the planning took place here, why else would Halruaa play host to so many visiting mages in secret? The time is nigh and we are no closer to our goal, nor have we discovered any indication of the whereabouts of the second key.~
@140  = ~Then we will continue our search until we do discover something more, Hrothgar.~
@141  = ~As long as we are here, Hrothgar, and the assault has not begun, there is a chance to discover something yet.~
@142  = ~Then maybe we should spend more time searching and less time worrying that we are too late.~
@143  = ~We are not beaten yet, Hrothgar. We will continue the search and perhaps we can at least pass on to Tilorn what we know to be true, and he can make use of the information at some other time.~
@144  = ~Of course our search must continue and it is imperative that we do so without further delay.~
@145  = ~I wish it were as simple as that, <CHARNAME>. Tilorn believes that this will be the last chance to put this situation right. If we fail, he will have no choice other than to accept that things were meant to be as they stand, but as you say, we are not beaten yet, let us carry on without further delay.~
@146  = ~Are we discovered, <CHARNAME>? I said that I did not like the way Caius tried to cover his words.~
@147  = ~I am not sure, Hrothgar, it is possible.~
@148  = ~Their words were a bit vague, Hrothgar, they could relate to any thing. We will continue but we will be more careful with whom we speak to.~
@149  = ~If it is so, then stealth and speed are essential from now on.~
@150  = ~Perhaps we should look for the opportunity to silence Caius permanently!~
@151  = ~Then let us assume that our presence here is known, <CHARNAME>, and act accordingly from now on.~
@152  = ~No, <CHARNAME>! That would not be wise. Caius appears to be of importance here, if they do not suspect our presence yet, they most certainly will if he should suddenly disappear. No, we continue but with greater care.~
@153  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, we now know for sure that it was from Halruaa that the destruction of Ulcaster was plotted. Is it too late, do you think, to prevent it? Have we failed as did Tilorn?~
@154  = ~I do not know, Hrothgar, but let us not lose heart just yet. You heard Ray Von say that things were not quite ready. Whilst there is time, no matter how short, we should use it wisely.~
@155  = ~It sounds to me as though we have very little time, Hrothgar. So I suggest we stop asking is it too late and carry on until we know that it is too late.~
@156  = ~It would appear that Tilorn was right, Hrothgar, Halruaa does hold the key to Ulcaster’s downfall. So far we have found nothing that can be done to prevent this from happening, but while we have some time on our side there is hope that we may discover something yet.~
@157  = ~You are not suggesting that we give up are you, Hrothgar?~
@158  = ~The more we discover the more I fear that time is running out for Ulcaster, but as you say, <CHARNAME>, as long as we have some time left there is hope. I feel that we would do well to avoid contact with this Ray Von. He appears to know more than anyone that we have met so far and that could make him dangerous. Now, we really must get back to our search in earnest.~
@159  = ~No I am not, <CHARNAME>, but I do feel that time has run out for Ulcaster. From what we have heard, Halruaa’s mages are almost ready to launch their assault. I say *almost* ready, which means we do possibly have a small amount of time on our side. I suggest we avoid contact with this Ray Von, he appears to know more than anyone that we have met so far and that could make him dangerous. Now, we really must get back to our search in earnest.~
@160  = ~What if the balance has been tipped deliberately in one direction, Jaheira? Is it not right to intervene and try to correct it before it is tipped too far?~
@161  = ~You have no idea what Tilorn believes is at stake here. There is a far bigger picture than what you are seeing, Jaheira, bigger than you could even imagine.~
@162  = ~We do not have the time for explanations, Jaheira. If time is indeed running out for Ulcaster then we need to spend what time is left trying to find a means to prevent its downfall.~
@163  = ~We are discovered, <CHARNAME>. I fear we need to act quickly before the whole academy is alerted to our presence.~ [HROT_97]
@164  = ~I think he wan...~
@165  = ~Imoen, that *junk* you refer to, has taken me many adventuring years to collect. Each piece has a story of its own to tell.~
@166  = ~I get what you mean but its not so much that my *junk* tells me stories, more that whenever I look at a piece it reminds me of the place and the way it came into my possession.~
@167  = ~I have no idea Imoen but I am sure you are about to tell me!~
@168  = ~(*Laughs*)... Imoen, where ever do you get your ideas from? I need no reminders of my youth, those years were fraught with all the problems that being young bring. I was indeed glad to leave it behind me and take on the wisdom of age, not that I consider myself old by any means and I will thank you young woman to afford me the same consideration.~
@169  = ~Ah, so this is what this is about is it Imoen? You are hoping to hear a tale of some tragic love affair and that I now choose to live alone because my heart was broken by a past love. How well I remember the preoccupation of the young with love.~
@170  = ~I always thought I would marry one day but my travels left little time for the pursuit of romance and when I did finally decide it was time to stop my wandering I found myself in Easthaven.~
@171  = ~Here I have earned the respect of its people and have many friends, friends that I have sworn to protect come what may. I no longer feel the cravings of youth, for what you call romance...~
@172  = ~...and that my dear Imoen, is all you are going to hear. No broken heart, no tragedy, in fact, I am content with the way my life has turned out and I have no regrets whatsoever.~
@173  = ~(*Rolls his eyes*) And may the gods protect me from the exuberance of youth on this expedition!~
@174  = ~That is odd? The pass is often blocked by heavy snow falls but never this early in the season and avalanches are even rarer, there is seldom enough snow.~ [mute]
@175  = ~This is an ill omen.~
@176  = ~We can do no more for the dead, we must worry for ourselves now. It is imperative that we speak to Arundel about what has occurred here, and soon... but hold, we are in luck, there is a stranger ahead, maybe he can tell us more.~
@177  = ~Do not fret good smithy, we will find your son and all the other missing townsfolk. They will be returned and the perpetrators will pay dearly for their transgressions against this town, you have the word of Hrothgar on this.~
@178  = ~So, we are to do this creature’s bidding?~
@179  = ~I don’t see any other means of completing our mission.~
@180  = ~Why am I not surprised that the price for the success of this mission is the death of another?~
@181  = ~If this priestess is all that stands between the survival of Kuldahar, then her life is already forfeit.~
@182  = ~I do not envy you your role <CHARNAME>, decisions that concern who lives and who dies should be left to the gods. Let’s hope they understand that sometimes a mortal has no choice other than to take up the mantle.~
@183  = ~When giants are afraid then it is a sign for us to proceed with great care my friend.~
@184  = ~You could be right Hrothgar but then it may just be superstition that has scared them.~
@185  = ~We are all afraid of something and what frightens this giant may not necessarily be our own ideas of terror, but I agree we proceed with care.~
@186  = ~Well whatever it is, it has us to face now, not giants scared of their own shadows.~
@187  = ~As often as not superstition has its roots in fact, so let us not dismiss it so lightly.~
@188  = ~Then I guess we should set about dealing with whatever *it* may be and retrieving the hearstone gem.~
@189  = ~Then let us grab this heartstone gem as quickly and as quietly as we can.~
@190  = ~Well, if your friend Arundel is right we have no choice but to go in and retrieve the heartstone gem regardless of what might be guarding it.~
@191  = ~We need the heartstone gem so I guess its onward and upward, or should that be upward and onward? No matter forward will do!~
@192  = ~Giants do not scare easily, size alone makes them formidable foes for any creature so what ever has these on the run will not be frightened easily.~
@193  = ~Arundel seemed sure the gem was here, for Kuldahar’s sake I pray he is right and we can return it to him swiftly.~
@194  = ~I fear we are being played for fools here <CHARNAME>.~
@195  = ~How so Hrothgar?~
@196  = ~All I know is that I am getting tired of being sent on fools errands by Arundel. The gem had better be here Hrothgar.~
@197  = ~Relax Hrothgar, you are imagining things. Once we retrieve the gem we can deal with this evil once and for all.~
@198  = ~<CHARNAME>, you heard that cleric he said they weren’t going to be taken in by the same story twice.~
@199  = ~It looks like we’ve gone and stepped in it again.~
@200  = ~It’s too late to turn back now.~
@201  = ~Know any good jokes. I could use a good laugh about now.~
@202  = ~You misjudge Arundel my friend, I have known him a long time and I am sure he is as much in the dark as we are.~
@203  = ~That’s hardly comforting my friend.~
@204  = ~Just once, I’d like to have the advantage. Is that too much to ask?~
@205  = ~At this point, I don’t suppose it matters what we think of Arundel. Our die has been cast.~
@206  = ~That may be <CHARNAME>, but I feel that we must be prepared to face an enemy that knows our moves before we make them.~
@207  = ~The gem was here. It is as I feared, whoever took it is one step ahead of us, knows our movements and even of us. How this is possible when no other than Arundel knew of our intentions to come here is worrying. We must return to Kuldahar and speak with him quickly.~
@208  = ~As you say Hrothgar, we should leave for Kuldahar with all haste. I have some questions of my own to put to this druid friend of yours.~
@209  = ~I do not like what you imply here Jaheira. I have known Arundel for many years and trust his judgement implicitly. He would not put our lives in danger by sending us on a wild goose chase.~
@210  = ~As you well see the gem was here and we have probably missed the thieves by no more than a day.~
@211  = ~I will not have you casting aspersions on the integrity of such an old and dear friend of mine!~
@212  = ~(*Smiles*) What strange terminology you use Imoen. *Playing with a full set?!* I can assure you Imoen, Arundel has never played with anything less than *a full set* and his mind is as astute as any of ours here.~
@213  = ~Many stories have grown around this mount, what truth there is in them I do not know but they are enough that men give it a wide berth when passing this way. if the evil that threatens Kuldahar needs a place to work unmolested it would find such a place in the bowels of this mount. We must steel ourselves for what we may find inside.~
@214  = ~Erevain was a good and brave elf, may he find peace in his final rest.~
@215  = ~However did he come to be here? He didn’t leave with us and I am certain the avalanche has prevented anyone leaving Easthaven since our departure.~
@216  = ~A waste of a life... we could have maybe used his skills if we had known he was intent on leaving Easthaven.~
@217  = ~What did the poor fool hope to accomplish out here alone?~
@218  = ~Who knows? He may have left during the night, before we set out, after all, he knew these hills well.~
@219  = ~(*Reading Erevain’s journal*)... Well, that was interesting. Are all Evereskan elves so pessimistic I wonder. I ran into his cousin Xan down near Nashkel. A depressing sort of a fellow... there were times I wondered why he even bothered to wake up in the morning.~
@220  = ~(*Reading Erevain’s journal*)... I wonder, do all Evereskan elven folk feel the same way about the world?~
@221  = ~(*Reading Erevain’s journal*)... Tell me Jaheira, do your people have a different outlook on the world than this Evereskan?~
@222  = ~A waste of a life indeed and how many more will be lost before we lay this evil to rest?~
@223  = ~Erevain was no fool, but it appears that he has done a foolish thing. Does his journal provide any insights into what he was looking for here?~
@224  = ~I don’t know about all as I have not met many Everskan elves on my journeys, but Erevain did seem to be the pessimistic type.~
@225  = ~As loathe as I am to leave him here, we have no time to perform a burial. It will be for the creatures of this place to dispose of his body. May his god look benevolently upon his sacrifice.~
@226  = ~We can do no more for the fool. Let us continue before we share his fate, the creatures here are as much our enemy as the evil we seek.~
@227  = ~This battle is over. The Lizardman King has fallen.~
@228  = ~Agreed, but we must proceed with caution. Remember, the enemy knows we are coming.~
@229  = ~The villagers are important, but our main concern should be to track down the villain responsible for these atrocities... and with all speed.~
@230  = ~It’s true Dar, that head wound of Minsc’s is old. Anything that could have been done for him needed to be done months ago. The best that can be done now is friendship and understanding. Minsc has a good heart.~
@231  = ~Mother Egenia, what are you doing here?~
@232  = ~Mother Egenia, we have cleared the upper reaches of Dragon’s Eye. Can you tell us of anything of what lies ahead?~
@233  = ~Thank you Mother Egenia. That should help our planning.~
@234  = ~Yes thank you Mother Egenia. Let’s take this one step at a time. All spells memorised and everybody as rested as possible?~
@235  = ~One good thing about our opponent sitting back and waiting for us, we have time to regain our strength and plan between each major battle.~
@236  = ~That means at least two more sets of caverns lie ahead. I am betting that there could be more.~
@237  = ~I’m not sure Minsc. Something isn’t what it seems.~
@238  = ~I don’t think she’s too worried about it Minsc.~
@239  = ~When the time comes, I don’t think that will be a problem.~
@240  = ~That Imoen, was a very powerful and very ancient demon from the abyss itself. It is called a Marilith, one of the True Tanar’ri! I never thought to see such a creature on this plane... let alone have to do battle with the thing!~
@241  = ~She never did tell us what she planned on doing with the Heartstone Gem.~
@242  = ~If she was one measure of this little problem, the "Ancient Enemy" must be just as old and just as powerful.~
@243  = ~Yea gods, what are we letting ourselves in for this time?~
@244  = ~I know of no way to use the Gem ourselves. If we are to finish this once and for all we must return it to Arundel without delay.~
@245  = ~We have played this game well, now we must be very careful not to hand our victory to this newly revealed enemy. I fear our task is far from over, it is my belief that enemy is still at our door. Let us make haste and take the gem to Arundel... we must see where next our path lies.~
@246  = ~Although our work is done here, I fear we still have a long and perilous road ahead of us, we have won but half the battle today.~
@247  = ~I know this portal must look tempting to you... to all of you and I can well imagine the thoughts that are racing through your heads at this very moment. You are not sure where the portal will take you but you have hope that it may return you to your own time, to your own homes.~
@248  = ~I ask one thing of you all, please spare a moment and reflect on the words of Arundel and the promise you made to take the heartstone gem to Larrel at the Severed hand.~
@249  = ~Arundel struggled against the pain of his injuries to remain alive so’s he could tell us what he knew in the hope that we would continue our mission to save Kuldahar and maybe even Easthaven. Are we going to let all he suffered be for nothing?~
@250  = ~(*Putting his hand on her shoulder*) Imoen... you have the word of Hrothgar, you will go home, soon. Believe me when I say your future is not here and a couple of more days either here or there, will not make a difference to what is to come. Please, trust me?~
@251  = ~Please Jaheira, I am not without compassion. I see how your heart aches to find your Khalid and I see also the anguish in your eyes whenever you think of him, but please, trust me when I say that our travelling to the Severed Hand will not affect yours or Khalid’s future.~
@252  = ~I apologise for my choice of words Jaheira, I did not mean to cause you even more distress. All I am asking is that you trust me and help me do right by a dying man’s last request.~
@253  = ~If Boo will permit me Minsc, I can answer that for you?~
@254  = ~Then let me assure you my friend that you will, in time, avenge Dynaheir as is your sworn oath.~
@255  = ~Your sword is more than big enough to meet and deal with the many great evils that will come your way in the future, but firstly it is needed to aid me in ending the evil that threatens my time.~
@256  = ~I am sure Dynaheir would not want you to leave evil free to roam, no matter where it is to be found.~
@257  = ~So my friend, I believe our next step together as a group and maybe the fate of Kuldahar lies in your hands.~
@258  = ~I hear your words Hrothgar and I know Arundel was your friend. I also understand that you should want to do right by him, but I have friends of my own here, and I must do what I think is right by them.~
@259  = ~If this portal takes us back to the future, my time as you put it, then these events will have occurred and passed. I see no sense in us remaining here to repeat them.~
@260  = ~If we travel to this Severed Hand with you Hrothgar, then we all risk losing this portal and possibly our only chance to return home. That is some risk you are asking us to take when we don’t even know how to reach this place.~
@261  = ~The problems of this time are not mine Hrothgar, in my time they have already been played out in the past. However the future, my future holds many questions of my own that I need to find answers to. I am sorry, but I am taking the portal.~
@262  = ~You can’t even be sure that this portal will lead you home <CHARNAME>. As for your friends, they will follow where ever you lead, that I am sure. I have seen how they look to you for leadership and guidance since your arrival in what must seem like an alien land to you.~
@263  = ~You can not possibly know what has now occurred and passed in your time, none of us can... not now.~
@264  = ~I can understand your concern and if our situations were reversed, I would be wanting to leap through the portal in the hope that it takes me home, but you must understand that I am trying to protect my town and the lives of the innocent people who live there.~
@265  = ~You will have your answers in time, but you will have to trust me for I can say no more at this time.~
@266  = ~If you tell them that you believe the Severed Hand is where you must next travel, they will put away their fears and not question your decision.~
@267  = ~Please trust me when I say, that if you lose this portal, another will be found and you will see your time again, travelling to the Severed Hand will in no way effect your future, where as not travelling there could well effect the lives of those who, are at present, living in your future time.~
@268  = ~I recall you asking me about portals Hrothgar and now you assure me that another will be found if this one is lost to us... why do I feel that you are keeping something from me?~
@269  = ~How can not travelling to the Severed hand possibly effect what has already come and gone?~
@270  = ~My friends’ futures belong in another time Hrothgar. It is not for me to tell them that they must forego perhaps their last chance to return there.~
@271  = ~Your being here could have very easily set these events in motion again and if that is so then we must see them through in order to keep the future, yours and all those living there now, constant. Surely you can see the sense in my words?~
@272  = ~You seem awfully concerned about my future. I find myself asking why as it can not effect your life here in the past?~
@273  = ~I can see some truth in what you are saying but if I agree to go with you, we still have the problem of how do find our way to the Severed Hand from here?~
@274  = ~My life hasn’t actually been a bed of roses since leaving Candlekeep, the possibility of change might just appeal to me.~
@275  = ~I do not have to live in a time to worry about its people. The future has troubles enough of its own and if your being here only adds to them, then we must do all that is possible to disturb the balance between past and future as little as possible.~
@276  = ~I believe your travelling to the Severed Hand with me will help us to preserve the events of the past and safeguard the future as you know it.~
@277  = ~What would you know of the troubles of the future Hrothgar? Odd words don’t you think from a man of the past?~
@278  = ~You presume to know a lot of what must be done to preserve the future Hrothgar, do you care to share with me how you come by such knowledge?~
@279  = ~We started this mission to save Kuldahar and now you speak of preserving the future, what is really going on here?~
@280  = ~What do you know of my life that prompts you to say that it must be allowed to play out? How can you, a man of the past, know of my life in the future? Come, I will have answers before I take another step further with you?~
@281  = ~Not so odd when you consider that all eras have troubles of sorts and your being here could have untold repercussions on any event that transpires from this date.~
@282  = ~The minute you stepped into Easthaven, my mission became your future and we should therefore tread carefully and keep events in the order they occurred. Please, trust me when I say I know what I am talking about and how we must proceed.~
@283  = ~You say your mission is tied to my future and ask me to trust you, then you refuse to say anything more... who are you Hrothgar?~
@284  = ~You ask me to give up maybe my only hope of getting home merely by saying *trust me*? I’ll need a better reason than that if I am to aid you further.~
@285  = ~I give my trust only to those who have earned it Hrothgar and your reluctance to talk honestly with me is not doing anything to earn you that privilege. Either you tell me the truth or my friends and myself are taking this portal.~
@286  = ~If you want my aid and my trust, then I suggest you do me the same courtesy and tell me the truth of this mission of yours.~
@287  = ~There is no more that I can tell you at this present time.~
@288  = ~When the need arises you have my word that I will answer all of your questions, but until then I beseech you to please bear with my necessary silence for a while longer, trust me and know that my only concern is for the future... yours and that which is yet to come.~
@289  = ~You give me only cryptic answers, tell me that you can say no more and then expect me to trust you... to follow you? I am sorry Hrothgar but if you can not trust me with the truth then I can no longer aid you and this is where our paths divide.~
@290  = ~I would be a fool to continue with one who refuses to speak and who conceals his true intent. I see this portal as a safer option than travelling with a man who keeps much hidden and therefore it is my chosen path.~
@291  = ~Intuition tells me to trust you Hrothgar, but my need to return home is telling me to take this portal. Can you not give me some word that will allay my friends fears, to let them know that another way home will be found?~
@292  = ~If I agree to aid you, will you then trust me with more of what you know Hrothgar?~
@293  = ~If I agree to aid you further Hrothgar, how are we to find our way to Larrel and the Severed Hand?~
@294  = ~I am sorry, as I have said I can tell you no more. I do understand your apprehension and given your previous experiences I can also understand your reluctance to trust me.~
@295  = ~You speak of Hrothgar of Easthaven, a legend in your time, if what you know of me from those stories and what you have learnt through our time together has not convinced you that I am a man you can trust then nothing more I can say will.~

@297  = ~Please, for the sake of all the people here, trust me and bear with me a while longer, for I can say no more at this time.~
@298  = ~Trust me also when I say that travelling to the Severed Hand will in no way hinder your path to those answers.~
@299  = ~I must go to the Severed Hand, alone if necessary but I would prefer that you travel just this one step further with me. Please, won’t you give some consideration to my request?~
@300  = ~Be assured, I know of a way to deliver us safely to the Severed Hand. All you have to say is that you agree to help me and we can be on our way without further delay, but please I must press you for your answer now... the more we delay the more our enemy gains the advantage over us.~
@301  = ~Then lead us to this safe path of yours Hrothgar and let us set about changing the odds a little more to our advantage.~
@302  = ~Then lead the way, but know that if this should turn out to be a ploy to keep me away from Irenicus, then you will regret the day you sided with that madman.~
@303  = ~I am relieved to see that my faith in you has not been misplaced, thank you for trusting me.~
@304  = ~I thank all of you, I know not whether it is because you follow <CHARNAME> that you are aiding me or whether you trust and believe the word of Hrothgar, what ever your reasons, know that I speak only the truth and that you will find your path home. Ready yourselves for we travel to the Severed Hand.~
@305  = ~Whatever does or does not occur here will in no way affect a change to your life <CHARNAME>, that is set and must be allowed to play out. It is those that now live in what you know as the future that will feel the effects of these events, they are the ones that I fear for.~
@306  = ~I believe the way to safe guard the future and prevent further troubles is for us to continue to the Severed Hand, play the hand that has been dealt us, all of us. The past must be preserved for the sake of the future.~
@307  = ~I am saying nothing more than that which anyone with an ounce of common sense could see for themselves. It doesn’t take any special knowledge to know that any change in past events is sure to have repercussions on the future.~
@308  = ~The minute you stepped into Easthaven, my mission became your future. Please I can say no more except that we must preserve the past in order to preserve the future. I ask only that you trust me in this matter.~
@309  = ~The two became connected the minute you stepped through the portal and into Easthaven <CHARNAME>. I cannot explain how, all I can ask is that you trust me enough to continue on this mission a little further with me.~
@310  = ~This time is in need of you to aid me in protecting my people and the people of Kuldahar from this evil that has arisen.~
@311  = ~However, your path is not of this time <CHARNAME> and as such you have the word of Hrothgar that you will find your portal home. I can neither say nor promise you any more than that.~
@312  = ~If that is not enough for you to trust me and aid me further then there is no more to be said. I beseech you to come to the Severed Hand with me but the decision is yours... what do you say?~
@313  = ~(*Hrothgar seems to be preoccupied*) As promised w... we...~
@314  = ~Never mind the blasted squirrel, how the hell did you do that Hrothgar, and what was that small box you had there?~
@315  = ~Hrothgar, you had better explain how in the Nine Hells we just got here?~
@316  = ~What the... by the horns of the Tarrasque... what just happened here Hrothgar?~
@317  = ~No more secrets Hrothgar, no ordinary man could gave done what you just did! What manner of man are you?~
@318  = ~Yea gods! Who are you man?~
@319  = ~I am sorry, I did not mean to alarm you.~
@320  = ~I should have warned you before teleporting but I was anxious not to lose any more time and I had to be sure that we would all arrive safely. It will, I am sure, take all our resources to bring down this evil that we face.~
@321  = ~Our adversary has managed to keep one step ahead of our every move and I was concerned that we should reach Larrel before our path became blocked.~
@322  = ~You have no need to fear betrayal from me, I have given you my word on this but come, we should not be wasting time standing around here, we must enter the tower and look for Larrel as Arundel bid us do.~
@323  = ~Yes, a warning would have been nice, but more to the point, who are you and how is it that you can teleport at will?~
@324  = ~That doesn’t answer my question as to what manner of man are you Hrothgar?~
@325  = ~You display abilities deployed by magic users and yet it is clear you are no mage. Who, or dare I ask it, what are you?~
@326  = ~I want an explanation of what has just occurred here and I don’t want to hear any more vague answers! It’s time for YOU to show ME some trust.~
@327  = ~Who I am you... that you already know and anything else is irrelevant for the time being. Please, do not question me further, as I have said, I can not give you answers at this present time. What is important is the task we are here to do, I beseech you please, let us enter the tower to begin our search.~
@328  = ~You dance around my questions and answer with yet more vague answers. Do you really expect me to trust a man who takes great pains to hide the truth?~
@329  = ~At this moment the most important thing to me is my life and the lives of my friends. I have fought and defeated treachery before, I will not hesitate to do so again if this is the intent behind your cryptic answers.~
@330  = ~Do I Hrothgar? I thought I knew the man whom legend speaks so highly of, but is it not true that legend also glosses over that which it doesn’t want remembered? Is this the true reason for your evasiveness, is there more to the man than is told?~
@331  = ~I am sorry, I am not being vague without good reason. Those reasons will become known to you in time, for now all I ask is that you ask yourself, apart from my silence, and our sudden appearance here, have I given you any cause to mistrust me or to feel that I wish you harm <CHARNAME>?~
@332  = ~If your answer is no then please trust me and let us enter the tower together. We must begin our search without further delay.~
@333  = ~I am undecided Hrothgar, however I believe that I have no choice other than to follow you in the hope that you speak the truth. I can see no other way of us leaving this place safely.~
@334  = ~It is true, you have done nothing to cause me to mistrust you, but your silence is not comforting either. However, I will not risk the lives of my friends by walking away and looking for a road out of this place, so... I will aid you in return for safe passage when we are done.~
@335  = ~Your reluctance to speak worries me greatly Hrothgar, but as I have seen no sign of malice in either your actions or your words, I will continue as we are. Come let us enter the tower together and find our answers.~
@336  = ~I will aid you Hrothgar, but know that any sign of betrayal on your part and I will bury you among these ruins myself.~
@337  = ~I am sorry that you feel that I brought you here under deception. It is not my wish that you should feel compelled to aid me in exchange for the road home, but please know that I am grateful for your aid and that as soon as we have spoken with Larrel, we will all be leaving this place.~
@338  = ~The only thing I am looking to do harm to is the evil which threatens innocent townsfolk. I have no intentions of allowing any ill to befall you or your friends <CHARNAME>.~
@339  = ~Believe me <CHARNAME>, I am as concerned for your safety as you are yourself. I can see by your face that you doubt my words. Nevertheless, I am grateful for your aid and I hope that by the time we are through here you will have learnt to trust me at least a little. Come, we have much to do before this day ends.~
@340  = ~Once we have our answers, hopefully a way will be found for you to continue your journey in your own time. Come, no more talk we have much to do before this day ends.~
@341  = ~We must not allow our emotions and feelings of injustice force us to act rashly. Kaylessa has told us of how capable and dedicated her soldiers were in life, we must act on the assumption that they have lost none of their ardour in death. We would be wise to take our next steps very carefully until we know the nature of those we are to battle.~
@342  = ~Your concern for the souls of others does you proud Accalia but let us not allow our emotions and feelings of injustice force us to act rashly. Kaylessa has told us of how capable and dedicated her soldiers were in life, we must act on the assumption that they have lost none of their ardour in death. We would be wise to take our next steps very carefully until we know the nature of those we are to battle.~
@343  = ~There is great compassion in that which we are about to do for these tortured souls my friends. These were once proud soldiers and as such are undeserving of the cruel blow that fate has bestowed upon them. Know that there is no shame in bringing death, and in its wake, peace to those suffering such torment.~
@344  = ~You show great compassion in that which you are about to do here my friend. These unfortunate souls were once proud soldiers and as such are undeserving of the cruel blow that fate has bestowed upon them. Know that there is no shame in bringing death, and in its wake, peace to souls so cruelly tortured.~
@345  = ~I would have needed to be blind not to see the hope that sprang to your eyes when Kaylessa mentioned the purpose of Larrel’s astrolabe, and I saw the same look as you spoke to Geralith. All I am asking is that when you speak to Larrel, please remember the reason that I brought us here <CHARNAME>... to save Kuldahar and of your promise to help.~
@346  = ~I do not need reminding of our reason for being here Hrothgar, but you also have to understand that I have to explore any chance that comes along that may take me home.~
@347  = ~I am not about to dismiss another chance to go home Hrothgar, but you need not worry, I will speak to Larrel about the heartstone gem.~
@348  = ~My abrupt arrival here and your reluctance to speak truthfully has not endeared me to your quest Hrothgar. My only concern now is to find a way home.~
@349  = ~I have given you my word that you will find your way home. If Larrel’s astrolabe is capable of such a feat, then please, I ask only that you consider what he has to say when he looks into the heartstone gem before you make your decision.~
@350  = ~I will consider what Larrel has to say but I make no promise as to how I act on his words.~
@351  = ~We could be getting ahead of ourselves here. Let us just wait and see what this astrolabe is capable of and then we can start to think about decisions.~
@352  = ~I promise you, I will not make any hasty decisions until I have heard Larrel out.~
@353  = ~Then all that I ask is that you take time to consider your decision after he has spoken of the heartstone gem.~
@354  = ~If it was in my power to tell you more then I would... believe me, but I can not keep stressing that it is not! If you take my silence as a sign of betrayal or mistrust then I am sorry, for I do not have the words to change how you feel. Please, listen to whatever Larrel has to say when he looks into the heartstone gem before you abandon this mission.~
@355  = ~Whatever Hrothgar. I tire of hearing the same words or similar, so until you can tell me more, I am looking out for myself from this point on.~
@356  = ~If I decide to abandon this mission, it will be through your own stubborn reluctance not to be honest with me. You will have none but yourself to blame Hrothgar.~
@357  = ~Not exactly the answer I had hoped for <CHARNAME>, but I will accept it. Now, without further delay, let us speak with Larrel.~
@358  = ~A fair enough answer my friend. Now, without further delay, let us speak with Larrel.~
@359  = ~I am tied <CHARNAME>, I speak only the truth. If you have made up your mind then so be it. Let us speak with Larrel and hope that he has the words that we both want to hear.~
@360  = ~Perhaps with the knowledge that Larrel’s research has uncovered and with Geralith’s knowledge of his machine, it can be modified and used as a time travel machine.~
@361  = ~Hrothgar that is brilliant! What do you say Larrel?~
@362  = ~What do you say Larrel, can this be done?~
@363  = ~Your compulsion to do right by your friend is commendable Minsc, but please, you must contain your wrath for a while longer. When you confront this evil wizard then let him feel the force of your righteous fury, not your friends here.~
@364  = ~(*Quietly*) Patience Accalia. <CHARNAME> must be given the chance to decide without undue pressure from me.~
@365  = ~Nothing that I did not already suspect... ah Larrel and Geralith return, let us listen to what they have to say.~
@366  = ~I am disappointed to say the least <CHARNAME>. I had hoped that given the choice you would remember your promise to aid me in uncovering and defeating this evil that threatens my time and its people? You gave me hope that together we could best our enemy and bring a future to my people. Was I so wrong when I took you to be an honourable and stalwart ally.~
@367  = ~I am sorry Hrothgar, but no matter how many times you might say *if one portal closes another will open*, I can not believe that there will be that many portals.~
@368  = ~My friends and I have future elsewhere and the longer we stay here the less chance we have of finding it. I am sorry but the past is yours and the future is mine.~
@369  = ~I will not allow myself to be dissuaded again Hrothgar. I am going home and you can choose to come with me or stay, but decide quickly.~
@370  = ~You know that I will not leave this place, not while its peace is under threat from such evil. Will you not stand by your word and aid me in this task? You gave me hope that together we could best our enemy and bring a future to my people. Was I so wrong when I took you to be an honourable and stalwart ally.~
@371  = ~Then the responsibility for what ensues from your actions here will be yours to live with <CHARNAME>. Many will suffer as a result of you choosing to abandon them to the mercy of evil... well I will not leave them without hope.~
@372  = ~Make haste, the astrolabe will take you to your future.~
@373  = ~You have to understand that, no matter how futile the attempt, I will not give up on my people... my conscience would not allow me any other path.~
@374  = ~No, I don’t understand, in the future the outcome of this battle is decided. If you travel with me to the future there will be no need to put yourself through this hell.~
@375  = ~Think for a moment Hrothgar, would not travelling to the future mean your struggle here could end and because history will have already told of the events, then your conscience should not trouble you either?~
@376  = ~It’s up to you, stay here and fight unnecessarily or come with me to a future where your struggle is over and is a story of legend.~
@377  = ~Accalia please, your words sadden me more than <CHARNAME>’s refusal to aid me further. If it is not the will of the god’s that we have this group’s aid when we travel to Dorn’s Deep then we must accept that is the way it has to be.~
@378  = ~If only it were that simple, then yes I would consider travelling with you. However, the future can not tell of the past if the man has not yet performed the actions, or if the events are still to unfold.~
@379  = ~My coming to the future would cause more disruption than your coming to the past ever could <CHARNAME>. No, my place is here where I must allow these events to play out. There is no other way. Unless...~
@380  = ~Unless what?~
@381  = ~Hrothgar please, I am anxious to be gone, so if you have something to add, please be quick about it.~
@382  = ~I’ll not delay much longer, if you have something to say, then spit it out. If not then I am gone.~
@383  = ~I believe that these events of the past must be allowed to be played out. However, maybe... just maybe it doesn’t matter when they are concluded as long as they are. If this is so and I come with you to the future, can I rely on you to return to Dorn’s Deep with me and to finish that which we started here when it becomes necessary?~
@384  = ~Once I have dealt with Irenicus and found my answers, then yes, I will aid you again.~
@385  = ~You ask that I travel back to this time again at some future date? Your words give rise to yet more questions Hrothgar, but if you answer my questions and truthfully before the necessary time, then yes, I will aid you again.~
@386  = ~I make no promises, but I will consider your request when I know Hrothgar the man better. I can say no fairer.~
@387  = ~If you aid me in dealing with Irenicus, then yes, you have my aid in this task, but only after the wizard has been taken to task for the torment that he has visited upon me.~
@388  = ~Then it is decided, I will travel with you through the future and see what there is to see.~
@389  = ~What of you Dar?~
@390  = ~Accalia, you have not misjudged me. There are things that you do not know, things I can not speak of. You have trusted me so far and not asked questions, so please trust me when I say that I know what I am doing and that not one innocent person will suffer through my actions.~
@391  = ~If I am right then as long as I return at some time to see this through then all will be well, but in the meantime, I know that this part of my path lies in the future. There are things I must take care of, can you trust me in this Accalia, please?~
@392  = ~I have known you ever since you came to Easthaven, Accalia, and I know better than to try and dissuade you when your mind is set. I will pray that Tempus will watch over and keep safe the bravest of his servants.~ [HROT_47]
@393  = ~So <CHARNAME>, it is time to see what this future that you are so anxious to return to has to offer.~
@394  = ~Ah... if only life were as simple as the way you perceive it Imoen! It isn’t, it is hard and it forces duties upon us, that if we have a conscience, we can not deny. I am sure <CHARNAME> understands what it is I am saying and if you do not, then as you travel with <PRO_HIMHER>, so will you learn understanding. Is this not right <CHARNAME>?~
@395  = ~You of all people should know of the duty we have to fight for those too weak to stand for themselves my friend. I can see the wisdom in the words of Minsc but I also have a conscience that will not let me rest if I abandon my people. Yes, I am probably going to die but at least my spirit will rest in the knowledge that I tried. That I am sure you can all understand.~
@396  = ~You my friend, know of the duty we have to fight for those too weak to stand for themselves. Yes, I am probably going to die but I have a conscience that will not let me rest if I abandon my people. At least if I fall trying then my spirit will rest in the knowledge that I have tried. That I am sure you can all understand.~
@397  = ~If you think to return to Kuldahar and take the portal in Arundel’s house, I would strongly advise against it <CHARNAME>. Time has shifted since it opened and there can be no guarantee that this shift has not affected where the portal now exits. That is, presuming the portal is still open.~
@398  = ~Were we ever sure where the portal was going to take us Hrothgar?~
@399  = ~I fail to see how this shift in time makes the portal any less of a gamble then it did when first it opened?~
@400  = ~If there’s even the slightest chance that the portal is still open and Larrel can send me to Kuldahar then that is where I am going.~
@401  = ~I will not be swayed this time Hrothgar, nor am I about let this opportunity to return to the portal and home slip away.~
@402  = ~The portal was opened as a way to the future, or so you hoped, and if this was its purpose then it would have opened at the most fortuitous time to ensure that. Now however, time has shifted, days have passed and so has time for the portal.~
@403  = ~We do not know how time behaves in these portals, all we know is that it also shifts, what was the best possible time to enter the portal at Kuldahar has passed and with it the chance of a safe exit.~
@404  = ~So Hrothgar... you do know of portals after all!~
@405  = ~When did you suddenly acquire all this knowledge of portals?~
@406  = ~All this from a man who denied knowing of portals when asked. How much more of what you have said has been lies?~
@407  = ~You would be wasting your time. Even if the portal is still there, and I doubt it is for it is the nature of portals to shift as and when the time they are intended to exit or enter passes.~
@408  = ~As time here has passed so has time in the future and as such, time in the portal will have become disrupted, unstable... often causing the portal itself to break apart.~
@409  = ~I recall saying that I had heard of wizards using such devices and I myself wondered at the genius it took to make such portals <CHARNAME>. You forget, I have travelled far as an adventurer and learnt much. I am fortunate that my mind is such, that it retains all that it learns.~
@410  = ~Trust my words or not, but if you are determined to leave this place then it would be safer and a far less wastage of your time if you use the astrolabe.~
@411  = ~I suppose it does make sense to use the astrolabe to get me home... Larrel, I have some questions about the astrolabe and of the research that you were doing before the Hand fell.~
@412  = ~I can always get Larrel to send me to Kuldahar if the astrolabe proves useless... Larrel, may I ask you some questions about the astrolabe and of the research that you were doing before the Hand fell.~
@413  = ~No Hrothgar, my mind is set. I prefer to trust my luck with the portal in Kuldahar then a machine that was built for research.~
@414  = ~(*Quietly to himself*) If you are determined to leave <CHARNAME>, then it is for me to ensure that you do so safely.~
@415  = ~I am disappointed to say the least <CHARNAME>. I had hoped that given the choice you would remember your promise to aid me in uncovering and defeating this evil that threatens my time and its people?~
@416  = ~You gave me hope that together we could best our enemy and bring a future to my people. Was I so wrong when I took you to be an honourable and stalwart ally.~
@417  = ~Then the responsibility for what ensues from your actions here will be yours to live with <CHARNAME>.~
@418  = ~Many will suffer as a result of you choosing to abandon them to the whims of evil... well I will not leave them without hope.~
@419  = ~<CHARNAME>, you have to understand that, no matter how futile the attempt, I will not give up on my people... my conscience would not allow me any other path.~
@420  = ~So <CHARNAME>, let’s go to Kuldahar.~
@421  = ~We should make our way to Arundels’s house and hope that luck is on our side. Remember my warning though, if the portal is still open, we do not know where it may lead, but this was your choice <CHARNAME> and now we must see it through.~
@422  = ~A bit of confidence please Hrothgar, after all, I have had to make many choices and so far they have all come out right in the end.~
@423  = ~Then you will have to trust me for once when I say that this is the right decision.~
@424  = ~Stop fretting Hrothgar. Let us just go and see if the portal is still open.~
@425  = ~I heard your warning Hrothgar, now can we just get over to the druid’s house and see if I was right to return here?~
@426  = ~Well, we won’t see the wisdom in your decision by standing around here will we? Let us go over to Arundel’s house and see for ourselves how right you are this time... though, it will be strange not to have him greet me as I walk in.~
@427  = ~It will be strange walking into Arundel’s house and not have him greet me, he has over looked Kudahar for as long as I have known him. Still, all things change and we must learn to accept that which we can not control. Come let us see if your portal still stands <CHARNAME>.~
@428  = ~I am sorry Jaheira, nothing I say will ease the pain you are feeling at this moment. You need to take time to grieve for your Khalid and then there will be a time when need to talk about him. I did not know him but please know that I am here when that time comes.~
@429  = ~We will not be here for long my friend and with any luck we will not be having a lot of dealings with the wizards inside the academy.~
@430  = ~I am sorry my friend but if as you say the portal closed behind you, then I doubt that it was intended to be your way home. Be assured, I will help in your search for another way home, but for the moment I am more concerned for our safety. It is imperative that we speak to Arundel about what has occurred here, and soon... but hold, we are in luck, there is a stranger ahead, maybe he can tell us more.~
@431  = ~You seek to kill the innocent of the past in order to exact retribution on one in the future? If it’s vengeance you want my friend then you will have it soon enough, and there will be no need to shed the blood of those whose only crime is to be distant kin to this wizard you speak of. However, that is for a time yet to come, for now, I am concerned only with our immediate safety. It imperative that we speak to Arundel about what has occurred here, and soon... but hold, we are in luck, there is a stranger ahead, maybe he can tell us more.~
@432  = ~When we are done here, and the gods permit it, we should try and find his people... return his journal to them. That is all that we can do for him, at least that way any family he has will not be left wondering his fate.~
@433  = ~Elves seem to worry very little about anything, much less of what occurs in the world of men. Is it our short life span that gives rise to their lack of interest I wonder? This elf was at least prepared to try to help save this world and as such, once we are done here, we should perhaps find his people... tell them of his sacrifice.~
@434  = ~We have at least learnt who was responsible for the disappearance of so many people. I thank the gods that we were in time to save as many as we have and I pray for the gods to take into their keeping the souls of those for whom we came too late. If we had waited another day then... no,  I don’t even want to contemplate what we may have found within these caverns if we had not arrived when we did.~
@435  = ~Then our first task should be to seek out this Yxonmei and put her to rights.~
@436  = ~Then our next step should be to return to Kuldahar and see that all of the villagers have returned safely.~
@437  = ~We have little choice now, our only way out of this mess is to get to the bottom of it and deal with whatever evil we find there.~
@438  = ~As I said, we need to move with all speed now my friends.~
@439  = ~As with any situation Jaheira, we can but do our best to achieve the most desirable outcome for ourselves. If on the other hand the gods, or fate as some prefer to believe in, have other plans... then we can do nought but except that which transpires, knowing that we did the very best that we could.~
@440  = ~Minsc is much like yourself Dar, he has a good and courageous heart. You would find no better friend or ally in Minsc the ranger.~
@441  = ~Sound advice my friend, but if we are set then I suggest that we move on.~
@442  = ~I certainly wouldn’t bet against you. Hopefully our opponents will continue to allow us to prepare for them one at a time.~
@443  = ~A Marilith? I never expected to see such an abomination as one of the True Tanar’ri on this plane and I certainly never expected to face one in battle!~
@444  = ~It never did tell us what it planned on doing with the Heartstone Gem.~
@445  = ~If it was one measure of this little problem, then the “Ancient Enemy” must be just as old and just as powerful.~
@446  = ~(*Smiling*) I can see I am getting too old for this adventuring and monster slaying lark. I think I actually prefer some boredom in my life if it means I no longer have to face and do battle against that which we have met this day. However, I fear our task is far from over, it is my belief that the real enemy is still at our door. Let us take the gem to Arundel and see where next our path lies.~
@447  = ~One thing seems certain. We are being used as a weapon by one of these enemies, to destroy the other.~
@448  = ~For now, let’s just make sure that one of these enemies is unhappy with the outcome.~
@449  = ~Each foe we dispatch leaves us one step closer to solving this puzzle.~
@450  = ~Ah! Who cares? Lets just plant these vermin!~
@451  = ~Whoever this “Old Enemy” is, I think we can safely assume that they are not our ally!~
@452  = ~Very true, so I suggest we best get on with the task at hand.~
@453  = ~Agreed, but a little caution and planning can go a long ways towards helping us survive long enough to see the end of this.~
@454  = ~Patience my friend, I don’t believe this evil is in too much of a hurry to be leaving here. We will be upon it soon enough... then you will get the chance to show it how the righteous sword and the bootheels of Minsc deals with evil.~
@455  = ~So, <CHARNAME>, have you decided on what it is that you will do?~
@456  = ~The mage may no longer have need of his body <CHARNAME> but on his passing he entrusted it to the keeping of his fellow mages. To abuse that trust and to give it over to this necromancer is both evil and morally wrong!~
@457  = ~I too am relieved that you failed <CHARNAME>, you would do well to listen to your companions if you expect this group to continue to follow your lead. Their feelings and moral codes are important to them and as such should not be disregarded when making decisions that effect them. Now, I have said my piece, let us get back to the business at hand.~
@458  = ~I am relieved that you failed this time <CHARNAME>. I made my feelings perfectly clear before you accepted this task. Whereas we are not all bound by the same moral codes, you should take into consideration the feelings of the group as a whole when making decisions which effect us all, morally and spiritually. Now, I have said my piece, let us get back to the business at hand.~
@459  = ~Leveller? What kind of infernal artifact would be given the name *leveller*? I don’t even want to think what it might be capable of! This could be just the thing we are looking for <CHARNAME>, a device that could have tipped the balance in Halruaa’s favour.~
@460  = ~We have to take time out to find and destroy this thing, before it can be used against Ulcaster by this first wave.~
@461  = ~I am with you there Hrothagr, but first we have to find where this first wave of mages are hiding out.~
@462  = ~And where would you have us begin our search Hrothgar? This letter is not very forthcoming with information.~
@463  = ~I agree, putting this first wave of mages down would be striking a blow for Ulcaster, but where do we begin to find mages who do not want to be found?~
@464  = ~All we have is a name... Brial... she could be anywhere in the academy and with the size of this place, we may never find her in time to stop their departure.~
@465  = ~As much as I hate to admit it Hrothgar, but you are right, this artifact could be just the thing that Tilorn hoped we might find.~
@466  = ~Hrothgar, did my ears deceive me, or did I actually hear you say we must take time out from our mission?~
@467  = ~We have a name, Brial, so maybe finding and searching her quarters might be a good place to start. Also, a far quicker route than searching for the mage herself, who after all, is not very likely to tell us anything even if we do manage to track her down.~
@468  = ~Then what are we waiting for, let’s get searching.~
@469  = ~She might you know, if we threaten or torture her... but I can see by your face you don’t like that idea. So then Hrothgar, the plan is to seek and given the opportunity, ask!~
@470  = ~Good suggestion Hrothgar, and one I was about to come up with myself. Let’s get moving and find these errant mages.~
@471  = ~You took the words right out of my mouth Hrothgar. Let us find this Brial’s quarters and attempt to lessen the size of that wave that is due to crash onto Ulcaster’s shores.~
@472  = ~Then it would make more sense to find and search her quarters <CHARNAME>. Even if we did manage to track her down she’s hardly likely to tell us where her friends are hiding out now is she?~
@473  = ~I hope so <CHARNAME>. Our search has proven fruitless so far and I am beginning to despair of finding anything that will aid him in his fight to save Ulcaster.~
@474  = ~As for the second key... we have found no mention of it at all, I am beginning to suspect that Halruaa knows nothing of its existence.~
@475  = ~I can only suggest that we find and search this Brial’s quarters for further clues as to where these mages are hiding out.~
@476  = ~Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit <CHARNAME>, you will do well to remember that.~
@477  = ~At least it’s wit Hrothgar, something you seem to be completely devoid of.~
@478  = ~It was a jest Hrothgar, nothing more. Which, if you were capable of wit yourself, you would have recognised it for what it was.~
@479  = ~Sarcasm was not intended Hrothgar. It’s just that you complain every time we get side tracked that I never expected to hear you say *we must take time out*.~
@480  = ~I am not concerned with your opinion on whether I have wit or not <CHARNAME>. What I am concerned about is this leveller and the destruction its very name conjures up.~
@481  = ~If Ulcaster is to stand any chance against this assault by Halruaa, we have to make sure they have no aces up their sleeves to pull out, and it seems our best chance for that is to find and search this Brial person’s quarters for more clues to the whereabouts of these mages.~
@482  = ~I was about to suggest we do the exact same thing, if you’d have given me half a chance to speak Hrothgar! Now, let’s move it out of here, sharpish!~
@483  = ~There is no have Hrothgar, only have not, but it doesn’t take wit to come up with the idea to search this Brial’s quarters. It was to be my next move anyway so let’s set about it.~
@484  = ~You took the words right out of my mouth Hrothgar. Let us find this Brial’s quarters and attempt to lessen the size of that wave due to crash onto Ulcaster’s shores.~
@485  = ~You only hear it from now because the word *leveller* conjures up visions of a very powerful and destructive weapon... a weapon we can not allow to be deployed against Ulcaster.~
@486  = ~If this Brial can lead us to its hiding place then our best chance of finding any clue as to where that may be has to be a search of her quarters.~
@487  = ~We may even find the mage herself there, although, if we were to find her, I doubt she will surrender such information willingly.~
@488  = ~Discreetly, please <CHARNAME>! These tutors all seem to be pretty powerful wizards, we do not want to anger too many at once.~
@489  = ~Unfortunately this is no children’s game Dar, and as you say the prize will more than likely try to kill us when found, but for Ulcaster’s sake, we have no choice other than to follow the clues until we eventually find the prize.~
@490  = ~At least we know what to expect when the prize is found and we can be prepared for when it is revealed. Now, what does the letter say <CHARNAME>?~
@491  = ~Here read it for yourself Hrothgar... Damn this mage how are we supposed to find her when she does not give directions?~
@492  = ~Here read it for yourself Hrothgar... Let me guess, you are now going to suggest we search this Garron’s quarters, right Hrothgar?~
@493  = ~Here read it for yourself Hrothgar... This Garron appears to be a key player if he is to deploy the leveller. The more I hear about this damn leveller the less I like the sound of it.~
@494  = ~Here read it for yourself Hrothgar... Bah, once again I am sent scurrying to and fro like a mouse looking for tidbits!~
@495  = ~She has <CHARNAME>, all we have to do is find this Garron’s quarters and hope Brial was unable to find him and has left directions to the meeting for him.~
@496  = ~(*Sigh*) Right you are Hrothgar, lets get out of here and go find Garron’s quarters and put paid to these mages and their conspiracies once and for all!~
@497  = ~I am fast running out of patience with these mages. Why do they feel the need for all this secrecy when nearly all of  Halruaa knows what is afoot anyway? Come, let us go see what we can dig up in this Garron’s quarters.~
@498  = ~This Garron had better not be in his quarters when we get there or it will go badly for him. I am in no mood for a confrontation with a contrary mage!~
@499  = ~This is it Hrothgar, if Brial’s directions are not there, then I am done chasing mages and secret artifacts.~
@500  = ~More importantly, let us find and put paid to this leveller device.~
@501  = ~Calm yourself <CHARNAME>. Getting agitated is a sure way of making mistakes and getting yourself killed, and us along with you. We are close to our goal I am sure, so it will not hurt to employ discretion for a little while longer.~
@502  = ~If we can not find Brial’s directions to Garron then we will most certainly have to abandon our plan.~
@503  = ~As much as it galls me to leave such a destructive sounding device for Halruaa to deploy against Ulcaster, I can not help but think that if we fail it is because what has been was meant to be, and Tilorn will finally have to except this, but come, let us not concede defeat just yet, not until we have searched Garron’s Quarters.~
@504  = ~This Vrielle has instructed Brial to leave directions to the meeting in Garron’s quarters if she can not find him... that does seem to be the obvious place for us to search next. Let us hope she was unable to find him and we find these directions. Then we shall surely know where our quarry is, and with luck, the whereabouts of their infernal artifact.~
@505  = ~This is it Hrothgar, if Vrielle’s letter is not there, then I am done chasing mages and secret artifacts.~
@506  = ~But we have no need to scurry much further for our tidbits <CHARNAME>.~
@507  = ~See, this Vrielle writes that if Brial can not find Garron, then she is to leave directions to the meeting in his quarters. All we have to do is find out where they are, and with luck... the directions.~
@508  = ~Come, we are close to our quarry, and a step closer to aiding Ulcaster.~
@509  = ~(*Sighs*) Right you are Hrothgar, lets get out of here and go find Garron’s quarters and put paid to these mages and their conspiracies once and for all!~
@510  = ~I wish this was treasure hunting Minsc. When found, treasure is a lot more forgiving than mages who do not want be found. Let us hope this will be the last clue and we can be done with this hunt. What does it say <CHARNAME>?~
@511  = ~Well <CHARNAME>, does it tell us any more than Sebastian’s letter to Vrielle did? Does it gives anymore insight to what this leveller is or even where it can be found?~
@512  = ~We now know where to find our mages <CHARNAME>. We should move quickly, find this place, see what this meeting is about and destroy their infernal artifact.~
@513  = ~It might well have been the very thing Halruaa used to tip the balance in their favour in their assault on Ulcaster. If it was, and we manage to destroy it, then we have at least accomplished that which Tilorn sent us here to do.~
@514  = ~I am with you Hrothgar, let’s go.~
@515  = ~Then if this the break we have been looking for the sooner we sort these mages and find this leveller, the sooner we can get out of this rat hole.~
@516  = ~The directions are clear enough, what are we waiting for?~
@517  = ~According to these letters, this RayVon appears to have his finger in a lot of pies, I say we take him out after we have dealt with his first wave and their leveller.~
@518  = ~Let us try and do this discreetly <CHARNAME>, we do not want to bring the whole academy down on our heads!~
@519  = ~So it might to you Melora, but my concern is getting us all out of here in one piece, drawing attention to ourselves is a sure way of getting us all killed. Now I suggest we do as I said and continue *discreetly*, that way we don’t risk the wrath of Halruaa’s mages nor the likely hood of their magic bringing the building down around our heads.~
@520  = ~Then let us proceed as I said, *discreetly*. Hopefully that way, we will all be leaving here alive... I have no inclination to be burying anyone, whether it is beside mages or otherwise.~
@521  = ~(*Smiling at the ranger*) Don’t worry Minsc... when I said the whole *academy*, I was using the term *academy* as a collective name for all of Halruaa’s mages, not the building itself.~
@522  = ~I am with you there my friend, mages and their magic cause major headaches for us all. So now you see why we don’t want to bring the acad... all Halruaa’s mages down on our heads at once.~
@523  = ~We will have to move swiftly now <CHARNAME>, if we are to find this artifact and take it out of the picture. It will not be long  before news of what has happened here gets out.~
@524  = ~I agree, let’s go Hrothgar.~
@525  = ~As you say Hrothgar, let us move swiftly and not waste this opportunity to maybe make a difference.~
@526  = ~I have a feeling that this artifact isn’t going to be left unguarded and although the thought of battling another group of established magic users doesn’t thrill me, as you say Hrothgar, we have to try.~
@527  = ~Then for the honour of Ulcaster and maybe for the future of the Realms, let’s quickly find and destroy this artifact.~
@528  = ~We are not here to take out Halruaa Melora! We can not interfere to that extent, if we can do something that will help even the odds for Ulcaster in the coming assault or even prevent Halruaa launching its assault then that is all we can do. Now, if destroying this artifact brings about either of those effects, then that is what we are going to do.~
@529  = ~The effect of ending so many lives could be catastrophic Melora. Think for a second... your own father is a mage, it is therefore possible that he could have been a descendent of a tutor, or a student studying magic at the academy at this very time.~
@530  = ~So it follows, that killing all mages present in the academy now could inadvertently effect your birth. You may even cease to be Melora. A very good argument for not taking  Halruaa out don’t you think?~
@531  = ~However, we are wasting time standing here talking, there is a more pressing and urgent issue to address here. Right <CHARNAME>?~
@532  = ~(*Picking up and turning the artifact over in his hands.*) Mmm, no buttons to press or knobs to turn, I wonder how it works.~
@533  = ~Anybody seen anything like it before?~
@534  = ~Ok, we found it but it doesn’t seem to come with instructions, so what do we do with it?~
@535  = ~Hmph, it doesn’t look very impressive for a secret weapon.~
@536  = ~So this little thing is the Leveller. Seems a bit small to have such an impressive name to me.~
@537  = ~Looks no different to any other mages toy to me.~
@538  = ~Looks to me as though it may need a key in order to operate it. If it does, you can guarantee Vrielle was going to pick it up on her way here with Sebastian and Garron.~
@539  = ~My guess is RayVon has it or has secreted it away somewhere, which means it is still operational and still a threat to Ulcaster. As such I say we take it with us before he comes to claim it.~
@540  = ~If this artifact was the deciding factor in tipping the balance for Halruaa, our taking it may have done some good already.~
@541  = ~Then it is decided, we take it with us.~
@542  = ~We’ll not know anything until Tilorn gets us safely out of here, lets hope he does it before RayVon discovers his mages are dead and his artifact is missing.~
@543  = ~Why does everything seem to rely on keys around here?~
@544  = ~If it’s made by mages then it may not necessarily need a key, it could just as easily need some incantation of sorts to start the thing up.~
@545  = ~Then I suggest we get out of here and we don’t let this artifact out of our sights whilst we are on Halruaa’s soil.~
@546  = ~How it is operated is not important. What is important, is that we get it out of the academy’s hands as quickly as possible and make sure it stays out of their hands. Which means we need to get out of here and back to Tilorn quickly.~
@547  = ~Then it would be a good idea if we all got out of here before RayVon finds us, tipping the balance back in Halruaa’s favour and opening the way for all hell to fall on our heads. Let us take the artifact, with or without its key and hope the little we have done is enough.~
@548  = ~Tilorn I am sorry, we have failed you my friend. The wheels were turning even as we entered Halruaa and once started there was no way we could stop what had begun. You were right in your theory that Halruaa’s mages instigated the downfall of Ulcaster but we found no proof that what is happening now in the Realms had any connection with that event.~ [hrot_501]
@549  = ~This was an event of the past or at least originally started before our interventions and as such is out of our hands and who is to say that it is the disaster we see it for. The mages of Halruaa were proud and haughty yes, but maybe, just maybe it was their actions that shaped magic and magic users of today. There are still those who use it for destructive purposes but the majority are respectful of the power they hold in their hands. Perhaps Ulcaster was always fated to be a lesson to be taught.~ [hrot_502]
@550  = ~Tilorn, my friend, I almost forgot.~
@551  = ~Tilorn, we have tried it your way and failed as you yourself did, but all is not lost...~ [hrot503a]
@552  = ~(*Quietly almost to himself*) Farewell Tilorn my friend, I promise you, we will not fail this time... we cannot!~ [hrot_504]
@553  = ~When *will* you explain why we chase rainbows and waste time Hrothgar? Or is this to be another... *when the time is right <CHARNAME>?*~
@554  = ~Yes Hrothgar, do explain why you took us on this fool’s errand, wasting all of our time?~
@555  = ~As the man said, explain why I am wasting my time following you on doomed missions?~
@556  = ~I followed you in good faith Hrothgar, only to find you waste my time. Each day that passes the trail gets colder and lessens my chances to find Irenicus.~
@557  = ~Let me assure you <CHARNAME>, we have not lost much time, nor has your search for Irenicus and Imoen been delayed. Tilorn has returned us to the same place and time that we left. Yes it was an impossible feat, but if there was even the slightest chance that what Tilorn believed was true, then for all our sakes, we had to attempt it.~ [hrot_505]
@558  = ~I am not interested in your assurances, nor do I intend to follow blindly anymore. It is time to tell me the truth of what goes on here!~
@559  = ~Assurances are all well and good, but now it is time to do as Tilorn says and explain.~
@560  = ~This is getting freaky Hrothgar! I think it is about time you told me how Tilorn manages all these side trips through time.~
@561  = ~No more Hrothgar, I demand the truth, no more dancing around words!~
@562  = ~You are right, not only are you owed some explanations but there are things you now need to know. I had hoped Tilorn’s theory would enable us to correct things quickly, but since that has now failed, the artifact is our last best hope for the Realms.~ [hrot_506]
@563  = ~Go on.~
@564  = ~Some answers at last!~
@565  = ~You are darn right I am owed some answers!~
@566  = ~This will be difficult to express in words rather than in symbols but I will do my best so please bear with me. I don’t know what you understand about the true nature of the multi-universe but it is not what everyone generally thinks it is... or maybe it would be correct to say it is what people think... but either way, it is neither as straightforward nor as simple as most people believe.~ [hrot_523]
@567  = ~What we do know is that by a terrible accident or possible malevolent design, something in the past, present or even in the future went horribly wrong. Tilorn was convinced that it was the destruction of Ulcaster that prevented the discovery of the true cause of the chaos that we are witnessing today. Now, whether Ulcasters demise was also by accident or design we cannot be sure.~ [hrot_507]
@568  = ~Great... answers that make no sense!~
@569  = ~Well Tilorn’s theory was wrong and I am not sure that yours is going to be any more believable but carry on.~
@570  = ~The past, present and future can in theory be considered no more than, let us say, reflections of the world as you know it. Let us consider that if for every action and choice that you make there also exists a multitude of these “reflections” for the paths and choices you did not make. All of these possibilities of what is and what may have been need to be kept in balance...~ [hrot_508]
@571  = ~Hold on a minute here... are you saying that for every choice I did not make, that it is just possible other realities exist as if I had?~
@572  = ~But surely we then have to consider also the possibility of all these paths, realities whatever you call them being pre-set... just awaiting my decisions? If that is so, then who set these paths?~
@573  = ~Reality or virtuality, which is which? You sleep and dream but who is to say which is the dream and which is not? You perceive your world as real, but what of these other realities, would those worlds seem any less real to those that live in them? Just as you would perceive them as virtual, is your world not virtual to them? The multi-universe is such that how can we know, what is real and what is virtual, if that question can be said to even mean anything, and does it really matter, even to those living or dreaming in them?~ [hrot_509]
@574  = ~Of course it matters! You tell me everything and every one I know, that even I, may not be real. That all is merely a reflection of another reality or a dream in someone’s fevered brain and just expect me to believe this?~
@575  = ~This is all too weird for me Hrothgar. In laymen’s words, what are we doing here... what and where do we go next?~
@576  = ~I only ask that you consider all possibilities whilst I try to explain what has brought about this task that is set before us and how we are to end this cycle of chaos in order to restore the balance between past, present, future and... the *realities*.~ [hrot_511]
@577  = ~So you are saying that reality or this *multi-universe* that you talk about is falling apart. And that somehow, something connected to my life is causing this chaotic cycle of events leading to this collapse? I find this pretty hard to believe!~
@578  = ~Now you speak of cycle and balance Hrothgar and you lose me once again.~
@579  = ~Hrothgar, now you are just being pretentious or you ought to seek help pretty damn quick from a priest of Illmater. This is obviously delusional... being a child of Bhaal is one thing but being the cause of a series of cyclic events leading to a *multi-universal* collapse beggers belief!~
@580  = ~I speak of the cycle that surrounds “your reality”. The repetitions that has become your life, whether malevolently controlled by someone else or a blind chaotic accident it cannot be allowed to continue or the very fabric of the multi-universe is in peril.~ [hrot_525]
@581  = ~If you require further proof then consider my friend, how many times has a face seemed familiar on a new acquaintance or how often do you know, in a way beyond knowing, that you can trust or not trust someone... who means you harm and who will help you. Of new places you visit and yet know... of your actions and their outcomes. How often have feelings like these and pre-knowledge invaded your mind?~ [hrot_512]
@582  = ~If that is to be believed, why should I continue on... why not end my search now, put an end to this present cycle?~
@583  = ~Because you cannot. It matters not whether you continue your search for Imoen and Irenicus, whether your destiny is attained or you die now. The eventual outcome will always be the same, it will all *begin again* or should I say *begin anew*. Unless this cycle I speak of is broken it will continue until the death of the multi-universe.~ [hrot_526]
@584  = ~Even if the cycle is broken, there is no guarantee that it will be the end forever, nothing in the multi-universe can be guaranteed.~ [hrot_514]
@585  = ~Then how is this cycle to be broken?~
@586  = ~(*Sighs*) I suppose it should come as no surprise to me that I am the one called upon when someone is needed to save a multi-universe. What do we do Hrothgar?~
@587  = ~The dream when I travelled the portal from Kuldahar... it showed me...~
@588  = ~Who indeed my friend? Most of us believe in a God or Deities of some sort, it could well be that we are here for their amusement or for some other reason beyond our comprehension. This could well be a world of their making and we move along to their design in such a way that we believe we have freedom over our own actions and choices.~ [hrot_524]
@589  = ~Such that our freedom of choice, and predestination of their will, are only alternate faces of the same coin. The multi-universe is such, that how can we tell, what is real, virtual, freewill and destiny, and that is if these questions can be said to even mean anything; but does it really matter, even to those living or dreaming in them?~ [hrot_510]
@590  = ~Of course it matters! You tell me everything and every one I know, that even I, may not be real. That all is merely a reflection of another reality or a dream of some God and just expect me to believe this?~
@591  = ~This is all too weird for me Hrothgar. In laymen’s words, what are we doing here... 	what and where do we go next?~
@592  = ~A glimpse into another reality, a dream, a kind of truth or a lie? There is no way of knowing for sure what it was you experienced in the portal <CHARNAME>. However, what we do know is that unless we correct the balance and stop this chaos effect, then all that can be, the future, past and present of the Realms will never be. But in order to do this I will need your aid.~ [hrot_515]
@593  = ~And just how do we go about restoring balance and ending chaos?~
@594  = ~If I refuse my aid, what then Hrothgar?~
@595  = ~Tilorn has given you another of the keys, yes, that wardstone you hold in your hand. As well as being one of the keys I seek, it is a piece of a very powerful artifact, as are all the keys. Tilorn unfortunately had only two of the four, the one you now hold and the one he left with Arundel to pass on to me.~ [hrot_527]
@596  = ~The other two exist in other *times and other planes*, my place is to guide you to these in order to find and restore the artifact. You <CHARNAME> will know when to use or where to place the artifact to restore the balance and thus ending the chaos that threatens all.~ [hrot_516]
@597  = ~But what of Imoen? This mission is going to take sometime if we are to travel as far as you say. Is it fair that I should leave her imprisoned whilst I walk free?~
@598  = ~What of Irenicus? Even now I can see him gloat as he slips further away from me?~
@599  = ~And if I say no, what then Hrothgar?~
@600  = ~I have assured you any number of times that you will find both Imoen and Irenicus, my word on this <CHARNAME> is good, it is the way of your destiny in the ever tightening and expanding circle that has become reality. What more can I say to convince you?~ [hrot_517]
@601  = ~What you say sounds fantastic Hrothgar, but then so is a lot that has happened of late. Still if what you say is true then I have little choice other than to do what I can to resolve this.~
@602  = ~I will heed your words for now Hrothgar and pray that Imoen understands why I took so long in reaching her when I do eventually find her.~
@603  = ~If what you say is true then Irenicus has no more of a future than any of us. If restoring this artifact secures a future where I can send his black heart to the abyss, then we should set about it without delay.~
@604  = ~I have to wonder at your words Hrothgar and it seems that maybe it is your mind that is out of balance and not this multi-universe you speak of. I refuse to devote any more time to such an insane notion.~
@605  = ~The multi-universe, alternate realities, do you even hear yourself Hrothgar? We fight, we bleed, we die! How much more real does it have to get Hrothgar? Time, I think, for me to get back to reality as I know it and find Irenicus.~
@606  = ~Excellent, we have spent enough time on explanations for one day. Let us about the task ahead and talk some more when you have had time to take in and digest all that which you have learnt this day.~ [hrot_518]
@607  = ~I had hoped with your experiences, that your mind would be open enough to at least give some thought to all that I have said and not make so hasty a decision. Come, <CHARNAME>, travel with me a little longer, give yourself time to ponder on my words and question those experiences of yours. More importantly, trust your instincts, I have said before, they will not lead you wrong.~ [hrot_519]
@608  = ~I have learnt to live by my wits, not my instincts and it is they which tell me it is time to choose my own path and forget this nonsense.~
@609  = ~(*Sighs*) How is it you always manage to make me doubt the wisdom of my decisions? No matter, I will a bit further with you and think on your words. Come let us move before I change my mind.~
@610  = ~What do you know of my instincts? Maybe it is my instincts that are telling me that there is something wrong in all this?~
@611  = ~(*His voice slightly saddens*) Then there is no more that can be done, I will take my leave of you. You will continue as you must until such a time that chaos reigns and the realms and you yourself pass into legend. For this was your mission. I was to be but your guide. Fare thee well my friend.~ [hrot_520]
@612  = ~True, I know nothing of your instincts, they are an inborn part of you, there for you to act on. I only ask that you listen and consider my words, and hopefully what you then decide to do will come from what you feel to be right, not only for yourself but also for those entwined with you.~ [hrot_521]
@613  = ~It is simple, you can find Irenicus, rescue Imoen and reach your destiny, but whatever you decide the eventual outcome will always be the same, it will all *begin again* or should I say *begin anew* unless this cycle I speak of is broken you will continue to do so until such a time that chaos ultimately prevails and all that which is and is yet to be, no longer becomes an option.~ [hrot_522]
@614  = ~If an injustice has truly been done then we should do what we can to aid those enslaved and so cruelly used. Let us seek out this settlement and find the truth for ourselves, time is yet on our side.~
@615  = ~That was not necessary <CHARNAME>! Had you been more prudent in your answers, this could have been avoided. Now we have risked drawing attention to our presence so I suggest we get out quickly before this mess is discovered, and us along with it!~
@616  = ~I don’t have the time to listen to these pompous mages and their lies Hrothgar! We are here to do a job and I am doing it in the best way that I know how.~
@617  = ~Pussy footing around these mages takes time Hrothgar... time that we are rapidly running out of! Direct and swift action is what we now need, it yields results a lot quicker.~
@618  = ~Stop complaining Hrothgar, remember, you ask me to accompany you on this mission of yours! So let’s quit whining and get it done!~
@619  = ~I fear that this rashness of yours will bring this mission to a bad end, but our choices are made. We must continue and finish that which we have started. I pray the gods look benevolently upon us.~
@620  = ~If we have all sufficiently recovered then it looks as though we have yet another portal to travel.~
@621  = ~(*Pointing to the portal*)... As this is likely to be our only means of exiting from here, I suggest we take it... and quickly.~
@622  = ~I’m all for not being around when Irenicus returns. He’s as sure as hell missed us by now and will be one angry wizard.~
@623  = ~Then what are we waiting for... whatever is on the other side of this portal can’t be any more menacing than the demon we vanquished.~
@624  = ~I’m as ready as I’ll ever be and I swear, if Irenicus is on the other side of this portal, he’ll not catch me napping this time!~
@625  = ~I think he is wise enough to know that you, Imoen, would have any ordinary door, lock picked and opened in a flash... thus allowing his birds to fly the coop.~
@626  = ~(*He puts his arm around the terrified girl*)... Believe me, if I thought it‘s possible then I would teleport us in an instant. Unfortunately, I have no idea how far beneath the ground this dungeon is, I couldn’t guarantee getting us all out safely.~
@627  = ~This wizard is also very clever and cunning, I feel that he has wards of a sort around the place to prevent our use of teleportation. It would be too great a risk for me to attempt to teleport us past them...~
@628  = ~But come, take heart Imoen, maybe these last couple of steps are all that you need take to find your freedom, and to feel the warmth of your sun on your face again.~
@629  = ~Hrothgar is right Imoen. We have already explored the whole of this area and we found only the two portals. If we hope to flee this place then this is the only option open to us.~
@630  = ~In our haste to leave we didn’t finish exploring this area, maybe we missed something Imoen... maybe there are hidden exits that Irenicus has forgotten about in his preference for portals. Perhaps a little further exploration wouldn’t go amiss.~
@631  = ~This is not the time to be blubbering Imoen, Irenicus may return at any moment. So, if you want your freedom, you’ll shut up and do as I say.... got it?~
@632  = ~If this Irenicus uses these portals himself, then maybe we should explore this area further before committing ourselves. Perhaps we can find another means of escape that will lessen the risk of us running into him.~
@633  = ~I explored this area thoroughly before I took the decision to enter the portal. I found two portals and then... only the one which transported me to Easthaven was accessible at the time. As I see it, we have no other choice left to us, but to take this one.~
@634  = ~I admit, in my haste to secure my freedom, I did leave areas unexplored... I suppose I could have missed something. Maybe a little further exploration wouldn’t go amiss.~
@635  = ~I didn’t just stumble blindly through the first portal I found! I searched this area completely before making that choice... there is no other way! Now I suggest we stop talking and start walking!~
@636  = ~Then let us move, and may the gods grant that we find our freedom quickly and safely.~
@637  = ~I am sure that if there were another exit, our young friends here would not have taken the portal that stranded them in Easthaven. I am sorry Dar but I suspect this portal is our only escape.~
@638  = ~Not again Dar! Look, I am going through this portal with or without you... you decide!~
@639  = ~I agree my friend. I can not imagine that there would be two such abominations loose in our world, but there is still the problem of this Irenicus.~
@640  = ~If he uses these portals himself then maybe we should explore this area further before committing ourselves. Perhaps we can find another means of escape that will lessen the risk of us running into him.~
@641  = ~Yet more intrigue designed to embroil us in the affaires of this city! We really don’t have time for these intrigues <CHARNAME>, there are far more important issues that need our attention right now.~
@642  = ~No matter what we may think of our visitor’s cryptic message, we are no closer to speaking with Leina’s father. Our path is barred, so I suggest we report back to Samuel and explain the circumstances as they stand... we can do no more for now.~
@643  = ~We all miss Leina, she was so full of life and brought so much joy with her love of music. All that she ever wanted to do was to show the rest of the world the joy that music could bring. If we can do one thing for her memory and that is to ensure that her music continues.~
@644  = ~Perhaps a book with all the songs and melodies that she ever gave birth to, as she likened the coming about of a new song or melody... written for all to read that they may experience the joy that her music can bring.~
@645  = ~We can not be sure what goes on the heads of the mages here <CHARNAME>, it is troubled times and we are in the thick of it.~
@646  = ~Be careful <CHARNAME>. If you mention Ezekiel’s involvement you can be sure he will mention ours.~
@647  = ~Let us move quickly and step up our search <CHARNAME>, I fear it will not be long before the net closes around Ezekiel and us with him.~
@648  = ~What ever possessed you to tell her that <CHARNAME>? Suppose Ezekiel tells her it was you who did the body snatching? We still have much to do and do not need the likes of angry mages on our tails!~
@649  = ~I am wondering how long we have until your lie is discovered <CHARNAME>? I could see the determination in her eyes.~
@650  = ~Relax Hrothgar. Sounds like Ezekiel is no stranger to trouble. She will expect him to try and lie his way out of it.~
@651  = ~You heard what she said, *banished this time*. Ezekiel has obviously been up to other dirty tricks, she’ll not believe anything he says.~
@652  = ~Sounds like this is not the first time those two have crossed paths. She is out to rid the academy of him and will regard anything he says as a ploy to shift blame.~
@653  = ~Uh... excuse me Hrothgar, but I do not remember going into the tomb alone?~
@654  = ~It’s just a way of saying that we do not want mages chasing behind us Minsc. Is that not so <CHARNAME>?~
@655  = ~All the same I wish you had not said anything, but it is too late now. Let us hope you are right and Ezekiel’s reputation will prevent us having to answer for your part in this sordid business.~
@656  = ~That as may be, but Ezekiel is sure to tell her of our part in this sordid business... and by the look on her face, she will be confronting the necromancer sooner than later.~
@657  = ~For now, I suggest we make ourselves scarce and stay alert as she is certain to let others know to be on the look out for us.~
@658  = ~An unnecessary death! A death brought about by your insistence on interfering with academy affairs <CHARNAME>! We should be getting on with the real reason for our being here and not recklessly risking our necks as well as the mission.~
@659  = ~Wow, what’s with the heavy words Hrothgar? We are still in one piece aren’t we?~
@660  = ~We have to appear to be a part of this academy Hrothgar and I know no better way then getting involved in its affairs.~
@661  = ~If you have a better way of finding what ever it is you are looking for then I am open to suggestions. If you don’t then we continue to do it my way!~
@662  = ~I have put my own responsibilities, namely the rescue of Imoen, and my search for Irenicus, to one side to help you in this search Hrothgar. The least you can do is cut me some slack.~
@663  = ~For now. If you carry on as you are it will not be long before we are blown to thousands of pieces by some mages fireball or worse. All I am saying is we must be more circumspect than we have been up to now if we are to survive this place.~
@664  = ~As I see it being circumspect is not really an option here, not with an academy full of mind reading mages.~
@665  = ~If you don’t like the way I am going about this, you can always take off by yourself and do your own search Hrothgar.~
@666  = ~I have no intentions of dying here Hrothgar, and unless you have more constructive ideas we get this job done my way.~
@667  = ~There’s getting involved and there’s getting involved. I am not against discreet interaction with the mages here, but we are vulnerable. If we should accidentally alert the academy to our presence our chances of getting out of here with our lives is zero. All I am saying is we should be more circumspect than we have been up to now if we are to survive this place.~
@668  = ~And I am grateful that you have enough trust in me to put Imoen’s welfare second to my request. However, we must be more circumspect than we have been up to now if we are to survive this place.~
@669  = ~Astute words my friend. We would we wise to listen to Dar <CHARNAME>, we can not do this as and all survive if we squabble amongst ourselves. Come, let us put our differences aside and leave this area quickly... before someone comes upon us and sees fit to summon a tutor..or two!~ ~Astute words my friend. We would be wise to listen to Dar <CHARNAME>, we can not do this as and all survive if we squabble amongst ourselves. Come, let us put our differences aside and leave this area quickly... before someone comes upon us and sees fit to summon a tutor... or two!~
@670  = ~Jaheira is right <CHARNAME> we are attracting attention stood here. Come, let us put our differences aside and leave this area quickly... before someone comes upon us and sees fit to summon a tutor... or two!~
@671  = ~Look about us <CHARNAME>, we are attracting too much attention stood here with a dead mage at our feet. For the safety of the group we should put our differences aside and get out of this area quickly... before someone comes upon us and sees fit to summon a tutor... or two!~
@672  = ~We can do no more for the dead, we must worry for ourselves now.~
@673  = ~Then I suggest we say a quick prayer for those poor souls buried behind and make all haste to Kuldahar.~
@674  = ~If our only portal home was in Easthaven, then I guess that avalanche has sealed our fate in more ways than one. We have no choice now but to go on to Kuldahar.~
@675  = ~If this is that wizard’s doing to make sure we never return to Easthaven, I swear I will learn of any predecessors of his living in this time and hunt down and kill every last one of them! No matter how far I have to walk to find them!~
@676  = ~It is imperative that we speak to Arundel about what has occurred here, and soon... but hold, we are in luck, there is a stranger ahead, maybe he can tell us more.~
@677  = ~Yours is the decision to make <CHARNAME>.~
@678  = ~No need to worry, Shar-Teel. Let’s go.~
@679  = ~We retrieved this artifact from a group of Halruaan mages as they were preparing to unleash it on Ulcaster. The mages called it the leveller, an infernal name if ever I heard one... obviously our finding it had no effect on the final outcome as we had hoped.~
@680  = ~We were not able to discover its purpose, so I give it to you to take to our brethren. I can think of no safer place for it to be... for I fear, that should its secrets be discovered and it be deployed, it is a weapon that will bring mass destruction.~
@681  = ~No we are not, nor were we ever going to blow up the academy Taffic. Melora is just being Melora, and expressing how much delight she would take in bringing Halruaa and its mages down permanently.~
@682  = ~You’ve made your opinion of men very clear Shar-Teel... in fact you’ve reminded us so many times that I am beginning to wonder whether it’s us or yourself you are trying to convince.~
@683  = ~(*Sternly*) Listen here my girl, you knew the nature of this mission before we left Easthaven! If you were not happy to follow with the rest of the group, then you should have stayed behind. I don’t recall anyone forcing this quest upon you.~
@684  = ~Now if it is your intention to remain with the group, then please keep your disparaging remarks to yourself! No one here, least of all me, wants to listen to you harping on continuously.~
@685  = ~We all need to watch out for each other and quite frankly, your attitude is such that I’m not entirely sure that I want you watching my back Shar-Teel!~
@686  = ~Then I guess we understand each other a little better... now to continue with our mission.~
@687  = ~Please, I believe a little respect is called for here Shar-Teel. Erevaine had the courage and determination to try to help the people of Kuldahar, even though he must have known his efforts were doomed to failure but he at least tried! Now surely even you can respect bravery and courage in a man?~
@688  = ~(*Sternly*) Berating each other after the event is not going to change the situation! None here are blessed with foresight so we have to make the most of what is, not what could have been.~
@689  = ~Now, my concern is for Arundel, we may yet be in time to save him if we move quickly...~
@690  = ~(*Sensing the group’s unease and fearing that things are about to get out of hand he interrupts*)~
@691  = ~Enough! Shar-Teel, I see no point to this tirade other than to cause devilry so if you’ve nothing to say relevant to the situation, then hold that sharp tongue of yours and allow <CHARNAME> to make the decision!~
@692  = ~Yes, and we are very grateful for all this thought Minsc. I am sure Melora meant to say so... didn’t you Melora?~
@693  = ~A wise decision <CHARNAME>. I have learnt to respect but not to trust dragonkin... especially those who, like this one, ooze malevolence from every pore of their scaly hides!~
@694  = ~(*Wipping the sweat from his forehead*) I'm greatful, my friend, for all you have done for the people of Icewind Dale.~
@695  = ~Do you understand, Hrothgar, that today and now I have changed my history, the history of the whole world. I even don't know if I ever come back to my own time and to my world, the very same world I have left, and you're just saying "you're grateful".~
@696  = ~And what am I supposed to say? You saved the people of my town, of all Ten Towns in Icewind Dale and maybe of all Faerun. You saved my life. Of course, I am grateful.~
@697  = ~Don't be upset <CHARNAME>. As I have already explained you, history sometimes should be changed for the sake of order and ballance.~
@698  = ~We introduce only those changes which save human and semi-human societies from extinction. But I understand that you see things differently, from your own perspective, and only within your very short period of time.~
@699  = ~But what is my role in all that? Did you or your friends bring me into this time to help you with your small problem of "changing history"?~
@700  = ~I cannot answer this question now, but you'll know the reason for being a chosen one very soon.~
@701  = ~I have been recruited into this particular society in order to make a specific change that would bring this society itself into being. Now my duties are over here, and I have to report to my brethren.~
@702  = ~Here is Jerrod's Stone, <CHARNAME>. This is your way back home.~
@703  = ~Again, thank you for your help, and hopefully we'll see each other again in your future... or in my past.~
@704  = ~(*Looking around*) Good, Kuldahar still stands. We are in time and also in luck, the portal appears to have returned us not far from the date we left. The old enemy, or whatever name this evil goes by, will not have had time to gain the advantage.~
@705  = ~It was time for our return. You are safe as I promised <CHARNAME> you would be, and now <PRO_HESHE> is free to aid me in finishing that which we started, putting an end to the evil which invades my home.~
@706  = ~Imoen please, I am not so insensitive that I don’t know how distressing the last weeks have been for you, for both you and <CHARNAME> but trust me, if I didn’t know that all will be well in time, then I would not have presumed to return so soon. As it is...~
@707  = ~(*Speaking sharply*) You’re an intelligent young woman, you don’t need me to point out that this time has nothing to do with yours or <CHARNAME>’s destiny.~
@708  = ~What lies ahead for you both does so in your own time, so the sooner we set about ridding my time of this evil, the sooner you’ll return to face whatever your future holds for you!~
@709  = ~The portal is closed, Imoen, as you see. I'm really sorry, portals are accessible only for a short period of time.~
@710  = ~But as I said before, if you lose one portal, another will be found and you will see your time again.~
@711  = ~We should make haste to Dorn’s Deep. Travelling to Dorn's Deep will in no way affect your future, where as not travelling there could well affect the lives of those who, are at present, living in your future time.~
@712  = ~Hold on one second here, I thought it was agreed, you help me take care of Irenicus and then we return?~
@713  = ~Returns us now Hrothgar, or by the nine hells you’ll burn along with Irenicus and that demon he calls sister in the deepest pit of the abyss!~
@714  = ~Curses on you Hrothgar! You’d better have a darn good reason for whisking me back here just when I had Irenicus in my sights!~
@715  = ~What’s this Hrothgar? You ask me to trust you, to aid you, and then you go back on your promise to chase down Irenicus with me?~
@716  = ~Once again I find myself having to apologise for my hasty move. I am sorry my friend but I could feel time closing in and running out for my people.~
@717  = ~I sensed the flux of time as it pulsed from within the portal and knew I had to act quickly, act before the moment was lost and before irreparable harm was done to your future and to the future of my people.~
@718  = ~I was left with little choice other than to attune the portal to bring us here. I am sorry but time, as is always within these portals, was moving swiftly, I had but a few seconds to make the adjustments before we stepped through.~
@719  = ~You must all understand, my stay in the future was never meant to be permanent, although I had hoped it would be long enough to lend my hand to chasing down Irenicus and restoring that which he has stolen.~
@720  = ~Unfortunately it is true what is said about time and tide waiting for no man.~
@721  = ~In this instance the pull of time was threatening to loosen itself from my control and I could sense the consequences of my uninvited presence in your time beginning to disrupt that which must be allowed to come to pass.~
@722  = ~This I should have explained, but what is done is done. I can not return to the future for the reasons I have explained but it is possible for you to do so if you wish.~
@723  = ~(*He takes an object from his pocket and gives it to you*) As long it is in your possession, this artifact will allow you to travel freely between our two times.~
@724  = ~I am thinking that by returning us here you still need my aid. If that is so, then I need to hear more than "trust me" this time.~
@725  = ~You hand me an artifact capable of teleporting me back and forth through time and that’s it, still no explanation as to what’s really going on here?~
@726  = ~I am sorry, but unless you can explain what it is you are really doing, hurling us back and forth through time, I am returning for Irenicus and you’re on your own from here on!~
@727  = ~What do you mean "time was threatening to loosen itself from your control?"~
@728  = ~No more Hrothgar! My own salvation is now my priority, not the fate of strangers who live only in the annals of history. I am returning before it is too late, before I no longer have a life to return to. This is farewell.~
@729  = ~I am sorry Hrothgar, if it were but my own salvation at stake here, I would willingly take up arms and stand beside you. However, another innocent has suffered due to her association with me. I regret,  I must return and right the dreadful wrong Irenicus has wrought upon both Imoen and myself. Farewell my friend and good luck with your quest.~
@730  = ~If you are determined to leave then I will not delay you, even though it means without your aid my people are surely doomed, for I am certain, one man alone can not hope to defeat that which threatens them.~
@731  = ~Tell me <CHARNAME>, if I were to assure you that any time you use here will have no adverse effect on you, nor will Irenicus gain any advantage due to your absence, would you then re-consider and aid me and my people?~
@732  = ~I can not waste any more time on the past. Irenicus has not only stolen my destiny but also my future, a thing he will pay dearly for when I send him to meet his own future among the beasts of the abyss!~
@733  = ~Perhaps... if you stop dancing around my questions and tell me who you and how a man from the past knows so much about the future...my future?~
@734  = ~(*As he looks into your eyes, you in turn, see disappointment reflected in his*) Then there is no more to be said.~
@735  = ~I will travel to Dorn’s Deep alone and pray that the gods grant me strength to do what must be done, or at least that I may find companions willing to take up the burden along the way.~
@736  = ~As for the fate of the realms, well that may yet be decided should we ever cross paths again, perhaps another time, another future.~
@737  = ~Keep the artifact <CHARNAME>. I am not sure how long our two time lines will remain aligned, but whilst they are and should you return, look for me at Dorn’s Deep.~
@738  = ~Seek out Larrel in The Severed Hand, he will guide you to the dwarven hold. Farewell and good luck in your future.~
@739  = ~Yes, your questions are deserving of answers. You have been patient and now I will tell you some of why I have remained silent for so long.~
@740  = ~Firstly, you must believe me when I say that I fully intended to aid you chase down Irenicus.~
@741  = ~I had hoped for more time in order to explore the future, to be able to seek out anything that would direct my path. I did not expect to be forced to return leaving so much undone.~
@742  = ~The future can not support a past that holds unresolved issues, issues that I left unresolved I should have realised that, eventually, time would catch up with me and this is what was beginning to happen.~
@743  = ~I could sense around me the beginnings of disruption, I knew that without the knowledge of how events in my own life concluded, I would lose control of the whole time sequences of events, past, present and future.~
@744  = ~Thus causing havoc to the balance of time and putting the destinies of all those around me in jeopardy.~
@745  = ~Woah, one minute here Hrothgar! 'YOU' would lose control over time! Are you saying you are able to control time, that you could have prevented all that Irenicus has put Imoen and myself through?~
@746  = ~Uh, you are losing me again Hrothgar. How is it possible for a man to control a sequence of events in time?~
@747  = ~Tell me Hrothgar, apart from yourself and Tilorn, how many others are there like you, going around altering time to suit yourselves?~
@748  = ~Who are you Hrothgar, and don’t give me the mayor of Easthaven drivel? You’re not simply mayor of a little town on The Spine Of the World. I think it’s fair to assume somewhere along the way, a whole chunk of this legend got left out, or even mislaid, deliberately!~
@749  = ~What are you Hrothgar, man, wizard, demon or something greater, because I’m as sure as hell that no ordinary man goes around professing to be in control of time?~
@750  = ~I am sorry, your destiny is such that even I dare not intervene. A far higher order than mine has decreed that none shall interfere, more about that I can not... dare not say.~
@751  = ~My order only acts when the balance between the times shift, threatening to give a permanent advantage to either good or evil, not to ease a person’s road through this journey we call life.~
@752  = ~Whereas we agree it is necessary to tolerate the presence of both good and evil in the world, it is also necessary that the balance between them be maintained.~
@753  = ~It is true, there will always be the battle between the two and each in turn may gain advantage for a brief time, but if one or the other should gain a permanent hold then chaos will ensue.~
@754  = ~To prevent this happening, it sometimes becomes necessary to travel to the past to correct an event in history when it’s outcome is discovered to be detrimental to this delicate balance in some future time.~
@755  = ~What is this mysterious order that you mention and what does it have to do with these keys that you are so bent on finding?~
@756  = ~You are still only giving me half a story Hrothgar. I don’t like secrets, especially when my life often depends on the one keeping them.~
@757  = ~Yet more riddles and mystery! You’d have me believe you’re a member of some secret society of time travellers. If that is so, then how is it I’ve never met your like before?~
@758  = ~An order which goes around altering history, bah! This sounds like more fabrications to keep the truth from me and I am growing tired of them! I am done with them and with you. I am returning to my own future, or to whatever the future may hold for me. I bid you farewell Hrothgar of Easthaven, whoever you may be.~
@759  = ~This mysterious order of yours didn’t help Ulcaster much did it?~
@760  = ~Mine is an order that exists solely to watch and maintain the balance between the past, present and future. To do this we need to be able, to a certain extent, control time itself.~
@761  = ~We are called into action when the balance between the times shift, threatening to give a permanent advantage to either good or evil.~
@762  = ~To those who know of us, and there are but a few high up among the various orders who know of our existence, we are known as the Brotherhood of the Moon.~
@763  = ~It is to our advantage to have the races of this world believe us to be nothing more than a myth.~
@764  = ~It is not certain how we came by our name, but it is said that when the sun shines there is very little that can hide from her brilliance. However, when the moon shows herself the blackness of the night still hides much from a man’s sight.~
@765  = ~Both however mark the passing of time and time being one of our tools, plus it is imperative that our work remains secret. Those who were before us, or so we have come to believe, took their name from the moon and the darkness about her.~
@766  = ~As you can imagine, in unscrupulous hands, our knowledge would bring only misery and chaos to the world.~
@767  = ~Whether it be a pious hand which believes it is right to rid the world of all that is evil, or an evil hand that uses it to bring down all that is good. Neither must be allowed to become the single most power in the world.~
@768  = ~You see now why my silence has been necessary, not through any mistrust of you but to prevent word that a Brother of the Moon walked the land reaching the ears of the owners of those unscrupulous hands I speak of.~
@769  = ~I suppose it’s just possible it is as you say, but what of the keys you seek Hrothgar? How do they fit into all this?~
@770  = ~So, is it for this Brotherhood of the Moon that you seek theses keys? If so, then what do they want with them? What is their purpose?~
@771  = ~From what has transpired of late, I can almost believe you speak the truth my friend, but you still haven’t said why it is these keys of yours are spread through out time. What are they the keys to? What mysteries do they unlock?~
@772  = ~Yes, I understand a little more now and I also see the immense burden your order must shoulder my friend. If you truly believe that my aid is essential in finding these keys, for whatever purpose, then we’d best resolve those issues of yours here and get back to doing just that.~
@773  = ~Yes, I understand a little more of the immense burden you shoulder my friend, but you must also understand that my destiny doesn’t lie in the past, it never has. Irenicus has changed the path I must now follow whether I wish to or not. I am sorry but I must wish you luck and take my leave of you.~
@774  = ~Bah, such arrogance I’ve only heard in mention of the gods! If you truly believe that it is for you to alter history in the belief that you do so for the good of the future, then I want no part of your madness. I’ll not change my mind again. This is farewell Hrothgar.~
@775  = ~Ah Tilorn, he has always believed that Ulcaster academy and all it’s knowledge should be standing today.~
@776  = ~It was his belief that Ulcaster had predicted much of how the realms would be shaped in future years and how eventually, many years after his passing, some catastrophe would strike, leaving chaos and ruin in its wake.~
@777  = ~All of which, or so he believes, Ulcaster recorded in the libraries of his academy. Hence Tilorn’s insistence that Ulcaster must be saved in order to preserve these records, maybe even return his memories to the  ghost Ulcaster, who could then pass his knowledge on to us.~
@778  = ~Although I would not dare to say as much to Tilorn, but I hope his failure, and ours, to prevent the fall of  Ulcaster will make him realise that, whereas there are episodes in the past  that need us to correct, there are those that we never can change, no matter how much we may wish it.~
@779  = ~I believe that time has, either a way of safeguarding that which must come to pass, or there are some things truly lay in the hands of the gods.~
@780  = ~For the moment the function of these keys is not fully known to me. I believe their purpose will be revealed only when they have all been found.~
@781  = ~I am sorry but I can offer you no further explanation other than it is my task to seek them out and you are the one to aid me, though who is guiding who where I am not sure.~
@782  = ~Sometimes it feels that I am but a guide showing you the way, and yet you have no more knowledge of their whereabouts or purpose than I. Curious, but then so is this reality of ours.~
@783  = ~All I can be sure of is that destiny, for whatever reason, has brought us together for the task.~
@784  = ~Your words stir a memory... a vision... as I fell through the portal. I remember seeing  you having much the same discussion with Gorion. I am not so sure it was a dream now, but I do remember Gorion trusted you, so I too will trust your words and aid you in this task that you say has been set before us.~
@785  = ~Then to the abyss with Irenicus, if what you say is true then he isn’t going anywhere! After all, we have time on our side but your people do not, so let us to Dorn’s Deep and chase this evil from your land once and for all.~
@786  = ~Thank you for trusting me with the truth at last, it’s been a long time coming. As fantastic as your story sounds to me, I feel for once you are being straight with me, just as I feel it is right that I follow you to Dorns deep. So no more talk, let us be on our way.~
@787  = ~Thank you for trusting me with the truth at last, it’s been a long time coming. However, you must understand that my destiny doesn’t lie in the past, it never has. Irenicus has changed the path I must now follow whether I wish to or not. I am sorry but I must wish you luck and take my leave of you.~
@788  = ~A pretty tale, it may be truth and it may not. However, nothing you have said convinces me that your concerns are mine. On the other hand, Irenicus is my concern... he, I will not find here in the past. It is time for me to return and take back that which is rightfully mine.~
@789  = ~It seems my order was right to put their faith in you <CHARNAME>.~
@790  = ~I promise you, once I have resolved these events in my life, then it will be safe for me to return to the future and help you resolve your own.~
@791  = ~Come, we must speak once more with Larrel at The Severed Hand. For if he has regained his power, then his hand is our quickest road to Dorn’s Deep.~
@792  = ~I believe the gnome’s obsession has caused his mind to become unbalanced we need to watch him further and be prepared to take action if he tries to endanger the group through his foolhardiness.~
@793  = ~(*Interrupting their tirade*) Not now Taffic... (*Turning to Melora*)... and Melora, Taffic is right.~
@794  = ~We do not  want this mage unleashing his magic... we have to act first and fast. So I suggest you save your differences until later... much later!~
@795  = ~He isn’t going to wait much longer for an answer <CHARNAME>.~
@796  = ~Curses! This I do not need!~
@797  = ~I think the time for talking has just run out!~
@798  = ~I have a bad feeling about this! I just know you are not going to listen to whatever I say!~
@799  = ~I may yet talk us out of this Hrothgar.~
@800  = ~Come off it you two, <CHARNAME> doesn’t need the hassle of your petty disagreements.~
@801  = ~Please, at least try to get along for all our sakes, we have enough worries without you two at each others throats all the time.~
@802  = ~Thank you Hrothgar. Now, cut it out you two, or neither of you will be following anyone if you don’t learn to do as Hrothgar says.~
@803  = ~I decide who is leading who, not you Melora, nor you  Taffic. So will you two please quit arguing and get in line!~
@804  = ~Taffic, no one is asking you to follow Melora, but if you really feel you prefer the company of the demons of the abyss to those present, then please be my guest!~
@805  = ~(*Sighs*) Why those two behave as they do towards each other beats me.~
@806  = ~They both have barks worse than their bites and whereas I don’t ever see them coming to blows, it would be nice not to have to separate them so often just in case.~
@807  = ~Ah, well... I suppose as long as the rest of the group aren't disturbed by their little altercations, they are a useful enough pair.~
@808  = ~You two please, this is not the place to be airing your differences. We are getting out of here now and taking the artifact with us.~
@809  = ~Now who carries it and what we do with it is up to <CHARNAME>, so both of you shut up before we are discovered and the wrath of Halruaa rains down on our heads.~
@810  = ~It is noble of you to want to help these people <CHARNAME>, but we really do not have the luxury of time being on our side.~
@811  = ~Any detour we make now takes valuable time away from our search. There is more at stake here than the lives of a few unfortunate people.~
@812  = ~So you keep saying Hrothgar, but it is a sad day when we cannot spare a little time to help those less fortunate in the world. I have decided, we go to Candlekeep.~
@813  = ~I cannot leave these people without some hope Hrothgar. Take a good look at them, What chance do they have alone?~
@814  = ~*More at stake* you say, Hrothgar. Well until you are prepared to tell me a little more of what is at *stake*, I will decide what is more important, and at the moment I say it is the welfare of these people.~
@815  = ~What you say is right of course <CHARNAME> and it would have been with a heavy heart that I would abandon them, but...~
@816  = ~I see from the expression on your face that you have no intentions of doing so no matter what I say.~
@817  = ~If we are to make our way to Candlekeep, then let us make all haste to get this sorted.~
@818  = ~Dar is right <CHARNAME>, I cannot sanction such an action! If you go ahead with this plan then your soul will be damned as surely as that of any slavers’!~
@819  = ~I am saddened and sickened by what I see here this day <CHARNAME>, but I am not here to judge, that will be for the gods to do in time.~
@820  = ~In time we shall see who judges who Hrothgar, but for now, my life is mine to live any way I choose.~
@821  = ~You may be right Hrothgar, but for now and as long as you travel with me, I prefer you to keep your sanctimonious mutterings to yourself.~
@822  = ~Can a god sit in judgement on a god Hrothgar? No-one knows where my destiny lies, only time and fate will decide that. So anything you have to say about passing judgment does not bother me for now.~
@823  = ~Think long on your actions in this life <CHARNAME> for they are what will ultimately decide your destiny.~
@824  = ~Whilst it is a relief to hear you no longer intend to take the way of the slaver and now intend to help these people <CHARNAME>, but we really do not have the luxury of time being on our side.~
@825  = ~I never thought to hear you say we have no time to help those in need Hrothgar. Well, I say we do have time and we start on the road immediately.~
@826  = ~I never thought to hear such words from a knight Hrothgar. Tell me again a knight’s code of conduct? No, on second thoughts don’t. I do not need to hear it. It is my decision to make for Candlekeep and that is where we are heading, now!~
@827  = ~We are going to Candlekeep Hrothgar. My decision is not up for debate!~
@828  = ~I will not argue <CHARNAME>, this is by far a more honourable path than the one you first intended, and it would have been with a heavy heart that I would abandon them.~
@829  = ~If we are to make our way to Candlekeep, then let us do so in all haste and get this sorted.~
@830  = ~Candlekeep, a fortress of knowledge <CHARNAME>, but there are not many privileged enough to sample it.~
@831  = ~Strange, it used to look so much bigger when Imoen and I lived here.~
@832  = ~The second time I left this town, I swore there was nothing that would entice me to return again.~
@833  = ~This place never did hold much joy for me Hrothgar. So let us do what we came here to do and leave as quickly as possible.~
@834  = ~You spoke as though you have knowledge of this place Hrothgar... in my dream... you and Gorion together... how?~
@835  = ~That was because this place was all you knew <CHARNAME>. The mind cannot fathom anything larger if it has nothing to compare with.~
@836  = ~Imoen and I, we used to disappear for hours at a time, I look around and wonder where ever did we find so many places to hide for so long. Now of course I see that Gorion knew exactly where we were every time, I guess he was content in knowing that we were safe. (*Sigh*) Oh... Imoen, why did you follow us on that fateful day? You would be safe now if you had not let your curiosity get the better of you!~
@837  = ~I have plenty to compare it to now Hrothgar, and I see just how safe we were inside its walls... Gorion... myself... Imoen...~
@838  = ~Life has a habit of turning full circle at some point in most people’s lives <CHARNAME>.~
@839  = ~Perhaps you will appreciate the tranquillity of Candlekeep more now after experiencing the bustle of the cities.~
@840  = ~Full circle you say Hrothgar, if you believe that than you must hope to return to Easthaven some day. When your quest is done?~
@841  = ~I would just prefer to do what we came here to do and leave again as quickly as possible.~
@842  = ~I have grown to enjoy the bustle of the city Hrothgar, there is a lot more life in them. No, Candlekeep is no longer the home for me that it once was. Let us do what we came here to do and leave again as quickly as possible.~
@843  = ~Then let us make for the inn, always a good place to listen and learn about the comings and goings of a town.~
@844  = ~That was, as I explained <CHARNAME>, a hallucination brought on through travel via the portal. Nothing sinister, it happens sometimes.~
@845  = ~Now let us make for the inn, always a good place to listen and learn about the comings and goings of a town.~
@846  = ~Once again, I know the futility in pursuing this with you Hrothgar, but soon you will have to answer my questions.~
@847  = ~I will let it go for now Hrothgar, but I will have my answers from you and sooner rather than later!~
@848  = ~(*Putting a hand on your shoulder*), Imoen will be back with you <CHARNAME>, I have promised you this.~
@849  = ~I know Hrothgar, it is just all the memories that are stored here, Imoen and I growing up, Gorion, his death, being here brings it all back.~
@850  = ~I know that I have always said it does no good dwelling on if onlys but I look around here and wish, if only I could have remained here, oblivious to what fate or destiny had in mind for me.~
@851  = ~Imoen would so much like to be here now Hrothgar, she is forever saying how much she longs to see Candlekeep again someday.~
@852  = ~My, Imoen is going to be real mad when she learns that I have been back to Candlekeep without her!~
@853  = ~None can say what the gods or fate has mapped out for us <CHARNAME>.~
@854  = ~Like you, for now I will go where directed, and at the moment the place for both of us to be is here. So let us go find this prophet for Dar shall we?~
@855  = ~Trust me, when the time is right, you will have your answers my friend.~
@856  = ~We both know that we cannot change what has passed, it is after all the past that shapes us into the people fate destined us to be.~
@857  = ~For now, the present dictates that we have the future to sort <CHARNAME>, so let us start by sorting the present by asking at the inn about this prophet and then we can continue to look into what is to be done about the future.~
@858  = ~Imoen will have the rest of her life to see Candlekeep again <CHARNAME>, it is up to us to make sure that there will be a future for her to do so.~
@859  = ~I suggest we start thinking of that now and set about finding this prophet so that we can get back to securing that future for us all. Let us ask at the inn, that is usually a good place to hear gossip of all sorts.~
@860  = ~If this prophet has come to Candlekeep, someone there will know of it, I am sure.~
@861  = ~What you sense is nothing more than your own evil demon! You who are evil in the darkest sense of the word, it is your own taint that you sense here!~
@862  = ~Your kind have no place here, you defile everything that you come in contact with!~
@863  = ~You are right demon, your kind hold no fear over me. I have vowed to rid this world of evil and creatures such as you, if I feared you I would not be able to fulfil that vow.~
@864  = ~Taffic, I see the misery mirrored in your eyes and it pains me to say this, but you have none but yourself to blame.~
@865  = ~(*Looking around to check that you are all ok*) Good, we all seem to be here.~
@866  = ~Let us take a few moments to steady our heads before we begin our ascent of the tower.~
@867  = ~I’m not sure I’ll never get used to you doing that Hrothgar, my senses are still reeling from the experience.~
@868  = ~I just love it when you do that Hrothgar...it’s so...so exhilarating!~
@869  = ~Wow! I’m definitely going to have to get me one of those gadgets Hrothgar!~
@870  = ~Perhaps we could try walking next time Hrothgar.~
@871  = ~I know what you mean, even after my many years experience of teleportation travel, I still find it a little unsettling in my head. Believe me, it is a sensation you get used to in time.~
@872  = ~It has even been said by some, that the euphoria experienced inside the vortex is highly addictive, brought on we think by the upset of chemicals in the brain as we are drawn into the energy that is the vortex.~
@873  = ~For this reason, we try to limit our use of the device. One day though, we hope to make the journey a little less... shall we say... addictive?~
@874  = ~Now, no more talk of vortexes, we still have much to do here.~
@875  = ~(*He turns his attention to the ruin in front of you*) Is it my imagination or does the fortress appear to be somewhat less foreboding than it did on our first visit?~
@876  = ~Nevertheless, imaginings or not, we must once again recommence our journey... make our way to Sheverash Tower and find Larrel. Let us hope the gods are with us and our ascent will not be so perilous this time.~
@877  = ~(*Laughing*) You too my friend. You are not the first to find teleportation through this device... exhilarating, I think is the word you used.~
@878  = ~In fact, it has even been said by some, that the euphoria experienced inside the vortex is highly addictive, brought on we think by the upset of chemicals in the brain as we are drawn into the energy that is the vortex.~
@879  = ~For this reason, we try to limit our use of the device. One day though, we hope to make the journey a little less... shall we say... exhilarating, a little less addictive?~
@880  = ~(*Laughing*) Walking is all fine and well my friend if time is in abundance. Unfortunately, my control over time is limited.~
@881  = ~When my presence was once again recognised in my own time, then the sequence of events that make up my life started to move on, and with it the urgency for us to find the old enemy before it finishes whatever diabolical plan it has for my people.~
@882  = ~Once again, teleportation was our quickest option. Believe me, it is a mode of travel that, in time, you soon get used to.~
@883  = ~Now, no more talk for we still have much to do here.~
@884  = ~Let me assure you Imoen, we arrived here at the time we should. Tilorn returned us to the present at exactly the same point in time we left, so you see, no time was lost, there was no delay in your rescue and there was no taking of the 'scenic route', as you so quaintly put it.~
@885  = ~This was how it was meant to be, there is no amount of playing with time that could have changed this. Truly, I am sorry for your loss, as I know it is great, but you must believe me, there was  nothing I could have done that would have changed the outcome of what has transpired here.~
@886  = ~We came as and when time necessitated it was to be... as we were meant to.~
@887  = ~You do not see, I came when I could, but as I have said, nothing could have changed what was going to happen, what did happen. It was meant to be... a part of a much, much bigger picture.~
@888  = ~As I said to <CHARNAME>, I knew you would be found, I knew you would soon be safely back with us. Just as it is now...~
@889  = ~No my dear Imoen, I care very much about your well being, as I do for all my companions.~
@890  = ~We have travelled great lands together, battled horrendous creatures, but destiny was already written and it cannot be rewritten, this terrible thing would have happened no matter what.~
@891  = ~Certain things must remain as they were intended to be, it is our best chance, our only chance of stemming the tide of the impending chaos.~
@892  = ~Imoen you are angry with me at something I had no control over. I have told you that you are important, and that I haven’t put you second to anything. If you feel that I came too late then there is no more I can say, except trust me. All is as it should be.~
@893  = ~(*Putting an arm around the distraught girl*) I am sorry for your pain, but I couldn’t change things, nor can I change them now, no matter how much I want to.~
@894  = ~I know you have the strength within you to win through Imoen, and never forget that we are here to help you as well as <CHARNAME>.~
@895  = ~Imoen...~
@896  = ~All is forgiven, my young friend. Grudges should not be held in a time when alliances are needed.~
@897  = ~I know that this must seem like a very dark time for you, but I don’t think Irenicus has taken all that was Imoen. I sense her spark was too bright for even him to extinguish.~
@898  = ~(*Rolls his eyes and smiles*) As I said, the spark, or should that be the rogue, is still very much alive and kicking within our Imoen.~
@899  = ~What is it my friend, another bad drea... yea gods, what sort of dream brings such agony to the face? (*He tries to rouse you*) Come my friend, waken and send this nightmare of yours back to the ether.~
@900  = ~Hrothgar I... I feel something... I... please my friend, I don’t know what it is I feel but I am losing my hold on it. You must step away from me... now my friend... NOW!~
@901  = ~Hrothgar... what is happening? This is no dream, I am awake and yet I am losing control of my senses. Help me, please!~
@902  = ~(*He looks sadly at you*) This is too soon, you are not strong enough <CHARNAME>, but still I can not aid you.~
@903  = ~(*Looking at you with relief in his eyes*) Praise be, you are yourself again. I feared you would be lost to us permanently. Come, it is imperative that we step up our search for Irenicus!~
@904  = ~I... what happened, did I hurt anyone? Yea gods Hrothgar, what does this mean, what have I become?~
@905  = ~Hrothgar, it was terrible! I could see you, see you all and I wanted to kill, to murder, the urge was too powerful for me to control... what is thing that I have become?~
@906  = ~The power... Hrothgar it was awesome, I have never before experienced so much energy, so much power! I must learn to control it, for if I had even half the power that creature  possessed then none would dare oppose me again... ever.~
@907  = ~(*Putting a comforting hand on your shoulder*) It is nothing for you to fear. You have had but a glimpse of what lies beneath, but whilst it is still weak its power can not influence you.~
@908  = ~You will have to choose soon enough and there is no one who can guide you when that time comes. Only you can look into your heart and see what is right for you, but when that choice presents itself I ask that you remember these words, *with power also comes responsibility*.~
@909  = ~Now come, the longer we tally the further our quarry moves away.~
@910  = ~(*His eyes bore into your own... you shiver. If you had a soul you would swear he were looking straight into it*) You have had but a glimpse of what lies beneath... it is still weak and yet I see it is able to influence you.~
@911  = ~(*Seeing the fear in the eyes of everyone*) There’s nothing to fear my friends... the beast has been banished and <CHARNAME> is once again <CHARNAME>.~
@912  = ~I am not even going to try and second guess this place, the only thing I can say for sure is that we are not safe here. I say we step up our search for an exit, we can deal with anything else as and when it comes along.~
@913  = ~Er... excuse me, in case you hadn’t noticed I am standing here and I still lead this group, so I’ll thank you not to speak for me!~
@914  = ~Hrothgar is right, we need to get out of here and fast, before Irenicus learns we are still alive. We don’t need him coming down here to finish Bodhi’s job himself.~
@915  = ~So what are we waiting for... Irenicus is in for one hell of a shock if he thinks he can get rid of us so easily. With or without a soul, this child of Bhaal is not one he should have messed with!~
@916  = ~I agree, this place is so heavily steeped in magic, who knows what it is doing to our heads. We need to find an exit... and fast!~
@917  = ~No one, least of all, me is disputing your leadership. All I am saying is some pretty weird things are going on around us and the sooner we leave this place, the sooner we can put a stop to it all. So, with your leave, let’s stop nattering and find that door!~
@918  = ~I think if Bodhi had gotten back to Irenicus he would have shown his face by now. I am thinking, hoping, that means he won’t be expecting us and we may still have the advantage of surprise over him...we need to bring him down before he opens that spell filled mouth of his. So let’s make the most of this opportunity and find that door.~
@919  = ~This place was built to hold those whose minds had been burnt-out by magic, so it is possible some of those minds have left their mark in its very walls. All the more  reason for us to find that door and leave here as quickly as possible, get back to normality... if there is such a thing as normality in your life <CHARNAME>.~
@920  = ~No, I believe there is but one such creature and it is linked to <CHARNAME> in some bizarre way. You Imoen, whereas we do need to restore your soul as quickly as possible in order to save you. You need not fear the beast taking you over.~
@921  = ~We are wasting time to try and second guess anything about this place. The only sure thing is that as long as we remain here, none of us are safe.~
@922  = ~I say we step up our search for an exit, we can deal with anything else as and when it comes along.~
@923  = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>? Do you need something?~
@924  = ~Hrothgar, could you please teleport us back to Athkatla?~
@925  = ~Nothing at the moment, but thank you.~
@926  = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.~
@927  = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@928  = ~Hrothgar, could you please teleport us to Candlkeep?~
@929  = ~Eurich, I didn't expect to see you in the long run... By the way, thank you for the flame thrower.~
@930  = ~Yes, I know, and I'll see to it. Any ideas on the fastest route there?~
@931  = ~Farewell, Eurich. Take care in your travels, my friend.~
@932  = ~Hrothgar, what was that all about? Who is that man that approached you and seems to know me? Another "Tilorn" type of your friend? And what's that "temporal actuator"?~
@933  = ~(*Eurich... The name and the man seem familar to you. But you cannot remember where and when did you meet.*) Hrothgar, is it possible that I have met this man before?~
@934  = ~(*Eurich... The name and the man seem familar to you. But you cannot remember where and when did you meet. You are deciding not to ask Hrothgar anything about this man and this wierd encounter, but making a mental note on that.*)~
@935  = ~(*Hrothgar abrupts you*) <CHARNAME>, I well understand your curiosity, but I cannot answer all these questions at the moment. You'll have all the answers in time, but for now you should know that Eurich is indeed another friend of mine and a very respectful man.~
@936  = ~(*Sigh*) Again a very evasive answer from you, Hrothgar.~
@937  = ~I don't think so, <CHARNAME>. As you heard, we must return to Kuldahar in the past and continue looking for the answers at any time when you consider it proper. Please bear this in mind when we discover another portal in our travels.~
@938  = ~<CHARNAME>, as you heard, we must return to Kuldahar in the past and continue looking for the answers at any time when you consider it proper. Please bear this in mind when we discover another portal in our travels.~
@939  = ~<CHARNAME>, you cannot ever have all the answers. This may affect the time continuity and destroy the ballance, and we have already discussed that.~
@940  = ~But at least every time I ask it, the question is refined.~
@941  = ~Anyway, as you heard, we must return to Kuldahar in the past and continue looking for the answers at any time when you consider it proper. Please bear this in mind when we discover another portal in our travels.~
@942  = ~By the horns of Silvanus! By what right do you bring us to this place? Why now of all times do you choose to renege on your promise of help Hrothgar?~
@943  = ~Your time and your people are dead to us, if you don’t wish to join them in their fate, I strongly suggest you return us and allow <CHARNAME> to reclaim that which has been stolen from <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@944  = ~I am not so sure this is a wise thing to be doing, but I will take my lead from you and do as you see fit.~
@945  = ~That was no creature conceived by nature! I can only surmise that it is a creature of the abyss and is somehow connected to <CHARNAME> through Bhaal’s blood. We can not condemn the child for the sins of the father, we can however remain wary should it return.~
@946  = ~I am of this time Hrothgar and perhaps understand more than anyone here why you need to return.~
@947  = ~What I can not understand is your readiness to so quickly abandon a trusted companion who has gone out of their way to help you, and whose very being is now in danger of being consumed by the beast within.~
@948  = ~Hrothgar has said you shouldn’t feel any effects whilst here Imoen, but just in case Dar will be watching over you, ready to catch you should you fall.~
@949  = ~I have never tried it but I am sure a resurrection spell works just as well on a person without a soul as it does on a person with their soul intact. Be assured I will always have such a spell memorised just for you.~
@950  = ~No one will be leaving Imoen in an icy grave, not whilst Dar is around.~
@951  = ~Whether or not this beast it is a thing to be feared is best answered by asking ourselves the question: why did the creature Bodhi retreat so swiftly? Could it be she sensed that she herself was outmatched and could not best the beast?~
@952  = ~It matters not to heros where evil rears its head. If as Hrothgar says there is evil hiding itself in the past and then to the past we heros must go to find it.~
@953  = ~There is no hidey hole that keeps evil safe from a ranger and his hamster. Mnsc will poke his righteous sword into the high places and Boo will gnash his teeth and chase it from the smallest of places.~
@954  = ~So evil beware, for now Minsc is on your tail!~
@955  = ~Fear not Melora, whilst you have a ranger and his hamster beside you, behind you and in front of you, neither bounty hunter nor any other hunter will dare touch even a hair of such a pretty head.~
@956  = ~You have Minsc who will stand guard in the daytimes and because Boo wakes up at the night times, he will stand guard whilst Minsc sleeps.~
@957  = ~Minsc will keep his eye on Imoen, he doesn’t want her to be falling into all this snow.~
@958  = ~She may catch new... newmonia I think Dynaheir called it one time when Minsc wouldn’t take off his wet clothes after he got wet jumping into the river.~
@959  = ~It was Boo who told Minsc he should jump into the water. Boo said he saw another miniature giant space hamster under the water and Minsc should jump in and save him.~
@960  = ~But he must have swum away or got frightened when Minsc made a big splash as he jumped in, because I looked under the water and on top of the water, but there was no sign of him anywhere.~
@961  = ~Oooh... you are a smart one Boo! You caught Minsc out there, but he’ll not jump in the river for that one again.~
@962  = ~(*Squeak*)~ [BOONEJ1]
@963  = ~This is great fun Hrothgar, first we were there and now *whoosh*, we are here!~
@964  = ~With such a trick, evil will not see us coming, we will surprise it... we will *whoosh* and jump out right in front of it’s nose. If it has a nose to whoosh up to, we really don’t know what this evil looks like do we, and Boo says not all evil have noses.~
@965  = ~It matters not to Minsc, nose or no nose, because when we do at last see evil’s face, it will not be evil’s nose that feels the righteous fury of Minsc’s boot heels!~
@966  = ~Minsc has seen the druids become animals of the forest, a bear or even a wolf, but this was no forest animal... this beast wore the face of evil, but now it wears the face of <CHARNAME>.~
@967  = ~Minsc does not feel that it is right to deliver a butt kicking to <CHARNAME>. What if the face of evil becomes the face of <CHARNAME> just as Minsc sent <PRO_HIMHER> to the abyss?~
@968  = ~Oooh... this is confusing, what does Boo say?~
@969  = ~(*Angrily*) This is Kuldahar? For pity’s sake, what manner of man are you Hrothgar, you have seen the nature of the beast that Irenicus has freed and yet you allow the past to dictate your path when you should consider the future?~
@970  = ~Our path is not for you to choose, so I beg you, if there is a shred of humanity in you, then return us... return us whilst we still have time to right the wrong that has been done in the future.~
@971  = ~I hope you know what you are doing <CHARNAME>. We have gone through so much together I would hate to see it end in a time where it hasn’t yet begun.~
@972  = ~	We all have our own personal demons deep within us, but thank the gods that is where they remain!~
@973  = ~We know whose blood it is that courses through <CHARNAME>, and now with <PRO_HISHER> soul torn away, Irenicus has left <PRO_HIMHER> powerless to deny the call of its taint.~
@974  = ~I say we move quickly to right this atrocity whilst the beast is still weak, for the longer we dally, the stronger it will become.~
@975  = ~I hope you know what you are doing <CHARNAME>. We have  gone through so much together I would hate to see it end in a time where it hasn’t yet begun.~
@976  = ~By the nine hells, what do you think you’re doing man! Send me back so’s I can fulfil my destiny or by the gods you’ll find yourself without a present or a future!~
@977  = ~Hmph, I wish a bounty hunter would take your head, it might wipe that self satisfied grin off your face, or at least silence that harpy tongue of yours for good!~
@978  = ~Don’t you be so cocky my arrogant harpy. Many a head has fallen to other than a bounty hunter.~
@979  = ~(*A glint comes to his eye*) Looks like you spoke too soon hafling. Tell me how secure does that head of yours feel now?~
@980  = ~Tut tut, a might tetchy aren’t we! No need to be getting yourself so fired up. I’m not the one you need to be running from.~
@981  = ~(*He walks away chortling to himself*) Mmm, maybe I should check the going price for that one, should have a risen quite a bit by the time we return.~
@982  = ~I suppose it may not be so bad. Could be I’ll find some artifact or such like to help me on my way to greatness.~
@983  = ~If such a thing lies hidden here in the past, it’ll save me the trouble in the  future of having to come all this way to dig through a hundred years of ice and snow to get at it.~
@984  = ~Now that’s the way to travel! No trekking over frozen, wet wasteland, not to mention not having to listen to you hafling, you and your endless wagging tongue, day in and day out.~
@985  = ~Haven’t I always said that hafling weren’t right in the head, her and her dumb prejudices!~
@986  = ~Next time we have a long trek ahead of us <CHARNAME>, remind me and it’ll be my pleasure to point her in the right direction, let her get on with it. Then we’ll see who’s head is screwed on properly and who’s isn’t.~
@987  = ~I reckon all our lives are in danger as long as we let that thing roam free. Who’s to say when next it’ll pop up, and maybe next time it’ll succeed in slaughtering us all! I say we take action before it does!~
@988  = ~Innocent... did it look innocent to you, to any of you? If you listen to the hafling, we’ll all be digging our own graves soon enough.~
@989  = ~(*Spluttering*) I always thought you insane gnome! You would do well to hold your tongue and not toss threats at one who appears to wield power that is way over your head. Not that it has any great distance to go to be over your head.~
@990  = ~Besides, I quite like it here, no bounty hunters trying to separate my own head from my shoulders.~
@991  = ~(*Chuckling*) Not a cat’s chance in hell of that happening gnome. Not whilst we remain here. (*She turns and swaggers away.*)~
@992  = ~(*Excitedly*) Kuldahar, the past, this is ace Hrothgar! You realise what this means, no bounty hunters looking to profit from my demise, no more looking over my shoulder every second. Heck no-one here has even heard of the name Melora Tenarien!~
@993  = ~I mean I am sorry about you losing your soul and all that <CHARNAME> but I’m sure you’ll get it back, as Hrothgar always says, "in time".~
@994  = ~(*She draws herself up to her full height and her fingers curl around the hilt of her sword*) A might more secure than yours will be if you don’t keep your mouth shut gnome!~
@995  = ~I really appreciate that Minsc, and will you thank Boo for me too. I know I shouldn’t let that runt of an excuse for a gnome get to me, but he reeks of magic and wizardry, a stench I can not abide.~
@996  = ~The gnome knows this and ‘tis the only reason he continues to walk under my nose. (*She sighs*) Ah well, the dream was good even if it was for a brief moment only. I suppose it’s back to the future, fraught as it is with danger, it’s where we belong.~
@997  = ~I hate it when you do that Hrothgar, when anyone does that! We’re lucky it turned out alright this time, we do appear to have gotten here in one piece, but how long before our luck runs out and we end up with our bits scattered all over Faerun?~
@998  = ~In future, if it’s all the same to you, I’d rather suffer the cold and wet than risk travel by means of some artifact powered by magic.~
@999  = ~Hmm... good point there gnome. I mean my not having to tolerate you and your oversized ego through what could have been a very long march was a plus, but only a minor plus let me say. I’d still prefer to travel under my own steam, the way the gods intended us to.~
@1000 = ~So speaks the great hero to be! You liver hearted, mangy cur... you have no idea whether the beast will even show itself again! We can’t be sure so I suggest we remain vigilant and maybe another innocent life won’t be lost.~
@1001 = ~There are too many in this world who think *it is better to strike first, ask questions after*, and all of them are just as liver hearted as this gnome here!~
@1002 = ~You want a hand to dig yours now gnome? Come, I’ll even help you into it when we’ve done digging!~
@1003 = ~We have no idea whether the beast will even show itself again! We can’t be sure so I suggest we refrain from doing something we may come to regret later. Instead, if we remain vigilant, maybe another innocent life needn’t be lost.~
@1004 = ~There are too many in this world who think *it is better to strike first, ask questions after*, and besides, we’d only be doing the sorcerer’s dirty work for him if we went down that road.~
@1005 = ~Damn fool hafling, only an imbecile would rejoice at being thrown back in time in order to save a world of uneducated peasants! What’s the use of progress if we use it to return ourselves to the dark ages!~
@1006 = ~(*There should be penalties levied on those guilty of indiscriminate breeding, might put a stop to these accidents that birth imbeciles.*)~
@1007 = ~As for you paladin, you have the gall to presume to move MY person, to this frozen lump of orc dung you call home without prior permission from ME!~
@1008 = ~ME, you know, Edwin Odesseiron, the ME to whom this magnificent, personification of male perfection belongs, and which, for some unfathomable reason, your misplaced brain seems to thinks it is yours to do with as you please!~
@1009 = ~Return me to my own time or it’ll be my pleasure to show you that you’re not the only one capable of moving bodies. Only difference is, I’ll send yours somewhere a darn sight warmer than this frozen hole you’ve brought me to!!~
@1010 = ~What the?! Paladin, you’d best start explaining fast why you have the gall to presume to move MY person, to this frozen lump of orc dung you call home without prior permission from ME!~
@1011 = ~Return me to my own time or it’ll be my pleasure to show you that you’re not the only one capable of moving bodies. Only difference is, I’ll send yours somewhere a darn sight warmer than this frozen hole you’ve brought me to!~
@1012 = ~(*Murmurs to himself*) (*Once again I can see this is going to need my expertise to oversee these imbeciles, and to make sure they do nothing to disrupt the lineage of the noble Odesseiron family.*)~
@1013 = ~(*Not that I imagine any Odesseirons hailing from these backwaters, still one can not take chances with simpletons loose in the past.*)~
@1014 = ~Ho, my friend, you have always walked a fine line through this world of ours but I fear you may have just crossed it.~
@1015 = ~You may meddle and play around with time but you can not play around with people’s lives or indeed their futures.~
@1016 = ~I am an old paladin and I came to my place in the scheme of things many years ago, but these young people still have far to go. You had no right bringing them here when so much needs reconciling in their own time.~
@1017 = ~If it is their choice then I must insist you return them immediately, but if it is Torm’s will, I will remain and together we will show evil that two men who stand with their god on their side are not to be trifled with.~
@1018 = ~It is true, I have heard whispers of such a brotherhood among those of my own order, but when questioned, Prelate Wesselan  always dismissed them as mere myths, nothing more than a bard’s imaginations and yet, his eye would take on a look that revealed more than he did.~
@1019 = ~I always felt there was something more than myth and imagination, but he would not say more.~
@1020 = ~Now what t’blazes ‘ave yer gone an’done paladin! Yer better be telling a good story as t’why yer yanked us back here if yer don’t wanta feel me axe a slitting yer gizzard.~
@1021 = ~Won’t hurt fer  m’ears to hear the jingle of gold whilst yer be doing yer telling neither.~
@1022 = ~(*Sidling up to the elf*) Quit yer whinging elf. After all, if this don’t put some hair on that chest of yers... or what passes for yer chest... yer can always snuggle up to Korgan here, he ‘as more than enough t’keep the both of us warm.~
@1023 = ~Just yer remember elfie, ‘t’aint an open offer I be giving yer here. A dwarf aint known fer ‘is patience yer know and ‘t’aint gonna get no warmer here.~
@1024 = ~That’s be a mighty useful gadget that yer got yerself paladin, could get a dwarf outa many a scrape. ‘Nother of yer guild’s workings yer don’t want others getting ther hands on I’m betting.~
@1025 = ~(*Still, if yer were to pop yer clogs, I reckon ‘twould only be fair fer who found yer first to sort yer stuff.*)~
@1026 = ~	There aint a hell beast Korgan be afeared of. If the beastie dare rear its ugly head agin, it’ll find its brains splattered and me axe sticking out of em!~
@1027 = ~What trickery is this Hrothgar?! Do you deny that you dabble in the black arts of magic in order to bring us to this place?~
@1028 = ~I demand answers from you now and believe me, I will not balk from using any means necessary to get satisfaction!~
@1029 = ~I should have expected no less of you <CHARNAME>. Hrothgar cannot be blamed for wanting to save his people and your insistence to help him makes me ashamed of my angry words.~
@1030 = ~Please understand, my only concern is that a good and beautiful soul may be lost to the world forever if we do not act swiftly to retrieve it.~
@1031 = ~Forget my words and let us continue to Dorn’s Deep as is your wish. (*He turns away before you can answer him, leaving you, not for the first time, with unspoken thoughts whirling around inside your head.*)~
@1032 = ~(*Moans*) Yea gods no!! How many more family and friends will I be forced to murder solely because they have touched my life? Damn this curse, and damn me for caring!~
@1033 = ~This is not the way to enlist aid Hrothgar, whisking us away without a moments notice. You know that Mazzy Fenton is always ready to fight for those unable to stand for themselves!~
@1034 = ~It matters not to me whether the fight takes me to the past or to the moon, where ever the weak need a strong arm then I will lend them mine.~
@1035 = ~I will stay and trust Arvoreen to guide me true, but if it is in your power then you must allow the others to return if it is their wish. You are a good man Hrothgar and you know in your heart that what I say is right.~
@1036 = ~This isn’t quite how I envisioned helping the needy, but I suppose there are people in the past just as needy as those of the future.~
@1037 = ~Maybe even more because I remember auntie saying that the peasants of today should be grateful they aren’t living in the days gone by, because if they were, then they’d know what real hardship means.~
@1038 = ~"The peasants of today, live in luxury, compared to conditions back then", she’d say. I never did understand her. In all my visits to the poor, luxury was the last thing I found.~
@1039 = ~Maybe being here in the past I will at last gain some understand to her words.~
@1040 = ~(*Angrily*) I must protest most profusely at you insensitivity in bringing us here Hrothgar! Is it not clear to you the distress my lady is being forced to endure?~
@1041 = ~Have you not seen for yourself the nature of the beast that threatens to consume and destroy all that is beautiful and good in this woman who stands beside me?~
@1042 = ~I fear for what she may lose, for what we both may lose if she is forced to remain in this time. I will not stand by idly and watch my love destroyed. I must insist on you returning us both from whence we have just come!~
@1043 = ~This is not my fight! If the gods had willed that I should fight for you Hrothgar then I would have been born of your time, not whisked through some portal on your whim!~
@1044 = ~I must insist you return me immediately, there are battles enough in the future to fight, I am not about to risk my life fighting for those, who in reality, are already dead and buried!~
@1045 = ~As my lady wishes. It was your goodness as much as your beauty that first drew me to you.~
@1046 = ~Once again you show what a noble heart beats within your breast, and as much as it tortures my own heart to see you putting others before your own salvation, I swear to you my lady, I will not sleep nor will I leave your side, not whilst the beast still rages within.~
@1047 = ~This may not be my fight but if you intend to see it through, never let it be said that Anomen Delryn shirked in his duty and allowed evil to roam free despoiling all in its path.~
@1048 = ~Lead on I say, lead on to this dwarven hold and let us rid it of the evil that you speak of once and for all!~
@1049 = ~(*Her face pale and tinged blue from the coldness of the air around her*) Hrothgar please, I must ask that you send me home.~
@1050 = ~Already I begin to feel the cold seeping through my skin. Avariel are not used to such conditions and I fear I do not have the constitution necessary to survive such a cold, inhospitable place!~
@1051 = ~Please Hrothgar, I beg of you, I don’t want to die so far from my home.~
@1052 = ~Go away you disgusting creature I’d rather let the cold take me then have you come anywhere near me! (*She backs away from him.*)~
@1053 = ~(*Speaking quietly*) Then I will trust in Baervan to watch over me. With his guidance, I will do what I can to help and hope that I do not become a burden to you all.~
@1054 = ~You sure put the blight among the turnips this time Hrothgar.~
@1055 = ~Great grandpappy of cousin Jan the third did that once when he brought the pesky beetles home in his trunk after being away on one of his sea faring adventures. Reckons some foreigner or other told him they were the fastest way to fertilise his crops.~
@1056 = ~How he rid the turnip fields of the pests is another story and I don’t reckon anyone is in a mind to hear it just now.~
@1057 = ~However, cousin Jan the third’s great grandpappy had to do some quick thinking and smart talking before the other Jansen’s set about him, and it seems to Jan here that you need to be doing some of that smart talking yourself my friend.~
@1058 = ~	Ah, I know this one, a story told me by second cousin thrice removed. Went by the name of... now what was his name? Robby L... that’s it Robby Luis something, liked to be called RL.~
@1059 = ~Said he had an uncle, a doctor who had concocted a potion which would allow him to change between gnome and beast.  Mmm... strangest thing, I’m darned if I can recall this doctor’s name at this minute.~
@1060 = ~Mal'ai kivvilen! Dos izin natha jaluk ulu lead l' i'dol lu' t'yin bemoan vel'klar ukt brainless shar plynnen dos!~
@1061 = ~You presume to make decisions for us? Such arrogance in a male should never be tolerated! I demand that he be punished severely for allowing his head to rise above his station!~
@1062 = ~Let his head be made to sit on the ground, so that it may never rise so high again!~
@1063 = ~No, this can not be, not now Yoshimo! We have only just found each, only just started out on our future together and now we are thrown back into the past.~
@1064 = ~All that we have fought through, all that we have shared, it has not yet happened. How... how can we make a future based on what is still so far away? Please, we must go back Yoshimo, we must!~
@1065 = ~(*Leaning into his embrace*) I hope you are right Yoshimo. Not for one second did I suspect that when I left Kara Tur,  Kachiko the huntress would become Kachiko the lover of her prey.~
@1066 = ~It has been a long and arduous journey my ignoble bounty hunter, but it is not one I will ever regret making.~
@1067 = ~(*Anxiously*) Yoshimo?~
@1068 = ~The air Yoshimo, it was all around me, pulling at me, drawing me further and further into it! Then, for a moment, I lost sight of you, I couldn’t hear you, I was alone and afraid.~
@1069 = ~It reminded me of the island, of how you came to rescue me. Only it was different, I couldn’t see you, couldn’t hear you... I... I thought I was lost again.~
@1070 = ~Oh Yoshimo... (*Before she has the chance to finish speaking, he covers her mouth with his own and, forgetting what it was she wanted to say, she yields to the warmth of his kiss.*)~
@1071 = ~(*Moving closer to Yoshimo she puts both her arms around him*) Is this close enough my gallant Samurai? Know that Yoshimo needs no excuse to keep Kachiko close to his side. There is no place she would rather be.~
@1072 = ~(*Gently pulling the frightened girl into his arms, he attempts to calm her with a kiss*) Shush... my turtle dove.~
@1073 = ~Tell your Yoshimo this, do you feel any differently towards him then you did before we stepped through the portal? Has you heart suddenly grown indifferent to his kisses?~
@1074 = ~I know that Yoshimo’s love for the lovely Katchiko still burns as strongly in his heart. It is strange, we are in a time before our birth and yet all remains the same.~
@1075 = ~It is as though all that we have has remained with us, as though even time can not erase love once it enters the heart. I sense all will be well with us my beautiful girl.~
@1076 = ~(*Kissing the top of her head*) Nor will I my sweet... nor will I. (*Then looking over the top of her head, he directs his next words at Hrothgar*) I will not see my Kachiko so distraught Hrothgar.~
@1077 = ~If this time of yours brings grief to her heart then you have the word of Yoshimo the bounty hunter that you will not live long enough to regret ever stepping through that portal of yours.~
@1078 = ~(*Slipping his hand into hers*) I am here Kachiko, right beside you.~
@1079 = ~Hush now my turtle dove. Surely you know that even if all the wizards in Faerun, or indeed the world were to combine their powers, they still wouldn’t be able to conjure a force strong enough to keep me from your side.~
@1080 = ~(*Pulling the anxious Kachiko to him*) Here, let your Yoshimo kiss away all those silly fears of yours.~
@1081 = ~This isn’t good! Kachiko, if we are to continue with this group then I must insist you stay close to me... at least until we know what it is we face here.~
@1082 = ~You are far too precious my turtle dove to risk that beast taking us unawares again. Besides, Yoshimo swore to Kachiko’s family that he would keep their cherished daughter safe and as long as I draw breath, safe she will be.~
@1083 = ~So my hawk, you have flown far this time and like the hawk, you have carried your reluctant prey with you back to your nest, but to feed to who or what I wonder?~
@1084 = ~Ah ha, there is never smoke without fire my friend, and many a bard’s tale has its roots firmly fixed in fact and not fiction.~
@1085 = ~You my hawk, along with your kin, have flown high for eons, just out of the sight of a man’s eye, but the eye of Haer’Dalis caught sight of your kind when you were but a fledgling, and learned to recognise your nature.~
@1086 = ~It was only a matter of time before the hawk would have need to leave the cloak of the clouds and reveal his true feathers.~
@1087 = ~Yeah well, flux or no flux, what the bleeding hell is a flux anyway? What the heck, you’re right about time running out paladin? Only it’s not your people’s time you sense slipping away but your own!~
@1088 = ~(*Then drawing her sword she continues*) If you don’t want to be standing on the outside as your insides start falling to the outside, then you’d better explain what we’re doing here and in words we can all understand.~
@1089 = ~(*Looking very white faced and sick*) Nothing to fear, you saw what that creature was! You forget, I am also without my soul, is that the fate that awaits me too Hrothgar... condemned live forever as a mindless, blood crazed monster... is it?~
@1090 = ~I sure as hell hope that is true Hrothgar! It was so... so ugly... so deformed. Eeew, I doubt even a mother could love a face such as that! Besides, I don’t fancy going through the rest of my life trapped in that hideous body!~
