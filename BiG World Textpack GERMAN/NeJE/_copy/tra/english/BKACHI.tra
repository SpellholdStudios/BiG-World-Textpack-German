@0    = ~Ouch! Looks like you’ve spent some time for improving your fighting skills...~
@1    = ~You should have kept your eyes on the weapons Yoshimo Hashimoto, not on my... me. Then you would have fared better.~ [KACHIL01]
@2    = ~Killing you was just a chore before, a vow to fulfill; I feel that it can become a pleasurable exploit in the very near future. Let us restart, Dragon tongue.~ [KACHIL11]
@3    = ~Naoko and you were friends... It is so strange. The brother I adored and thought I knew so well had such a secret!~ [KACHIL02]
@4    = ~You should not have hid from me!~
@5    = ~I have been pondering on something for a while, Yoshimo. Naoko, he died very young, only 16... You were of the same age were you not? It must have been horrible for you... how did you survive all of that?~ [KACHIL03]
@6    = ~Yoshimo, I see that the memory still hurts you... You do not have to tell if you do not want to, I understand.~
@7    = ~No, no. I am not appalled... It’s just that when you have spoken of Naoko I glimpsed the honorable noble you had been...~ [KACHIL13]
@8    = ~Yoshimo, I would like to continue our last conversation...~
@9    = ~The world does not consist of Hashimoto and Nakanishi, Yoshimo. I see now how high the walls of my house were; how small was our existence and how petty was our honor! But I witnessed true honorable deeds in the wide world and I am sure you had also.~ [KACHIL04]
@10   = ~I saw it in a destitute rogue also...~ [KACHIL14]
@11   = ~Yoshimo, I MUST know, I do not believe...~
@12   = ~Yoshimo, if you would...if you would please sit with me for a moment... I am really scared of what you’ve told me before...~
@13   = ~Thank you, Yoshimo. I was cold. Do you still keep an eye on me?~ [KACHIL05]
@14   = ~You... you were joking! All those talks about curses? And I almost believed you, Dragon Tongue!~ [KACHIL15]
@15   = ~Was the poem written for you? My opinion is all that matters and I LOVE it!~ [KACHIB11]
@16   = ~Stop it, stop it! You wasted three times more words already and said less than my Yoshimo! And why do I have a feeling that I have heard something similar before?~
@17   = ~Tie it is, <CHARNAME>.~
@18   = ~Anomen! Please, leave him to his contemplation! Anomen!~ [KACHIB01]
@19   = ~You look ever so grim, Valygar. What you need is a good woman in your life. Have you ever loved Valygar?~
@20   = ~So it was an unhappy experience? Who was she?~
@21   = ~You cannot say that about all women, Valygar! I think the problem is yourself...~
@22   = ~I am sorry to hear that, Valygar. I think there is more to you than your family name and a hunting cabin... I hope you will be pleasantly surprised one day...~
@23   = ~Minsc, what are you looking for? Be careful with those potion bottles! Do you need a potion of healing or something? Let me help you...~ [KACHIB04]
@24   = ~Potion of Genius?~ [KACHIB14]
@25   = ~Well, it’s sort of true...~
@26   = ~Boo is one of a kind... I never knew hamsters could be that intelligent...~
@27   = ~(*smiles*) I do not know Minsc... may be you needed a potion of healing?~
@28   = ~Nalia, your dress! I cannot take my eyes away from your dress! It’s simply wonderful! I feel like such a tasteless slob near you...~ [KACHIB05]
@29   = ~Nalia, I see no harm in wearing a beautiful dress...~
@30   = ~Viconia, you are making me uncomfortable, staring at me like that...~ [KACHIB06]
@31   = ~Subservient? What are you talking about?~
@32   = ~You are talking about singsong girls, Viconia? Those are strange beings. They sing in brothels, yet dream of marriage. Some, however, gain true power through their lovers... The famous courtesan, Nita Chan Shi, was a concubine of Emperor Tsao Shou Chin, and she effectively ruled the Empire for 15 years. Those were prosperous and peaceful times.~ [KACHIB16]
@33   = ~No, Viconia, I have no use for power. I come from Kozakura, and we are not interested in the games of the Emperors and their courtiers. We have our own traditions. Nakanishi was never one to restrict females of the house. My grandfather trained me, though I am a girl. My mother is the most respected woman in Kozakura and my father values her advice. I do not need a lover to enhance my status.~
@34   = ~(*smiles*) I do not doubt it, Viconia.~ [KACHIB26]
@35   = ~So how is Haer’Dalis doing today?~ [KACHIB08]
@36   = ~(*laughs*) Did you just come up with this one, or is it from a play you were rehearsing?~ [KACHIB18]
@37   = ~I always thought that the purpose of any bard is to share his tale with as many people as possible, Haer’Dalis. I would not dare to steal your performance from the public...~ [KACHIB28]
@38   = ~Let me help you, Keldorn... Here we go, I fixed that torn seam on your shirt...  It’s as good as new now. That was quite a battle, was it not?~ [KACHIB09]
@39   = ~That sounds like a proper thing to do... What delays you?~
@40   = ~I am afraid there will never be less evil in the world, Keldorn. And if Torm minds you taking care of your family, there are other gods, more forgiving...~
@41   = ~In Kara-Tur, we believe that Eight Million Gods populate the Universe. If one frowns on you, another might smile. In his infinite wisdom, the Celestial Emperor has many Immortal helpers and you must talk to the right Immortal to bless your choices. In our land girls will pray in the Immortal Ai Ch’ing temple for rich husbands, then they will burn candles to Kwan Ying.~ [KACHIB19]
@42   = ~So that these good husbands will be handsome as well!~ [KACHIB29]
@43   = ~But at least you smiled!~
@44   = ~Aerie, are you crying?~ [KACHIB1A]
@45   = ~You miss them, do you not? Do not be embarrassed; I can understand your sorrow. I cannot imagine that I would never see my family or my native land again.~ [KACHIB2A]
@46   = ~I am afraid I would never know Aerie. But you do and I envy you.~
@47   = ~Aerie, I know how much grief there was in your life, but you went through it without loosing your faith in goodness. There is strength in you Aerie, and I respect it. If only you can start respecting yourself and trust in yourself! Please, stop tormenting and victimizing yourself...~
@48   = ~Jaheira, it’s not necessary to scrutinize me like that. I had done nothing wrong.~ [KACHIB0J]
@49   = ~I believe, that I was wrong about Yoshimo... I am getting to know him better and better every day and I... Has it ever happened to you? When you think badly of a person, then you talk to him and suddenly you realize that he is wonderful?~ [KACHIB1J]
@50   = ~Blush?  (*laughs*) No, no, Jaheira, why would I blush?~
@51   = ~Jaheira!~
@52   = ~Nothing! It’s nothing!~
@53   = ~If you only knew how irritating your attitude is...~ [KACHIB0E]
@54   = ~Or what?~
@55   = ~Try me Edwin! But I hope that you have another arrangement with the evil priest who resurrected you after your last untimely and violent death!~ [KACHIB1E]
@56   = ~Calm down, all of you! We have enough enemies without starting to fight among ourselves!~
@57   = ~Edwin, to be honest, you are wearing on my nerves also. I think we’d better part ways.~
@58   = ~Speaking about violent death, Edwin, I killed you once and I shall do so again!~
@59   = ~Imoen, I have not had the chance before, but I must tell you that I am glad we got you out of this terrible Asylum.~ [KACHIB0I]
@60   = ~I... know... My relatives invoked a strange state of ’undeath’ on me and I faced many torments before <CHARNAME> and Yoshimo came looking for me... But I am healing now. I wish you would start healing too.~
@61   = ~As you wish.~
@62   = ~I cannot help but wonder how this indomitable spirit could have come from such a sleepy place as Trademeet...~ [KACHIB1M]
@63   = ~Still, there had to be more than a fascination with a bard’s tale to make a halfing to leave comfort of her home, was there not?~
@64   = ~Hmm, why do I find that feeling vaguely familiar...~
@65   = ~Mazzy, you are truly a wonder! I am proud to name you among my friends. Mayhaps, when we complete our mission for <CHARNAME> we can journey together for a while?~
@66   = ~(*gives Valygar a push with her elbow, then whispers*) Squire? That’s what she calls it? She is head over heels into you, ranger... I’d bet Yoshimo’s katana against...~
@67   = ~(*Kachiko laughs uncontrollably. Valygar gets up and walks away. Mazzy stares at Kachiko in surprise.*)~
@68   = ~Taking notes, Jan?~ [KACHIB15]
@69   = ~Jan, we do not even know were the Island is! How are you going to bring the tourists there?~ [KACHIB25]
@70   = ~How many Kara-Turian families have you seen in Athkatla?~
@71   = ~Yes.~
@72   = ~Yes you did. Sorry, Jan, I absolutely have to talk to <CHARNAME> right away.~
@73   = ~Yoshimo, I know it’s painful for you to talk about this but how did Irenicus manage to get his evil hold over you?~ [KACHIL07]
@74   = ~What are you talking about? I asked you how did Irenicus get his evil hold over you?~
@75   = ~How awful!~
@76   = ~I do not know, Yoshimo. I love you so much and it hurts me to think that you had been seduced by the promises of evil...~ [KACHIL17]
@77   = ~Yes, it was. I am a bad singer, but the song came to my mind and I could not chase it away. You know how it happens? The same tune playing in your head over and over again?~
@78   = ~Love, naturally.~
@79   = ~I do not think I am too young to love. And you are definitely not too old. You cannot be more than thirty, Valygar.~
@80   = ~But why?~
@81   = ~I am a mage myself, Valygar. Do not you exaggerate a bit? Searching for knowledge is not a bad thing.~
@82   = ~No secrets, ranger. I am in love and I dare to hope that I am loved in return. I am happy, Valygar.~
@83   = ~Valygar, I am not sure of what you except me to say. No advice is good to a loving heart. You are a daring man in battle, why do you not try the same approach in the gentler matters?~
@84   = ~Then you know well what you are doing?~
@85   = ~Yes?~
@86   = ~But I am. May be I shall jump off the cliff?~
@87   = ~(*laughs*) You are so nice, Yoshimo. May be we shall try it one day.~
@88   = ~The world is a small place for those who travel, Sime. I know people for whom their house is an entire world.~
@89   = ~The mind has no boundaries, Sime. A philosopher may never leave his straw mat but his mind will travel the highest mountains and the deepest gorges and see the things clearer than the one who has climbed to the top.~
@90   = ~I have four brothers and a sister.~
@91   = ~It is a joy to have relations, yes. Your father does not have any other children?~
@92   = ~You sound bitter, Sime.~
@93   = ~And you do not believe so?~
@94   = ~Dar, I would just like to say how well you are adapting to your new life in a strange time.~
@95   = ~My life in Kara Tur ill prepared me for what I would find in this part of the world. Of course I expected to experience a cultural difference, but you Dar, you had to except a change in time. Did it not unnerve you a little?~
@96   = ~No Dar, it is not so much your choice of companions but more who you are. You are showing people a side of you that they could never imagine exists. You escaped the cruel death dealt to so many with your heritage at birth. All things that are have a reason to be. Fate intervened at your birth because you have a reason to be, never ever lose sight of that Dar!~
@97   = ~I feel certain that you will hear a lot more such words in your future Dar. It is easy to see that you have a good heart.~
@98   = ~Leina your music is very beautiful, but why do you sing so often of sadness when your voice is so much more suited to the songs of joy and love?~
@99   = ~Oh Leina! You are too young to have such a hard heart! Do you wish to tell me what has turned your heart to stone?~
@100  = ~I am sorry Leina, I should not have asked. It is plain to see the scars that you still carry are also in your music, but you should not let the actions of one man deny you the warmth and passion that real love brings. That way only leads to bitterness and a life of loneliness.~
@101  = ~As you please Leina, but I truly hope that someday you will feel the joy of love once again, with a man that will not abuse all that you have to give.~
@102  = ~(*Laughing*) I have to say  Yoshimo, that is the first time I have ever had a dance partner stand still while I danced around him. I thought you were going to surprise me with all that you had learnt.~
@103  = ~(*A gleam comes to her eye*) I too have learnt a lot in your absence Yoshimo.~
@104  = ~Have you learnt to dance at last Yoshimo? I remember watching you and that brother of mine, practising so’s you could impress the girls...  you think I didn’t notice? How I pitied those poor girls toes should they ever have the misfortune to dance with either of you.~
@105  = ~I will dance with you Yoshimo, if only to see what you have learnt, but I will not be dancing bare foot.~
@106  = ~Yoshimo, just name a large object. You do know one don’t you. A ship Leina.~
@107  = ~Yoshimo, show your manners! Guess something small like a sock, which I will put in your mouth if you can’t answer sensibly!~
@108  = ~Yoshimo, I am not even going to ask how it is you can get a man comfortably into a sack. Umm, this is not as easy as I first thought... could it perhaps be a barrel Leina?~
@109  = ~Shh Yoshimo, I am sure <CHARNAME> is about to tell us... aren’t you, <CHARNAME>?~
@110  = ~Oh enough with your horse play! Leina always wants a hot bath let’s get the jump on her first this time. What say you?~
@111  = ~Sssssh. Now listen Leina always wants a bath after a battle and she hasn’t said anything yet so let’s do it first.~
@112  = ~Hey now, listen Leina is always the first to want a bath after a stinkin’ battle so let’s ask her first for a fluffy towel. What say you?~
@113  = ~(*Smiling secretly*) An idea, now I wonder, who is going to fall foul of this idea of yours, <CHARNAME>?~
@114  = ~You have no need to understand Yoshimo, as I am sure <CHARNAME> is about to explain. Aren’t you, <CHARNAME>?~
@115  = ~(*Smiling secretly*) I suspect a certain young lady is about to discover what this idea of yours is. Am I not right, <CHARNAME>?~
@116  = ~I stand with Yoshimo on this! We will both watch that Leina is not upset by your plan, <CHARNAME>!~
@117  = ~(*Sternly*) I have the greatest respect for Leina, I will be watching that you do not upset her, <CHARNAME>, in any way!~
@118  = ~So the people of this land are not so far from my own. My brother would have liked you, <CHARNAME>.~
