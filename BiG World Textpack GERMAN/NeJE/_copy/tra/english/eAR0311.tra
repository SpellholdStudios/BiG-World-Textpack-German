@0    = ~Chapter 3 Throughout my time in Athkatla and my adventures in and around the city, I have seen hints of some great struggle between the Shadow Thieves and some other source... a guild filled with vampires and perhaps even greater evils. I have decided to invest in none of them, and this is by far preferable to receiving 'help' from either vampires or thieves. I have assassinated Gaelan Bayle and obtained a key from the lair of the Shadowmaster of the Shadow Thieves, who controls the entirety of this powerful organization: Aran Linvail. As ominous as that may sound, I have now little other choice but to plan an assault on Aran's lair to find any clue in my search for Irenicus.~
