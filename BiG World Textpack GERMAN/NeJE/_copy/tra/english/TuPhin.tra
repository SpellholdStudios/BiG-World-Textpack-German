@0    = ~More students wanting to prove themselves. This has been one of the busiest terms we have had in a long time. Still it is good to see the increase in the swing to specialist magic. Please I am Phineas and your name is? You are obviously one of my students but I am not very good at putting names to faces out of the classroom.~
@1    = ~Hello I am <CHARNAME> you sound busy Phineas. Is this a bad time for me to present myself for the ability tests?~
@2    = ~I am <CHARNAME>,  a student of yours and as you so rightly said Phineas, here to prove myself. What must I do.~
@3    = ~Well met Phineas. <CHARNAME> is my name and I believe testing is your game?~
@4    = ~I am <CHARNAME>. What does it matter whether you remember my face or not? We are here to test my magical prowess, not your memory.~
@5    = ~Well met Phineas I am <CHARNAME>, however it is not myself who seeks to be tested today.~
@6    = ~Not too busy to accommodate another potential abjurer. A couple of simple tasks for you to do and a pass certificate will be yours. So, you ready for me to explain how this goes? <CHARNAME>?~
@7    = ~I’m all ears.~
@8    = ~That’s what I am here for, start explaining.~
@9    = ~Yes and I am eager to begin.~
@10   = ~Well, I can not do anything until you do, now can I? So you best start talking.~
@11   = ~Good, that’s what I like to see. It is refreshing to see such dedication in a student. I will explain what is required if you are ready <CHARNAME>?~
@12   = ~(*Smiles*) It is but what a quaint way of asking <CHARNAME>. You sound very confident in yourself, not a failing on your part I hasten to add. In fact it’s good to see. Now are you ready to hear what simple tasks I have set for today?~
@13   = ~You would do well to leave your impudence at home if you wish to gain the respect and the help of the tutors here <CHARNAME>. Now, let’s forget this bad start and set about your reason for being here. Are you ready to listen to what I have to say?~
@14   = ~Whatever, just tell me what needs doing.~
@15   = ~I am not here for a lecture on etiquette Phineas. My attitude has nothing to do with my standing as a mage, but yes I am listening to you.~
@16   = ~You are an abjurer so it is obvious that these tests of mine are going to test your ability as an abjurer and also to show me that you pose no danger to those around you when you use your magic. The tasks are compiled to give me an idea of what you can do in two areas of an abjurer’s expertise.~
@17   = ~The first test will be for you to protect yourself from spells that I will be casting at you. I will not make it easy by telling you the level of these spells but I will tell you that I will cast three in total. The second test will give you the opportunity to break down my own defence. Are we set to begin <CHARNAME>?~
@18   = ~I am, Phineas.~
@19   = ~No, I have the spells but not memorised Phineas.~
@20   = ~I do not have the required spells in my spell book.~
@21   = ~Nalia is going to test her abilities.~
@22   = ~Aerie is prepared to be assessed.~
@23   = ~Kachiko is ready.~
@24   = ~Taffic may be small but he believes himself more than capable.~
@25   = ~Jan, imagine how funny it will be when your cousin Willy falls off his chair after he learns that you have passed your exam at Halruaa’s Academy of Magic.~
@26   = ~Edwin, I wouldn’t normally bother you... what with you being above this Halruaa and its mages, but as the only mage in the group, please I could really do with your help here. I realize that this silly exam is an insult to your intelligence, but if you could see your way clear to do this for me, the trinkets and new spells we gain if you pass will more than compensate for the inconvenience.~
@27   = ~That’s hardly a challenge and certainly not worth wasting my time on. I am out of here, farewell Phineas.~
@28   = ~Perhaps this is not a good time for me after all. Maybe some other time Phineas.~
@29   = ~Exellent! In your own time begin your casting.~
@30   = ~(*Rolls his eyes*) What is it about the students of today? In my days as a student I would not have been allowed to take any test if I had turned up unprepared, but now we are instructed to give the students a choice of scrolls. How that teaches them to set up their spells to cover any eventuality is beyond me.~
@31   = ~You disappoint me, student, here I was me thinking your keenness was an indication that you were prepared. I propose that you leave now and come back when you are prepared.~
@32   = ~(*Rolls his eyes*) What are we teaching our students today I ask myself, or is it they are just not listening? The tasks I have just set you, student, are doable by any number of abjuration spells and yet you say you don’t have any of them.~
@33   = ~Do you disregard my abilities solely because I do not have the spells required for this test of yours?~
@34   = ~I might not have what you call *any number* of abjuration  spells, but I am an Abjurer, and as such should be given the chance to prove myself!~
@35   = ~I am more than capable as an Abjurer to pass your tests, Phineas, if only you will give me the opportunity.~
@36   = ~Please, Phineas, I can pass your test if only will give me the chance.~
@37   = ~(*Rolls his eyes*) What are we teaching our students today I ask myself, or is it they are just not listening? The tasks I have just set you, student, are doable by any number of abjuration spells and yet you say you don’t have any of them. I suggest you come back when you are ready to prove yourself deserving of the name Abjurer! Farewell.~
@38   = ~My commitment to Halruaa will take me away for a time, how long or if I will return I do not know, so unless you take the tests today I can not say when anyone will next be available to set them. Think it over <CHARNAME>.~
@39   = ~Farewell, Phineas.~
@40   = ~Hold Phineas, I have changed my mind. Maybe time is not as pressing as I first thought, come let us begin.~
@41   = ~As a student, your attitude surprises me. You do know of course that you will not be allowed to graduate if you do not pass all the tests set. So there is more to consider here than whether they are a challenge or not, but I will not waste anymore of that precious time you speak of. Farewell <CHARNAME>.~
@42   = ~Circumstances being as they are, you decision to reconsider is the right one <CHARNAME>. You know the tasks, are you and your spells readied?~
@43   = ~I have, Phineas.~
@44   = ~I have the spells, Phineas, but I have not had the opportunity to memorise them.~
@45   = ~Still, it is not my place to question and you will lose you some marks because of it <CHARNAME>. You may pick one scroll for each task make your mind up quickly.~
@46   = ~Spell Immunity.~
@47   = ~Globe of Invulnerability.~
@48   = ~Protection From Magic Energy.~
@49   = ~Spell Deflection.~
@50   = ~Spell Shield.~
@51   = ~You may choose one for the second task.~
@52   = ~Spell Thrust.~
@53   = ~Secret Word.~
@54   = ~Breach.~
@55   = ~Pierce Magic.~
@56   = ~Ruby Ray of Reversal.~
@57   = ~Now let us see if you have made a wise choice <CHARNAME>. We will proceed when you are ready.~
@58   = ~I am sorely disappointed, however tutors are now instructed to give students a choice of scrolls when it comes to these tests. A practise I whole heartedly disagree with, but I do not make the rules. However, you will lose you some marks because of it. These are the scrolls you get to choose from. Make your choice quickly.~
@59   = ~I am pleased that you have decided to return, it shows you are committed to your studies <CHARNAME>. You are ready and have your spells to hand, yes?~
@60   = ~I do, Phineas.~
@61   = ~Of course, Phineas, I would not be here otherwise.~
@62   = ~I do and I assure you, I will not fail.~
@63   = ~All that remains now is to see if you have prepared wisely. We will proceed when you are ready.~
@64   = ~Nicely done <CHARNAME>. You chose your spell wisely. Now onto the second task.~
@65   = ~You will have only one minute to breach my defense. Within a minute you may cast any spell you wish but after that you must immediately cease your spell casting and inform me about this.~
@66   = ~ I am sorry <CHARNAME>, but you do need  to succeed in both tasks in order to pass. You should return to your studies for now, and I will see you again when I return and then you may try again. Farewell.~
@67   = ~Please, Phineas, let me attempt the task once more. I will not fail again.~
@68   = ~You cannot possibly fail me after only one attempt, Phineas!~
@69   = ~Is that it, Phineas? One attempt is hardly fair!~
@70   = ~One attempt is all you get! You may try again but not at this time. Now, you will return to your studies and I will see you again when my other business is concluded. Farewell.~
@71   = ~I am sorry, a brave attempt, but you do need to succeed in both tasks in order to pass. You should return to your studies for now, and I will see you again when I return and you may try again. Farewell.~
@72   = ~But surely having passed the first test, I can be given another attempt at the second?~
@73   = ~I have proven capable in one task, Phineas, is that not enough?~
@74   = ~Come Phineas, who will know if you let me attempt the second task again?~
@75   = ~I guess you are ready <CHARNAME>, so let‘s proceed with the first test.~
@76   = ~I am sorry, but you were too slow in casting spells. You have cost your life! I should by rights refuse you and mark you down for failing the test. Now, you may return to your studies, and I will see you again when my other business is concluded. Farewell.~
@77   = ~Congratulations <GABBER>, you show more promise than I have seen in a student for a long while. I will personally monitor your progress carefully. Return to your studies, and I will see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@78   = ~Nicely done, Nalia. You chose your spell wisely. Now onto the second task.~
@79   = ~Nicely done, Kachiko. You chose your spell wisely. Now onto the second task.~
@80   = ~Nicely done, Aerie. You chose your spell wisely. Now onto the second task.~
@81   = ~I am sorry, Nalia, but you have failed the first task and therefore forfeit the chance to attempt the second. You do need to successfully complete both tasks at the first attempt in order pass.~
@82   = ~I am sorry, Kachiko, but you have failed the first task and therefore forfeit the chance to attempt the second. You do need to successfully complete both tasks at the first attempt in order pass.~
@83   = ~I am sorry, Aerie, but you have failed the first task and therefore forfeit the chance to attempt the second. You do need to successfully complete both tasks at the first attempt in order pass.~
@84   = ~I guess you are ready Nalia, so let‘s proceed with the first test.~
@85   = ~I guess you are ready Kachiko, so let‘s proceed with the first test.~
@86   = ~I guess you are ready Aerie, so let‘s proceed with the first test.~
@87   = ~Congratulations, Nalia, you have done well and have earned your pass. Please return to your studies and I will see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@88   = ~Congratulations, Kachiko, you have done well and have earned your pass. Please return to your studies and I will see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@89   = ~Congratulations, Aerie, you have done well and have earned your pass. Please return to your studies and I will see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@90   = ~If not yourself <CHARNAME>, then let me explain the test and you can introduce me to the candidate when I am done.~
@91   = ~The test consists of two very simple tasks which will help me assess your magical ability in two areas of abjuration magic.~
@92   = ~The first task will be for you to protect yourself from spells that I will be casting at you. I will not make it easy by telling you the level of these spells but I will tell you that I will cast three in total. The second test will give you the opportunity to break down my own defences. Are we set to begin?~
@93   = ~I am ready to pass your exams.~
@94   = ~I am ready to pass your exams and I have the spells, but not memorised Phineas.~
@95   = ~I know you are disappointed, but don’t lose heart, there will be another time. I have other business away from the academy, but come and see me in a few days after my return.~
@96   = ~I am sorry, Nalia, a brave attempt my young friend, but you do need  to complete both tasks successfully to obtain a pass.~
@97   = ~I am sorry, Nalia, but you were too slow in casting spells. You have cost your life! I should by rights refuse you and mark you down for failing the test.~
@98   = ~I am sorry, Kachiko, a brave attempt my young friend, but you do need  to complete both tasks successfully to obtain a pass.~
