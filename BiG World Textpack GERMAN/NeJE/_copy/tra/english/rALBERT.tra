@0    = ~RUFIE!!  Who's a fuzzy Rufie?  Whoooooo's a fuzzy little guy?  Thank you just ever so much!  I better take this lost little puppy home right away.  Here, take this.  It's another of his chew things, but we can get more where we're going.  Thanks again.~
@1    = ~I um... rescued "little" Rufie and returned him to the... child... named Albert.  I do not wish to know where they went.  With luck I will never find out.~
