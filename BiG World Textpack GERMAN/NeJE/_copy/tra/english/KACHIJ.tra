@0    = ~Sorry, <CHARNAME>, I cannot stay with you any longer. Without Yoshimo, I have nothing to do in your party. I must go back to Kozakura. Good luck to you.~
@1    = ~<CHARNAME>, you promised that you would lead me to Yoshimo! Yet all we are doing is running around in small circles all day!~
@2    = ~Oh, and I was wondering what was it that we forgot to do? Kachiko, we are going right away!~
@3    = ~Girl, what do you need Yoshimo for anyway? Can’t you skip your vendetta or something?~
@4    = ~You better act upon your word, <CHARNAME>!~
@5    = ~No, I cannot. You lied to me. You have no intention to lead me to Yoshimo! I do not need your help! I’ll find Yoshimo eventually! I SWEAR I’ll find him! There has to be somewhere I haven’t looked!~
@6    = ~You lied to me. You have no intention to lead me to Yoshimo! I do not need your help! I’ll find Yoshimo eventually! I SWEAR I’ll find him! There has to be somewhere I haven’t looked!~
@7    = ~Ah, here you are, bastard! You thought you could flee far enough? I promised to find you even in Nine Hells! Prepare to die!~
@8    = ~Yoshimo, you sound sincere... Hmm... If what you say is true, we must come back to Kara-Tur and try to convince my family that you’re not the murderer. But if you lied... <CHARNAME>, we have to leave for Kara-Tur immediately.~
@9    = ~Kachiko, are you going back on your promise to help me?~
@10   = ~Of course, Kachiko, I understand. Farewell.~
@11   = ~<CHARNAME>, do you need another companion in your group? May be you let Yoshimo to tag along? Then I can keep an eye on him and we both will help you out...~
@12   = ~You will not get away that easily! Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I have to go after him!~
@13   = ~Don’t lie to me. You won’t escape again. I’ll watch you even if I have to break my word to <CHARNAME>.~
@14   = ~Of course, I need all help I can get. Welcome back, Yoshimo.~
@15   = ~I don’t need your help. Go away, both of you.~
@16   = ~I don’t know you, I don’t need your problems and I grow tired of this soap opera. Perhaps killing both of you will brighten things up!~
@17   = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@18   = ~Yoshimo, wait. I am leaving with you. Alone you will only get into more troubles. Sorry <CHARNAME>, but I told you from the very start that I would follow whenever he goes... and I shall do so now.~ [KACHIL26]
@19   = ~Yoshimo, I am staying with you. Alone you will only get into more troubles. Sorry <CHARNAME>, but I told you from the very start that I wouldn't allow him to escape... and I shan't do so now.~
@20   = ~Yoshimo, does not this... man looks a bit familiar to you? It is strange but he reminds me Otako Hashimoto.~ [KACHIQ03]
@21   = ~My guess is that the spell might have worked and we are somehow moving towards solving our family feud. But why are we on an island, and not at home?~
@22   = ~The spell... Harpel must have done something that works for once. Let’s go on, and we will have better chance to find some answers. Yoshimo, I am mourn your loss.~
@23   = ~There are more bodies out there. Do you see them? I cannot look, I am afraid to find my kin among them.~
@24   = ~Yoshimo, I appreciate what you have said. Even if you said it because you were afraid that I’d kill you both if you ever tried anything funny.~ [KACHIQ04]
@25   = ~I am surprised by your welcome, my cousin, after all those lies you told my parents to prevent me from going after Yoshimo.~ [KACHIQ05]
@26   = ~Hold Masaki, you are too hasty. Yoshimo is no murderer and we were going home so the proof of his innocence may be found. But now I meet you on this desolate Island, talking to me as if we are at home...~
@27   = ~I mourn Naoko. Yet your words scare me. What is this place? How did Hashimoto and Nakanishi come to be here? Answer me!~
@28   = ~Yoshimo is innocent and I will fight you if I must to protect justice, which you so eagerly discard! You are disgrace to Nakanishi’s honor!~ [KACHIQ06]
@29   = ~Does Masaki Hayashi speak for Nakanishi family now?~
@30   = ~I doubt that you find it in your black heart to tell my mother that Kachiko is praying to see her and plead her case...~
@31   = ~I go where I please. I refuse to see people as enemies because they are named Hashimoto.~ [KACHIQ07]
@32   = ~I am no assassin! And no one sent me!~ [KACHIQ08]
@33   = ~I am Nakanishi. Will you kill me as well?~
@34   = ~Do you know of any other way, Aino? I have no desire to kill scores of innocent people.~
@35   = ~No, Kachiko, you are right. I say we kill this scheming bastard instead, take the wardstone and get outta here.~
@36   = ~Sorry, Kachiko, I see no other choice. I really need this wardstone!~
@37   = ~Neither would I. Yoshimo, I love you, and if we are destined to die, then we will die together!~
@38   = ~<CHARNAME>, I think we should talk about what happened. Yoshimo had dishonorable intentions and it is your right to demand his death.~
@39   = ~What do you mean Kachiko? That sounds a bit extreme.~
@40   = ~Kachiko, my custom is more forgiving than the code of a samurai. I have seen Yoshimo stand against Irenicus and refuse to surrender me. I trust him. ~
@41   = ~Glad you reminded me of the traitor. I do not wish him in my party. He may do what he wants with his life, but he may not stay.~
@42   = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, Yoshimo pledged his service to you, yet he was serving Irenicus at the same time. His intention was to deceive you. Yoshimo is not a samurai and he does not follow a strict code of honor, but his upbringing was that of a noble. His actions towards you call for ritual suicide.~
@43   = ~I respect your customs, but he has a noble heart, and he’s faithful ally. He stood against Irenicus and refused to surrender me. I trust him.~
@44   = ~Uh, well... He may do what he wants with his life, but he may not stay.~
@45   = ~So you do not see his actions as betrayal, then <CHARNAME>?~
@46   = ~No Kachiko, the way I see it, Yoshimo was loyal to me in deed if not always in his thoughts. I am quite comfortable with him staying in the party.~
@47   = ~You have a different way of thinking <CHARNAME>, but I am... I am glad you do. Yoshimo and I will prove our loyalty to you in battle. ~ [KACHIL16]
@48   = ~Avenging the suffering of my family is a part of my life, <CHARNAME>. My blade is thirsty for his blood. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor! No more talk! I am going!~
@49   = ~Try to stop me! You would have to tie me up to prevent me from fighting Irenicus. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor!~
@50   = ~I have seen it, yes. I am not afraid to die if I know that Irenicus goes down with me. For Nakanishi’s honor! For Hashimoto’s honor!~
@51   = ~Are we dead? I only wished I could tell Yoshimo a proper farewell.~
@52   = ~Wait a minute! The ship is ours to take anywhere, right? <CHARNAME>, can we go to Kara-Tur now?~
@53   = ~Saemon, I have little knowledge of the sea travel. Can you tell me how long will it take us to get to Kara-Tur by sea?~
@54   = ~Oh, we will see Kara-Turian shores and prove that Yoshimo is innocent and restore peace between our families. I agree with you, <CHARNAME>, let the fate decide! Cast the spell captain Havarian!~
@55   = ~Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. Farewell.~
@56   = ~And I'll follow Yoshimo wherever he goes. He won't escape from me this time.~
@57   = ~How so? How did this happen? I ... I wanted to avenge the death of Naoko, but got killed! I'm so clumsy, I let her kill myself! I didn't train well, not enough. I should spend more time on the art of swording!~
@58   = ~But what could I possibly do against the daughter of the god of murder! Oh, I had to ask her a few lessons.~
@59   = ~Kachiko! Kachiko, what are you talking about? You are not guilty at all. Bhaal took a control of me.~
@60   = ~Kachiko, if the most famous sword master of Kara-Tur were at you place, he would also have found himself powerless.~
@61   = ~Kachiko, it is I who should ask your forgiveness! You're a nice girl and suffered because of my stupidity and arrogance.~
@62   = ~Bhaal! Why, <CHARNAME>? How did he manage to take control over you? Are your gods doing that?~
@63   = ~The matter of fact is that I placed the ring, which the priest of Kelemvor brought to Keldorn, on my finger, and lost control of myself.~
@64   = ~It's all my fault, Kachiko. Keldorn warned me not to wear the ring, but I did not listen.~
@65   = ~Are you sure?~
@66   = ~I'm sure. The Ring of Cyric gave me the power of god.~
@67   = ~Unfortunately, yes. No mortal can compete with a god.~
@68   = ~I remember you placed the ring on a finger. Why? Can it resurrect?~
@69   = ~I dont know. But I was hoping that gaining the power of god, I'd be able to save Keldorn. Instead, I killed you all.~
@70   = ~I hoped so. No priest could help Keldorn, only the power of god could save him. But let's go, I want to take you out of here.~
@71   = ~And you could not take it off yourself? Where is it now?~
@72   = ~Kelemvor, the god of death, took it off me. Let's go, Kachiko, it's time to come back.~
@73   = ~(Shudders) I wouldn't want to experience that. Will you help me and Yoshimo to go back?~
@74   = ~Sure, Kachiko, let's go.~
@75   = ~Of course! I don't want to stay here any longer.~
@76   = ~This land suprises me more and more. To find a man not afraid to lay bare his heart and soul to a woman, to risk rejection is a rare man indeed. This Govan will surely be upset to discover that his love is missing.~
@77   = ~Curious, you are worried for another's safety, Yoshimo? I cannot believe that you show concern for a girl you hardly know. Your flight from Kara-Tur was the action of a coward who's only thought was, and always will be, for his own skin.~
@78   = ~I do not believe I will find Yoshimo Hashimoto among these ruins, <CHARNAME>. I am certain his trail ends somewhere here in Athkatla, but then, I never was very good at tracking, he could be hiding out in such a place, I will follow for now.~
@79   = ~When I left Kara-Tur, I knew I had a long journey ahead of me but I never dreamt that my hunt for Yoshimo Hashimoto would take me so far!~
@80   = ~I know of magic, <CHARNAME>. I sense that this mage is powerful, but his power is nothing compared to the power unleashed should we be forced to face the wrath of the whole academy! Let us do what we must quickly!~
@81   = ~Sure, I’ll do it.~
@82   = ~A girl can only do what a girl can do, and only then if she has the right spells for the task! So less of the sarcasm if you please <CHARNAME>.~
@83   = ~Ok, I am ready.~
@84   = ~What can I say? I am sorry.~
@85   = ~Do we need an intelligence check or something here? All you had to do was to read a couple of scrolls... you can read can’t you?~
@86   = ~I don’t understand a lot about magic but surely it has to be easier to read scrolls then trying to remember spells that have been memorised?~
@87   = ~A spell is a spell whether it is cast from a scroll or cast from memory, there is no guarantee that it will be cast successfully. The slightest distraction or missed word and the spell will be lost or miscast.~
@88   = ~You failed, a simple kill the monster and open the chest task! It isn’t as if you haven’t done it before.~
@89   = ~It’s not that important. What is important is that Malvolio got you out safely.~
@90   = ~Even then, with the aid of the group, we didn’t always get it right first time.~
@91   = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>, but with my training, I should have been able to handle that better than I did.~
@92   = ~That was abysmal! With all the spells you have at your disposal, I can not believe that you couldn’t take care of a few pesky pests!~
@93   = ~It happens. I was probably expecting too much letting you go into a situation you hadn’t been given time to prepare for.~
@94   = ~I am Kensai as well as mage <CHARNAME>, trained with sword as well as magic. If I had been permitted  to use the skills that I have been trained to use, then believe me, those vermin would be dead by now.~
@95   = ~I... I do not know what I should say to you Taffic.~
@96   = ~I am confident I can do this.~
@97   = ~You call yourself a mage? Thanks to your incompetence, girl, we have lost some valuable prizes.~
@98   = ~It happens, we win some we lose some, I am sure you gave it your best shot.~
@99   = ~I apologised, but if trinkets are worth more to you than a competent warrior mage, don’t hesitate to say and I will be out of your hair.~
@100  = ~I am only sorry that my best shot was not enough.~
@101  = ~I am sorry <CHARNAME>, what more can I say?~
@102  = ~If I had a gold piece for each time I heard sorry for an excuse, I would be rich beyond your imaginings. Sorry is never an excuse for failure.~
@103  = ~No matter, you couldn’t have second guessed Vashon’s test, no one could... not even if you’d been a diviner.~
@104  = ~It was an apology not an excuse, but I guess you wouldn’t understand the difference.~
@105  = ~Being kensai trained first, I often forget how powerful my magic is. Knowing I can always fall back on my sword in any situation that arises, means I can be quite neglectful of my magic.~
@106  = ~Now that I have chosen to be a mage I must give more thought to preparing my spell book more wisely.~
