@0    = ~Ahem... dear <SIRMAAM> we had arrived it seems... ~
@1    = ~Where? ~
@2    = ~Uhm, that’s not Brinnlaw, I am positive... Maybe it is some part of Kara-Tur. You have couple locals among your ranks they would know better than I.~
@3    = ~We’d have to wait for the night to fall, to be able to tell our position from the stars. Meanwhile, the crew will inspect the ship and repair what we can. The journey ahead of us might be long and harsh.~
@4    = ~Then I suggest we go ashore and see if we can find some provisions or any clues to where we are.~
@5    = ~Then I suggest we go ashore and see if we can find some provisions or any clues to where we are. What about you, my trusty advisor?~
@6    = ~Then I suggest we go ashore and see if we can find some provisions or any clues to where we are. What about you, Bodhi?~
@7    = ~We need to cut more timber to repair the ship. Please, come back later.~
@8    = ~The good news is that the ship is ready to sail. The bad news is that we are far to the south from Athkatla, and I am not sure if we will see Amn’s shores again.~
@9    = ~I have no knowledge of these waters and I am reluctant to start out without more information... What is your command, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@10   = ~Well, I’d trade you my good news! I got a map, showing a magical portal, which can teleport our ship back to our lands, and a wardstone, which makes possible to restore our time-space continuum.~
@11   = ~Magical portal? Time wardstone? Sounds just as good as the Fog of Fate spell... Let me see the sea charts you get...~
@12   = ~Hmm, looks like it was made with skill. I have a feeling it’s genuine.~
@13   = ~I suggest that we go to Athkatla and then sail to Brinnlaw in a more traditional way, because the area miles around Brinnlaw is heavily warded against magical travels... Rig up, crew!~
