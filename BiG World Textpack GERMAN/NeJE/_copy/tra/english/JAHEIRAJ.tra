@0    = ~Unnatural creatures, unnatural place. What a dread to be here. Yet there seem to be some awkward balance in Nakanishi and Hashimoto’s war. <CHARNAME> your command to come here was one of the many leadership errors.~
@1    = ~<CHARNAME>, we must help... we can not leave our friends to face such danger!~
@2    = ~I believe Keldorn has been struck by Cyric's curse and he will most certainly die if any attempt is made to remove it. Only the gods themselves in their mercy can revoke the curse.~
@3    = ~I... I am dead. I can be reunited with my Khalid and be with him forever. I can  rest at last... but how can I rest, I have not carried out Gorion's instructions, I have not protected <CHARNAME> well enough, I left her...~
@4    = ~Jaheira! Jaheira, please, forgive me!~
@5    = ~Who's calling me? Ah, it is you. Why are you disturbing me? What are you doing here? What do you need of me? You are not dead also, are you?~
@6    = ~I have come to beg your forgiveness. You were my friend, my elder sister, my protector. You became the mother to me that I never knew, and I have paid you with beggarly thanks! Because of me you lost your husband, your friends, and now I have killed you too! Oh, Jaheira, I need you so badly!~
@7    = ~I have come to beg your forgiveness... I come to ask you to return. Jaheira, it is so hard for me to be alone, to be without you. You promised Gorion to take care of me, to teach me sense, to guide me. I need your guidance, please, you must return to me.~
@8    = ~What are you doing here, Jaheira? Your place is among the living, not here among the shadows. I killed you accidentally, I was not myself at the time! Forgive me, you know that it is this damned taint that is to blame. You know what I feel for you. Please, please Jaheira, come back to me!~
@9    = ~<CHARNAME>, I always believed that you looked upon as nothing more than a governess, as an annoying mentor, and now you are calling me friend, sister... mother even, this surprises me my girl. You know that I am also very attached to you. Do you remember how first we met?~
@10   = ~(With a smile) I do. You and Khalid were waiting for me in the inn and you took turns sleeping for fear you would miss me.~
@11   = ~I do. Imoen and I... we were bitten by wolves, and barely alive when we finally got to you. You were waiting for us in the inn's hall.~
@12   = ~I remember everything, Jaheira, everything. Our meeting in the "Friendly Arm", the conversation about the need to go to Nashkel.~
@13   = ~Yes. You truly remember, you have forgotten nothing. I will come with you.~
@14   = ~I must? Yes, I am obliged to Gorion. Khalid and I promised him we'd look after you. Do you remember our first meeting, <CHARNAME>?~
@15   = ~We were to meet at the inn.~
@16   = ~Was there something special about that meeting?~
@17   = ~Yes... oh yes. I remember! You told me that you and Khalid took turns sleeping for fear you would miss me.~
@18   = ~Khalid feared that we would miss you.~
@19   = ~Yes, that is why you took turns sleeping!~
@20   = ~Accidentally? I do not think so. Your taint got the better of you, and now you have no more need of me.~
@21   = ~That is not true. I do need you Jaheira! It was that damn ring, it deprived me of my senses. Please Jaheira, I had to do  something to try to save Keldorn. I could not let him die!~
@22   = ~Don't' you know me? If not you, then who knows me better? Remember how we met? How you and Khalid were watching for me and took turns sleeping?~
@23   = ~(Smiling) What is this? Has my girl fallen in love? Of course I will not leave you now, let us leave together.~
@24   = ~<CHARNAME>, I don’t know why we find ourselves so far to the North, but I feel something very unnatural in our current situation. Please, be very careful. This area is strange and I question whether we belong here.~ [mute]
@25   = ~What cruel sadistic trick is this? To give us our freedom only to snatch it back as quickly? Someone will pay heavily for this!~
@26   = ~<CHARNAME>, tell me why do you let this man Hrothgar lead you by the nose?~
@27   = ~You know very little of him and yet you follow in any direction that he takes you. He seems to be taking us in some very strange directions and yet you ask very few questions of him.~
@28   = ~Nobody leads me, Jaheira. It suits me to follow him for the moment.~
@29   = ~You know me better than anyone here, Jaheira. I follow Hrothgar because I feel that it is the right thing to do at the present time.~
@30   = ~Hrothgar intrigues me, Jaheira and I wish to know more of this strange life of his.~
@31   = ~I agreed to aid him in his task, Jaheira, whatever that may turn out to be, and aid him I shall. I agree things are not as we expected but I do not sense that we are in any danger from him.~
@32   = ~Have you really given much thought as to who or what this Hrothgar might or might not be? I do not believe that you have, <CHARNAME>. Stop and think about it for a moment at least.~
@33   = ~He travels with you through a portal, from some time in the past to the present day and accepts it as if he had only walked through a door to another room.~
@34   = ~Are you not curious or even worried as to why he expected to arrive out of his own time?~
@35   = ~I do have questions Jaheira, but if Hrothgar is not yet disposed to answer them I cannot force him to speak. We must wait until he decides when we should know more.~
@36   = ~I do not understand this strangeness anymore than you Jaheira. My thoughts, from first waking in Irenicus’ dungeon and all that has since occurred are muddled. I am continually trying to find reason for what is happening now but can make no sense of any of it. Fate truly does not wish me to know too much too soon is the only rational explanation that I can come up with.~
@37   = ~Giving my heritage Jaheira, should I really be surprised when strange and seemingly inexplicable events occur around me? Do we not usually get answers in the end? The answers to both my questions are *yes* Jaheira, we may not get the answers we like but we do get them.~
@38   = ~Then what do you suggest I do Jaheira, assault Hrothgar and demand some answers? I have certainly toyed with the idea more than once, but no, I see by the expression on your face that like me, you know that would not be a wise action. For now I will watch and wait.~
@39   = ~All the same, this is not a natural road to be on, <CHARNAME>. A road that leads to the past and to the present could well lead to the future. No such road should exist, balance in all things would not allow this to be.~
@40   = ~We as mortals should not be allowed to know too much as it is in our nature to meddle where we should not when opportunity arises.~
@41   = ~I hear what you say Jaheira, but I think you are worrying too much when you speak of meddling. I have no intentions of meddling with anything. You believe it is in the nature of mortals to do so, I think you forget that the blood of a god runs through my veins Jaheira, maybe my nature is different.~
@42   = ~I am not as you say Jaheira mortal. I have the blood of a god in my veins making me half god by birth. Perhaps I have the right to meddle if it affects my destiny.~
@43   = ~Trust me, Jaheira, I may not be able to explain our situation but I believe that I will know what the right thing to do will be when I have to make a choice.~
@44   = ~Humph! That may be so, <CHARNAME>, but if you value my counsel then you would be wise to stay close to this Hrothgar.~
@45   = ~He clearly wanted you on this quest of his, and I cannot help but think that it is because of your blood connection with Bhaal that he tried so hard to persuade you to join him.~
@46   = ~If this Govan writes poetry I do not believe that he could have harmed Leina. Such words are seldom written by violent men.~
@47   = ~This is not a wise thing to do, <CHARNAME>, upsetting the balance of what has passed and what is now. You will do well to think carefully on what this Tilorn is asking you to undertake.~
@48   = ~(*Wistfully*) So, we are to visit Ulcaster again, <CHARNAME>. The last time we were there Khalid was at my side and we had promised Gorion to aid and protect you should the worst befall him.~
@49   = ~The memories of such times are still painful but they are still good memories. We have almost come full circle in your journey, <CHARNAME>.~
@50   = ~Be careful, <CHARNAME>, it would not be wise to allow this mage to learn of your true identity.~
@51   = ~It would appear that our friend Xan was always a despondent fellow. I had thought it was his incarceration by Mulahey in those dank mines that had made him so.~
@52   = ~I have always had reservations about what we are doing, Hrothgar! We cannot change what has past nor should we attempt to! As long as individuals we all strive to maintain balance in ourselves, all things will be as they should be.~
@53   = ~We only have Tilorn’s belief that balance has tipped. He failed in his attempt and it looks as though we are about to fail too. Does that not answer your question as to whether we should be interfering here or not?~
@54   = ~Then maybe it is time for you to explain what this bigger picture is, Hrothgar?~
@55   = ~Hmmph! I just knew that was going to be your answer! There will be another time, Hrothgar.~
@56   = ~We have little choice, <CHARNAME>. If the alarm is raised we stand little chance against the onslaught of magic that would be launched against us, we must act quickly!~
@57   = ~The air here <CHARNAME>, it is different. I feel a slight chill in it but it is sweeter and more pleasant to that which we have become accustomed to.~
@58   = ~This place does feel different, but we should not get our hopes up nor let our guard down because of the way we feel. One thing is for sure, we will not discover anything standing around here so I suggest we move quickly and prepare ourselves for whoever or whatever lies in wait at the bottom of these stairs.~
@59   = ~You would do well to put aside your childish games Imoen. Look around you and see the real world for what it is, a wild and perilous place, not a playground.~
@60   = ~Insolent child! You will do well to watch that smart mouth of yours my girl, before it lands you in real trouble.~
@61   = ~I am relieved that at least you do not perceive me as an *old bird*. As for finding fault in others, I can only find it if it is there to find. I am merely trying to point out that what may endear you to your friends can just as easily alienate those who do not know you and your faul... uh... nature. That is all.~
@62   = ~Imoen you have much to learn, but I do not have the patience to teach a wilful child, nor do I suspect would anyone else. You will have to learn your lessons the hard way, by experience.~
@63   = ~(*Rolls her eyes*) I despair of you child!~
@64   = ~You look troubled by this man’s words <CHARNAME>. I saw nothing in his manner to cause such a look.~ [mute]
@65   = ~This is not possible! What is going on here?~
@66   = ~I... I know that man Jaheira... at least I know of him.~
@67   = ~What trick has that wizard played on us this time? I swear I will have his hide for this!~
@68   = ~What is it <CHARNAME>? Your face, it is as white as the snow around us!~
@69   = ~Hrothgar! A name I know but this makes no sense!~
@70   = ~You are not making sense <CHARNAME>. If we are as far north as I think we are, how could you possibly know anyone from this town?~
@71   = ~I did not say I knew him, only I know of him. Hrothgar of Easthaven, the name has become a legend in our time.~
@72   = ~There is something very wrong here. Legend says Hrothgar of Easthaven died over 100 years ago!~
@73   = ~I remember Gorion telling me stories of great men and women. Legends of heroes who have left their mark on The Realms in some way. Hrothgar of Easthaven was such a man.~
@74   = ~Has the portal done you an injury to your head <CHARNAME>? Legends are borne from past deeds, most men do not pass into legend until after they have left this world and Hrothgar is still very much part of this world.~
@75   = ~Legend tells of Hrothgar dying at the hand of a demon as he tried to defend his town, the town of Easthaven. You heard the man himself say, this is Easthaven!~
@76   = ~My head is fine thank you Jaheira. Hrothgar was said to have lost his life defending the town of Easthaven from a demon and yet, here we are in Easthaven and we have spoken to Hrothgar, is it any wonder I seem a little confused.~
@77   = ~I no more understand it than you. We are in Easthaven and Hrothgar is very much alive. Somehow we have been sent back in time and I do not mind betting that it is all Irenicus doing!~
@78   = ~Is it possible? That the portal has transport back to the past, if so for what possible reason? Could it be that this Irenicus is through with us and this is his cruel way of disposing of us so none shall learn of his crimes?~
@79   = ~We are in the past yes, but I am sure if Irenicus merely wanted to rid himself of us, we would be dead. Men like him have no conscience, nor do they fear retribution. No, we are here for a reason, you can be sure of that.~
@80   = ~If Irenicus meant for us to be here, then I can only imagine that he hopes we will change the past by some deed or action that will secure the future he wants for himself.~
@81   = ~We know how devious and brutal Irenicus is, he would not have had us come here if not for some devious, monstrous plan he has in that twisted head of his!~
@82   = ~This puts us in a very precarious situation <CHARNAME>. We must be vigilant and you must remember all that you know of Hrothgar and his battle with this demon. If things truly happen as legend says, we must not interfere or the balance may be disrupted irreparably. I repeat, we cannot interfere!~
@83   = ~I do not know this Hrothgar so it will not be a problem Jaheira.~
@84   = ~I do not know if I will be able to stand by and watch a good man die so horrible a death Jaheira?~
@85   = ~And you Jaheira, will you stand by and do nothing whilst a fellow being is torn to pieces?~
@86   = ~That is reassuring to hear <CHARNAME>, but to hear you say it without compassion in your voice saddens me. Let us hope we will not be forced to stand by our words.~
@87   = ~We have no choice <CHARNAME>. Do you think this is easy for me? If we are truly in the past then my own Khalid, the light in my heart, will be lost to me forever unless we find our way back to the future we left.~
@88   = ~No <CHARNAME>, it will not be easy for me to watch a man die to secure that future, and I will probably carry the pain with me for a very long time, but I am sworn to do that which is right in order to maintain balance in this world. Let us hope neither of us will be forced into making such a choice.~
@89   = ~Calm yourself <CHARNAME>. Whatever has caused such an outburst of rage from you?~
@90   = ~That madman has sent us to the past Jaheira! To be be more specific, he has sent us at least 100 years into the past!~
@91   = ~He is playing with my head again! To let me think I am free and then to show me that it is only an illusion! Curses on him, he will regret crossing me when I catch up to him!~
@92   = ~He cannot do this! He refuses to face me and sends us here instead!~
@93   = ~You are not making sense <CHARNAME>. What reason can you possibly have for believing we are in the past?~
@94   = ~That man, Hrothgar, I know him or at least I know what legend speaks of him. He died over 100 years ago defending his town from some demon. That town was Easthaven, the very same town that we now find ourselves in.~
@95   = ~This has to be another of his accursed experiments, damn this insanity! Legend says that Hrothgar of Easthaven died over 100 years ago Jaheira, he died defending this very town!~
@96   = ~Calm yourself <CHARNAME>. No one is playing with your head, least of all Irenicus. Where ever we may be, we are free of him.~
@97   = ~How are we free of him Jaheira? If this is to be believed, then that damned portal of his has catapulted us back into the past, which probably means only he can return us to our own time.~
@98   = ~You think so Jaheira? Do you believe Irenicus capable of travelling to the past, because if you believe all this to be real and not in my head, then that is where we are now, in the past.~
@99   = ~Free of him you say Jaheira, if you say he is not playing with my head, then we have all been sent back into the past. I doubt he would do that so we could be free of him!~
@100  = ~Calm yourself <CHARNAME>, we have not lost him yet. You forget, I also have an interest in finding this Irenicus, he still holds Khalid. It matters not where you believe we are, I will find him. Even if it means walking the length and breadth of Faerun or into The Nine Hells themselves, I will find him!~
@101  = ~You can walk as far as you want Jaheira, you will not find either Irenicus or Khalid in this time. They are in the future, whilst we are now in the past. Damn Irenicus and his portal!~
@102  = ~Unless we find someway back to our own time then I am afraid both Irenicus and Khalid are lost to us. You see Jaheira, that insane mage has somehow transported us back into the past.~
@103  = ~It is not so much how far you are prepared to walk to find Khalid, more like how many years are you prepared to walk? Irenicus has trapped us in the past Jaheira, him and Khalid are well out of our reach!~
@104  = ~Never before have I seen the destruction nature can bring when fully unleashed.~
@105  = ~If I had some milk thistle and dandelion root I could make you an infusion for your head right now but alas it is too cold for such herbs to be found here.~
@106  = ~Ghereg, I suggest you leave this area as soon as possible, gather the red and purple Frostberries that grow near hot springs. Mash them into a paste and eat them with boiled tundra grasses. That will make your head stop hurting. The remedy actually only works for ogres.~
@107  = ~Remedy for Ghereg.

We met an ogre in a tower in Kuldahar Pass. His name was Ghereg, and his head hurt badly. He told us that he came to Kuldahar Pass from his cave, that he was "called."  He said he wanted to pound his head against the wall to make the pain go away.~
@108  = ~Remedy for Ghereg.

We met an ogre in a tower in Kuldahar Pass. His name was Ghereg, and his head hurt badly. He said he wanted to pound his head against the wall to make the pain go away.~
@109  = ~Remedy for Ghereg.

We met an ogre in a tower in Kuldahar Pass. His name was Ghereg, and he asked us why his head hurt. We told him that his head hurt because he was a big dummy. He got pretty angry after that.~
@110  = ~Remedy for Ghereg.

We met an ogre in a tower in Kuldahar Pass. His name was Ghereg, and he asked us why his head hurt. We decided to leave him alone.~
@111  = ~Remedy for Ghereg.

We told Ghereg, the ogre in Kuldahar Pass, a recipe that would make his headache go away. He was very grateful, and promptly left.~
@112  = ~Yes, and I’m sure we will speak of it again. Whether <CHARNAME> is hard of hearing or hard headed remains to be seen.~
@113  = ~No Minsc, good and evil both have a place in Faerun.~
@114  = ~To maintain balance is to understand that the conflict between good and evil will always exist on Faerun. It is impossible to have both present without this conflict.~
@115  = ~Then as a druid, it is my place to strive to set the balance right.~
@116  = ~My faith in Tempus is such that he would not have put this path before me if it were not the right one to follow.~
@117  = ~I don’t see any other means of completing our mission.~
@118  = ~Why am I not surprised that the price for the success of this mission is the death of another?~
@119  = ~If this priestess is all that stands between the survival of Kuldahar, then her life is already forfeit.~
@120  = ~How about Imoen-Child-of-the-Ever-Wagging-Tongue?~
@121  = ~(*Sighs*) Life with <CHARNAME> is never dull.~
@122  = ~Tell me again Hrothgar, just how long have you known this druid Arundel?~
@123  = ~He may be an old and dear friend of yours Hrothgar, but he would not be the first to try and manipulate <CHARNAME> for their own ends. I reserve my judgement until this task is done.~
@124  = ~When we have all quite finished, I think it is obvious the gem is not here and we should not waste time debating the issue but do as Hrothgar says and make our back to Kuldahar without delay.~
@125  = ~If this place has truly been corrupted by evil then it is good that we are here to cleanse and balance it once again.~
@126  = ~Silvanus may the soul of our brother Erevain find its way to you.~
@127  = ~However did he come to be here? He didn’t leave with us and I am certain the avalanche has prevented anyone leaving Easthaven since our departure.~
@128  = ~A waste of a life... we could have maybe used his skills if we had known he was intent on leaving Easthaven.~
@129  = ~What did the poor fool hope to accomplish out here alone?~
@130  = ~Lack of choices is not our problem. Our problem is a lack of acceptable outcomes.~
@131  = ~We all do our best to look after Minsc. He needs us and we need him.~
@132  = ~The heavens forbid that life with <CHARNAME> should ever be boring!~
@133  = ~This Hrothgar, goes beyond *trust me, I can tell you no more*. If its trust you want then I suggest you think carefully on how you answer <CHARNAME>’s question! I have seen enough lies and treachery in the future... I will not suffer the same from you! Know this whilst you consider your answer.~
@134  = ~Look around you Accalia, do you know exactly where it is that Hrothgar has delivered us to... do you know which direction we need to take in order to return to Kuldahar? Of course you don’t, Hrothgar brought us here and only he can return us, he has no need to do us any harm, not whilst he holds the key to our return.~
@135  = ~Death is as much a necessary part of nature’s cycle as is birth. What we see here is an abomination in the sight of the Mother’s eyes, for the cycle has been interrupted and balance in this place has been lost. It is for us to release the souls of those poor wretches and bring harmony, not only to their spirits but to the balance in this place once again.~
@136  = ~(*Rolls her eyes and clicks her tongue.*) Tch... I give up with you child! Perhaps when you gain some sense and maturity, you will have cause to think on all that I have tried to teach you.~
@137  = ~Let us hope Larrel and Geralith will have good news for us <CHARNAME>. For as much as I can sense the imbalance in this time and my duty as a druid, should be to strive to correct it, I feel strongly that this is one time we should not interfere.~
@138  = ~You and me child. As much as I can sense the imbalance in this time and my duty as a druid, should be to strive to correct it, I feel strongly that this is one time we should not interfere. Let us hope Larrel and Geralith will have good news for us.~
@139  = ~For once you show some maturity in your words Imoen, there is hope for you yet. She is right Accalia, you know nothing. I have fought alongside <CHARNAME> and would so again in an instance.~
@140  = ~I can’t say that I am not relieved to be going home, I have a husband that I need to see, to know that he is safe, but if <CHARNAME> gave the word then I would remain here and fight for your cause. As it is, it is time for us to leave the past alone.~
@141  = ~I see in you the courage to restore balance to this place Accalia. I wish you well.~
@142  = ~Then it is as it should be and the future will be safe. You are a brave man Hrothgar, and your cause is noble, I wish you luck in this task you have set yourself.~
@143  = ~It was you who told me to hope when I despaired of seeing Khalid again and now my hopes are dashed once again, and the pain is tenfold. What right did you have to speak to me as you did and let me hope again? I do not wish to hear any more of your words!~
@144  = ~You! What do you know of my pain, you who have never loved, never been loved? How can you possibly know how it feels to lose a loved one? Your words give me no comfort half-orc now leave me be.~
@145  = ~My people have never worried about what has been lost to monster or to man.~
@146  = ~Bah! A foul business indeed. These creatures were gathering up the villagers and using them for food and as payment to the queen of the snake people!~
@147  = ~What sense is there in delay? It will only serve to allow the enemy chance to prepare further for our arrival.~
@148  = ~Let us thank Mother earth and pray to Silvanus that our opponent doesn’t change his ways.~
@149  = ~Now that we’ve taken the Gem from the creature, what are we to do with it?~
@150  = ~Calm yourself child, whatever the wager, let’s not disappoint them.~
@151  = ~Best not to look for allies in this forsaken place... we are on our own here.~
@152  = ~I shudder when I think what this Necromancer intends for that poor souls body. Visions of my own Khalid’s body broken and violated by Irenicus swim before my eyes. Such perversion should not be allowed <CHARNAME>!~
@153  = ~I swear I do not understand you <CHARNAME>, taking on such a request and you knowing  full well what the necromancer had in mind to do with that poor souls’s body.~
@154  = ~You saw the way Irenicus had defiled my Khalid’s body and how it cut my heart to see him laid out so. If you were not repulsed by such desecration then I fear I do not know you at all.~
@155  = ~Or not! We could just as easily have tipped the balance in ways we can not know.~
@156  = ~We have no idea of what changes have already taken place simply because we are here and have found the thing, but having found it we can not more leave it here than deploy it ourselves even if we had the key.~
@157  = ~Then it is decided, we take it with us.~
@158  = ~We’ll not know anything until Tilorn gets us safely out of here, lets hope he does it before RayVon discovers his mages are dead and his artifact is missing.~
@159  = ~Why does everything seem to rely on keys around here?~
@160  = ~If it’s made by mages then it may not necessarily need a key, it could just as easily need some incantation of sorts to start the thing up.~
@161  = ~Non of us are going to survive if you two carry on shouting at each other. Be thankful that there were no students to witness your little set to!~
@162  = ~Hrothgar is only expressing his concern for the group <CHARNAME>, not criticising your leadership. Now for all our sakes, stop being so defensive and take us out of here.~
@163  = ~All our bodies are destined to feed nature Shar-Teel, but that does not mean we gloat when death takes our companions so swiftly and so horribly. Have a care with your words in future my girl!~
@164  = ~(*Rolls her eyes*) Those two would try the patience of Ilmater himself, <CHARNAME>.~
@165  = ~Apart from that bit of trouble we had with Minsc and Edwin over Dynaheir in Nashkiel, I don’t recall having a more argumentative pair in party...ever!~
@166  = ~Nature has been wronged here <CHARNAME>. I can feel her sorrow over the way she feels she has been abused in this place. We should walk carefully.~
@167  = ~You are an abomination druid! Nay, I will not address you as such, for you are no protector of the mother’s children.~
@168  = ~As it was your failure to maintain balance in yourself that has caused the corruption here, so shall it be your blood that helps to cleanse it.~
@169  = ~I sense the struggle of nature herself as she battles to flourish and grow in this place <CHARNAME>. We must find what has caused this disturbance in the balance here and quickly.~
@170  = ~Well met Erhard. I sense a great imbalance in this wood and knowing that this grove is out of your jurisdiction, it worries me that what I sense warrants the attention of one of the Great Druids.~
@171  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is a matter I am bound to look into, please, Erhard needs our aid here.~
@172  = ~Will mortals never learn to leave nature alone! Is it any wonder the work of a druid is never done when men persist in upsetting the balance in ways such as this!~
