@1    = ~Uh, you can speak Common?~
@2    = ~Well, it looks like you're looting and pillaging this mill.~
@3    = ~Kuldahar Pass.

We met a goblin marshal in Kuldahar Pass who was going mad with pain.  He asked us what he was doing there.  We responded by telling him the obvious.  It looked like he and his cousins were looting and pillaging the mill.  He responded angrily, telling us that that they were without food and had been "called" to the pass.~
@4    = ~What do you mean?~
@5    = ~Kuldahar Pass.

We met a goblin marshal in Kuldahar Pass who was going mad with pain.  He asked us what he was doing there.  We asked him what he meant.  He responded bluntly, claiming that he didn't understand why he and his kin were "called" to the pass.~
@6    = ~Sorry, but I can't talk right now.  Farewell.~
@7    = ~Of course.  Not all goblins are idiots... just most of us.  Rrrrrraaaaa!  What is the buzzing in my head?~
@8    = ~What's wrong with you?~
@9    = ~Kuldahar Pass.

We met a goblin marshal in Kuldahar Pass who was going mad with pain.  He told us that his head hurt, that something was whispering things to him.  He didn't understand what was wrong with him, but he felt some instinctive urge to "answer" the voice in his head.~
@10   = ~It's your conscience telling you that attacking villages for profit is morally poisonous.~
@11   = ~Kuldahar Pass.

We met a goblin marshal in Kuldahar Pass who was going mad with pain.  He asked us about a buzzing in his head.  I told him it was probably his conscience bothering him.  He responded angrily, telling us that he and his kin were "called" to the pass.~
@12   = ~Hmmm... buzzing?  That could be mind-affecting magic.~
@13   = ~Kuldahar Pass.

We met a goblin marshal in Kuldahar Pass who was going mad with pain.  He asked us about a buzzing in his head.  I told him it sounded like mind-controlling magic.  He went berserk with pain shortly after.~
@14   = ~Well, I have to be going.  Good luck with your head problems.  Farewell.~
@15   = ~I'm not pillaging the mill.  Some of my men are, but what do you expect?  We have no food, and we don't understand why we were called here.~
@16   = ~The gods have callings for us all.  Even goblins... I guess.~
@17   = ~"Called here?"  What do you mean?~
@18   = ~I have to go now.  Farewell.~
@19   = ~I mean, "what am I doing here?"  Rrrrr... I don't understand why we were called here.~
@20   = ~I must leave you now.  Farewell.~
@21   = ~I... I don't know.  Something's in my head.  It's whispering things to me.  My mind can't understand it, but something inside me... something inside me does.  I have to answer it.  Rrrr...~
@22   = ~I hear it as well.  I feel it... but I am not compelled as you seem to be.~
@23   = ~It seems to me that you might be under the influence of mind-controlling magic.~
@24   = ~That's unfortunate.  I have to be going now.  Farewell.~
@25   = ~Bah!  Don't try to make me feel guilty for what we've done.  We didn't ask to be called here.  We need food and supplies.~
@26   = ~Even so, that's no reason to kill innocent people and loot their bodies.  Why can't you trust in the charity and goodwill of this village?~
@27   = ~That is no excuse.  For your crimes against the people of this village, I must exact divine retribution.  Farewell.~
@28   = ~I must go now.  Farewell.~
@29   = ~I don't know what's causing it, but it's driving me mad.  It feels like my head is tearing itself apart.  It wasn't so bad when I could follow the pull, but now I'm trapped in this damned pass.  RrrrrrAAAAAGH!  The pain!~
@30   = ~It's like a gnawing in my stomach when I'm hungry.  I must have eaten everything in this damned pass, and it won't let me be.  Why can't I make it stop?  RrrrrrrAAAAGH!  Maglubiyet, make it end!~
@31   = ~Feel truly blessed, my soul-kin.  If you could feel the torment that I... rrrrrAAAAAGH!  Let go of my mind!~
@32   = ~You're one of those stinking holy warriors, aren't you?  Don't lecture me, paladin.  I'll leave soon enough.  Standing near you makes the pain in my head... rrrrrraaagh... it makes it that much worse.~
@33   = ~Leave me alone!  Alone!  Rrrrrrragh!  The pain!~
@34   = ~What did you say? Rrrraugh!~
