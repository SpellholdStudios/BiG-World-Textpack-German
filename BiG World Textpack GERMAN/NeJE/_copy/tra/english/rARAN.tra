@0    = ~It's a matter of survival.  I have almost nothing to offer you.  Perhaps in the future I could aid you, but not now, not in this fight.~
@1    = ~I need your help *now*.  Without it I may fail, and then Bodhi will come after you.~
@2    = ~So you ask for me to come, demand that I try and kill Bodhi, and offer nothing in return?~
@3    = ~Maybe your survival is in more immediate danger.  I don't like being abandoned.~
@4    = ~I demand that you help me, Aran.  You owe it to me.~
