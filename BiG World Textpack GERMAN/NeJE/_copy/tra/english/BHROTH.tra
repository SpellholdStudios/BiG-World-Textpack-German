@0    = ~Dar I am intrigued, tell me how it is that you are so well versed in the common tongue? This is indeed a rare thing among your kind.~ [HROT_101]
@1    = ~I meant no offence friend Dar. I meant to say that your mannerisms suggest that you had some education in your upbringing and I am interested in knowing a little of yourself and your early life.~ [HROT_102]
@2    = ~Then I am truly sorry for that was not my intention. Know that I do not perceive you as inferior in any way. Can you tell me a little of yourself? Only if you wish to of course.~ [HROT_103]
@3    = ~There is very little to tell of me. I go where I am most needed at the time and when done I move on to the next place that requires my aid, but look Dar, we fall behind, we must hurry on.~ [HROT_104]
@4    = ~Dar my friend, we have not spoken much since our departure from Kuldahar. Tell me, how are you faring in these strange times?~ [HROT_105]
@5    = ~Then, I take it you are glad <CHARNAME> persuaded you to travel with us?~ [HROT_106]
@6    = ~You have no need to thank me Dar. You have a good and noble heart, you deserve a better life than the struggle for survival that you called life when first we met. I admit I had no idea where the portal was to take us, but it had to be better than what you had.~ [HROT_107]
@7    = ~That is good to hear, but you must remember that you have also played a part in gaining your acceptance. It is not only the ease of this time, you have done much yourself to earn your good name.~ [HROT_108]
@8    = ~I am pleased for you Dar. I was worried for a while that it might prove too much for you to grasp, but I can see there was no need for my concern after all.~ [HROT_109]
@9    = ~No more than I would show for anyone whom I count as friend, so come friend Dar, we have much to do.~ [HROT_110]
@10   = ~Yes <CHARNAME>? (*Hrothgar looks at you.*)~ [HROT_301]
@11   = ~I did not say anything Hrothgar.~
@12   = ~Are you reading my mind Hrothgar?~
@13   = ~Was that a question or an answer Hrothgar, as I certainly did not speak?~
@14   = ~What... did you speak Hrothgar?~
@15   = ~It was obvious that you were about to say something <CHARNAME>, when you opened your mouth and then closed it quickly. What were you about to say?~ [HROT_302]
@16   = ~I was about to ask you about yourself. Before meeting you I knew only the Hrothgar from legend and rumour.~
@17   = ~It is not often one gets to travel with a hero from the past. I thought that this might be good opportunity to learn some more of Hrothgar the legend.~
@18   = ~Just curious Hrothgar, how much of what these rumours tell of you are fact and how much is fiction?~
@19   = ~I said *yes*? A question in answer to the look on your face as you were about to speak <CHARNAME>. Why did you change your mind?~ [HROT_303]
@20   = ~(*Smiles to himself*) A legend you say. Well, suppose you tell me what you have heard that makes Hrothgar a legend?~ [HROT_304]
@21   = ~Why do you always do that Hrothgar!? Answer my question with one of your own?~
@22   = ~Are you really interested in hearing what rumour says or is this just another way to avoid my questions?~
@23   = ~Again you show reluctance to talk of yourself. I am beginning to wonder if you have something to hide?~
@24   = ~I would rather hear the truth of it from the horse’s mouth so as to speak!~
@25   = ~(*Smiles to himself*) Curiosity is good and I am also curious as to what rumour has to say about Hrothgar?~ [HROT_305]
@26   = ~I do not mean to be evasive <CHARNAME>. I am intrigued and wish to know what has been passed down in my name. Does that surprise you?~ [HROT_306]
@27   = ~There is really only one tale Hrothgar, and that tells of your death by the hand of a demon as you fought, very bravely it is said, to save your town of Easthaven.~
@28   = ~ If I remember correctly, lore says that you were slain, by a demon. It tells of your brave fight at Easthaven and of your dying a hero. An incredible tale do you not agree?~
@29   = ~Remembering what I was told, the legendary Hrothgar was slain whilst trying to rid the town of some demon. Whether successfully or not I do not recall. More of a fool than a hero if you ask me for even attempting to take on a demon, but I suppose that is the stuff legends are made of.~
@30   = ~Legend says you died a hero at Easthaven Hrothgar. Now, my being here with you before the event, is too weird to even try to fathom the truth of it.~
@31   = ~Patience <CHARNAME>! Allow me the courtesy of hearing what has been told of me first. Surely you understand my curiosity.~ [HROT_307]
@32   = ~So... So that is what the name Hrothgar has come to mean has it. A hero eh? As you say <CHARNAME>, I stand here now, so how to make sense of it is the question here I think, yes? Well, maybe the legend in this case is more rumour, what do you think?~ [HROT_308]
@33   = ~I do not know what to think. Maybe the legend is yet to be made?~
@34   = ~I do not know Hrothgar, you follow us from your time into my time, so maybe you have escaped the death that fate had planned for you? Perhaps you have indeed cheated fate.~
@35   = ~I do not know Hrothgar, perhaps you were not supposed to die by the hand of the demon and maybe fate has put you on this road to avoid it?~
@36   = ~Bah! Rumours are seldom true so I imagine it is the same in this case!~
@37   = ~That is true, to take on a demon would deem foolish, but so would allowing a demon to dominate a town without at least trying to put it down. There is no place for the evil and cruelty that would ensue from allowing such a creature to live. As you say <CHARNAME>, legends are made from actions of brave men doing what they feel is right.~ [HROT_309]
@38   = ~So, the Hrothgar of that time died a noble death, or so rumour would have us believe. Do we really know how noble he was or why he chose to do what he did? Of course, we cannot even ask the Hrothgar of now because he has not confronted such a demon, has he Hrothgar? Maybe we should ask, did it happen at all?~
@39   = ~Legends are indeed made from the actions of men, but because these heroic deeds always take place in the past how do we know truth from rumour?~
@40   = ~Weird you say <CHARNAME>, is life itself not strange with all its twists and turns? We never know what life, or fate, which ever you prefer to call it has in mind for us. Do you try to fathom fate? No, you give it but a fleeting thought at times.~ [HROT_310]
@41   = ~I am used to the strange twists of fate in my life, but this has to be the strangest. To be here talking to a man who, in my future time, would be many years dead.~
@42   = ~It is not the twists and turns of life that I find strange, those I am used to, it is more the reality that we are here discussing the truth of a legend that maybe never was, with the legend himself.~
@43   = ~It could well be <CHARNAME>, but maybe there are more answers to be found if they are sought not only with open eyes but also with an open mind.~ [HROT_312]
@44   = ~I have to admit to having been in strange situations before and always I keep an open mind, but this I cannot make sense of, yet.~
@45   = ~I am confident that I will unravel this mystery Hrothgar. I will be watching you closely with my eyes and an open mind as I am sure that you have the answers that I seek.~
@46   = ~Then maybe it is because you are not trying to understand what it is that you see. Perhaps you prefer to ask another to *tell* you what it is that you are or are not seeing.~ [HROT_313]
@47   = ~Mistakes are made through misunderstandings. Is it not best to avoid them if possible?~
@48   = ~But if we do not understand what we perceive, surely it is wisest to ask then make wrong assumptions?~
@49   = ~There is no mystery here. You may not have all the answers that you want, but think <CHARNAME>, life itself unfolds a bit at a time and is that not what makes it exciting. Not knowing what piece will unfold tomorrow that makes us look forward to the next day. Who knows what knowledge will come with each new day, but it is knowledge that  we have to discover for ourselves. As with life we often get only a piece at a time.~ [HROT_314]
@50   = ~Are you saying that the only way that I am going to learn anymore is by discovering it for myself?~
@51   = ~Now, why does it come as no surprise to me that once again, I will only learn something as and when I need to?~
@52   = ~You forget Hrothgar, answers can also be obtained by the sword. Is that not so?~
@53   = ~We also learn from our mistakes, so mistakes are a necessary part of our education. That is why it is important that we must make and learn from our own.~ [HROT_315]
@54   = ~(*Smiles*) Let us see what time brings <CHARNAME>. Look (*pointing to the group*), the group is getting anxious at our delay. Let us quickly rejoin them and be on our way.~ [HROT_316]
@55   = ~For now Hrothgar but we will speak again later.~
@56   = ~Be warned <CHARNAME>, violence does not guarantee the answers that you seek. Now I suggest that we make a move as the group is looking anxiously towards us.~ [HROT_317]
@57   = ~I have done talking for now Hrothgar, but there will be another time.~
@58   = ~Whatever legend has passed down, there is always some exaggeration of the truth with each telling. I stand here now, so how to make sense of it is the question here I think, yes? Well, maybe in this case the legend is more rumour, what do you think <CHARNAME>?~ [HROT_311]
@59   = ~I do not know Hrothgar, perhaps you were not supposed to die by the hand of the demon, and maybe fate has brought us together on this road in order to ensure that you survive the battle?~
@60   = ~Tell me <CHARNAME>, do you believe that our path is set and cannot be changed? Is it possible do you think, that even though we may get thrown off that path, we will always be returned to it no matter how much time passes?~ [HROT_318]
@61   = ~Hrothgar, you look troubled, is this to do with your words before we left Kuldahar?~
@62   = ~Do these questions have anything to do with your strange words about the feeling of having done something before Hrothgar?~
@63   = ~Ah, you are referring to what you said before we left Kuldahar Hrothgar. I had intended to ask what you meant by them.~
@64   = ~It was a feeling that fleetingly came over me as Arundel spoke. There was something in his voice, just as he died that caused a chill to pass over me.~ [HROT_319]
@65   = ~Tell me, what was it that he said to cause such a reaction?~
@66   = ~I took his words to be the ramblings of a dying man, and payed little attention to them. Perhaps you should also treat them as such if they trouble you so.~
@67   = ~Arundel was dying, Hrothgar, who knows what a man sees when death approaches?~
@68   = ~All I saw was an old man in the thralls of death Hrothgar. Pay no heed to his words is the best advice I can give.~
@69   = ~I heard only the words of a crazy old druid as he lay dying.~
@70   = ~Arundel may have been old <CHARNAME>, but he was not crazed. No, he was in full control of his thoughts when he died, that I am sure of.~ [HROT_320]
@71   = ~You cannot be sure of anything Hrothgar. No-one knows what thoughts are in the head of a man at the point of death.~
@72   = ~How can you be so sure Hrothgar? You have not experienced death, you have no idea how a mind is effected as it approaches. Even those raised remember nothing.~
@73   = ~You are always so sure of yourself Hrothgar. Arundel was old and foolish, he wasted his breath on meaningless words instead of saving it and allowing us to help him.~
@74   = ~(*His brow furrows*) It had nothing to do with his words <CHARNAME>. More to do with the manner of his voice and the look that was in his eye, he knew something that he seemed almost afraid to speak of, and it was as if he was about to speak of it when the life left his body. It was then I knew, but what it was I knew I could not grasp.~ [HROT_321]
@75   = ~I can see this troubles you Hrothgar, but it is too late and in my opinion best forgotten.~
@76   = ~Forget it for now Hrothgar. My experience has taught me that if I need to know a thing, then I will know it when the time is right.~
@77   = ~Arundel was wise enough to know that he had very little time left to speak, I am sure he would have spoken that which you most needed to hear with his first words and not with his last Hrothgar.~
@78   = ~Why did you not speak of this before we left Kuldahar? If you truly thought he had something of importance to say, then perhaps we should have resurrected him?~
@79   = ~No <CHARNAME>, that is not the way of the druids! They believe in the circle of life and that all things must eventually make way for that which is yet to be born or reborn. It would not have been Arundel’s way and that is what we had to respect. Even so, for a second as he died, there was something, something I felt I should understand, something Arundel expected me to understand. No matter if it is within me, I am sure it will come, I just need some time to think. Quiet time <CHARNAME>, and I cannot see us getting a lot of that for a long while yet. Let us dwell on it no more for the time being.~ [HROT_322]
@80   = ~Even so, for a second as he died, there was something, something I felt I should understand, something Arundel expected me to understand. No matter if it is within me, I am sure it will come, I just need some time to think. Quiet time <CHARNAME>, and I cannot see us getting a lot of that for a long while yet. Let us dwell on it no more for the time being.~ [HROT_323]
@81   = ~I do not feel like a legend Leina. From what I hear these tales tell of a deed that I have not yet done.~ [HROT_401]
@82   = ~Why worry about it Leina? If that is what fate has in store for me, then that is what will be. Neither the gods nor fate can be cheated.~ [HROT_402]
@83   = ~If only it were that simple. My task has brought me to this future date and it can just as easily take me back again. I would not refuse if that turned out to be. So do not go dismissing the tales yet, none of us know what tomorrow will bring.~ [HROT_403]
@84   = ~I thank you for your compliment Leina. Now, I only hope I can live up to this legend that you speak so highly of.~ [HROT_404]
@85   = ~(*Smiles broadly*) Tell me Melora, does it feel strange to you that I am here?~ [HROT_405]
@86   = ~How I come to be here is quite simple. <CHARNAME> was teleported through a portal to my time in the past and it was through another such portal that we travelled to here again.~ [HROT_406]
@87   = ~Now, that is a tale that will have to wait until I have more time to tell it.~ [HROT_407]
@88   = ~I thought I did Melora, I travelled through a portal with <CHARNAME>.~ [HROT_408]
@89   = ~At the time it was the right thing to do. Have you never had to make a decision quickly but know that whatever you decide will be the right thing to do? Well, this was one of those times. I was given a task to do and somehow I knew that my way was through the portal.~ [HROT_409]
@90   = ~(*Smiling broadly*) You do overhear a lot Melora, now I wonder how it is that you manage that?~ [HROT_410]
@91   = ~I am sure that it has Melora, but you are safe with this group. Blending is not necessary when moving around them, however keeping up with them is. Let us quicken our step and catch up.~ [HROT_411]
@92   = ~Think nothing of it Accalia. I would not have suggested it had I not thought you would be a valuable companion.~
@93   = ~You do not have to justify your faith to me Accalia. I have seen the look that leaps to your eyes when you hear of the need to take up the fight in Tempus’s name, and I have also seen the disappointment come into them when you learn that it is not Tempus’s will that you should join the rest of the faithful in battle.~
@94   = ~And that is why I am glad to have you with us. I could not wish for a more stalwart and honest companion at my side in these evil times Accalia.~
@95   = ~I will always give praise where praise is due, and from what I have come to know of you Accalia, you are more than worthy.~
@96   = ~It is clear your thoughts bother you Jaheira. The anxiety shows on your face. Would it help to talk about them?~
@97   = ~Khalid, your husband, of course I should not have needed to ask. I am sorry Jaheira. I wish I could offer some words of comfort, but all I can give you are words that give courage and hope that you may be re-united very soon.~
@98   = ~I know nothing of the kind of man your Khalid is Jaheira, but I am certain that wherever he is, his thoughts are not those of blame and you should not torture yourself so either. He probably worries for your safety and is more than likely doing all that he can to find you. He will not have time to let thoughts of blame come into his head.~
@99   = ~Hope and courage Jaheira. Do not ever let words such as *never* enter your mind, or else hope will also fade.~
@100  = ~Then I say again, keep hope in your heart Jaheira.~
@101  = ~I have wrestled with my thoughts for a couple of days now on how to speak to you about a matter that is of the gravest concern to me <CHARNAME>.~
@102  = ~I was always taught that if a body had something to say, the best way is to open your mouth and let it out.~
@103  = ~I do not bite Hrothgar, just say your piece.~
@104  = ~A couple of days you say, now what can be so bad that it has taken you so long to mention it?~
@105  = ~Are you still concerned about my purpose in being here Hrothgar? If so I suggest you take it up with Irenicus the next time he opens a portal in your town.~
@106  = ~I haven’t mentioned it because it involves you telling me a little of the future. All I ask of you is to tell me whether all this running around is a necessary part of this mission or could we reach our goal quicker by going down another path?~
@107  = ~I will be truthful with you Hrothgar, I do not know.~
@108  = ~I know you are worried for Kuldahar, but there isn’t anything I can tell you.~
@109  = ~There is nothing I can tell you. You know the risk of learning too much too soon Hrothgar or you would have asked me sooner.~
@110  = ~Jaheira is right of course and that is why it has taken me so long to ask the question, but I am becoming anxious that time may be running out for Kuldahar.~
@111  = ~You don’t know, how can you not know? You come all this way from the future, say that you know of me, but not what it is you know!~
@112  = ~Yes I know you and of your bid to help Kuldahar, but what was and what wasn’t necessary during your attempt, I have no idea.~
@113  = ~The story is vague in my mind Hrothgar, I never listened that closely to Gorion’s tales.~
@114  = ~I found Gorion’s stories of the old glory days boring, so I usually only caught the beginnings and the ends of his tales.~
@115  = ~I do know the outcome of your mission Hrothgar, but I am not about to risk my own future by telling you. So don’t ask me again or I will leave you to sort this mess alone.~
@116  = ~(*Sighs*) I suppose it is just as well. I am not afraid for myself but I worry for Kuldahar and maybe Easthaven if this evil decides to stretch its hand out in its direction. We will just have to assume that what we are doing has to be done, so let us continue without further delay.~
@117  = ~It’s not for myself that I am afraid. I have no wish to know whether my own life will be forfeit in this mission, but I am afraid for Kuldahar and maybe Easthaven itself should this evil decide to stretch its hand out in its direction. Please <CHARNAME>, you have to tell me, will Kuldahar fall?~
@118  = ~I am sorry Hrothgar, but it is not for me to say.~
@119  = ~I do not have to tell you anything, and as I have already said that I am not going to, you can stop badgering me!~
@120  = ~If I tell you anything Hrothgar, then there is the risk that the future I know and hope to get back to one day will not be there for me to return to.~
@121  = ~Damn you <CHARNAME>! You know and yet you will not tell me... I am sorry... forgive my outburst. You are right of course, after all it is your future that is on the line here should we mess with my time. Your concern is justified, my outburst was not. Let us continue and hope your presence here has not already affected your future.~
@122  = ~No, I have a far more serious concern on my mind at the moment. You pose no threat to this mission nor do you appear to be in league with whatever threatens Kuldahar, that I am sure of.~
@123  = ~Kuldahar is my main concern and equally as worrying, is whether Easthaven itself is in any danger. So I ask you to tell me please <CHARNAME>, is all this running around necessary or should we be looking elsewhere?~
@124  = ~Minsc my friend, whatever do you mean *ask first*? Why would you think that I brought you here?~
@125  = ~Minsc, if I was clever enough to make portals we would not be tramping these cold wet roads now, would we?~
@126  = ~Your theory is clever Minsc, but I did not bring you here. I did not even know from where you came until <CHARNAME> told me your story. The portal is as much a mystery to me as it is to you.~
@127  = ~I can assure you Minsc, if this wizard of yours is in the habit of visiting my town, I would know of it. I keep a watchful eye over both my town and its people. No Minsc, I do not think that was the purpose of the portal.~
@128  = ~If this portal originated from where you were held prisoner Minsc, then it could only be the wizard controlling it, but I have no idea why he had it come to Easthaven.~
@129  = ~I think that is a very good idea Minsc, it could be very important to know these things. I will leave you in peace to do your thinking.~
@130  = ~We do Dar. We both came to our respective towns by chance. I ended up in Easthaven when my adventuring days were coming to an end and Arundel, when he was placed as keeper of the great oak. Neither of us has deemed it necessary to move on.~
@131  = ~You will Dar, trust the word of Hrothgar. Your struggles, I am sure, have not gone unnoticed, the gods watch over the faithful and their devotion is always rewarded~
@132  = ~Look around you, you are no longer on a lonely road my friend. You are among people who have not given a second thought to your heritage, they see past the outer packaging to what is inside.~
@133  = ~You have achieved plenty Dar. You have become accepted as an equal in this group and you did not once let the cruel abuse that you have suffered at the hands of others destroy that which is human in you. Your road can only get easier from now on my friend.~
@134  = ~I do Accalia, but there is nothing I can say that will allay their fears. Believe me, had there been another way of bringing us safely here then I would not have acted as I did.~
@135  = ~Tell me Accalia, if it was not for your trust in Tempus would you not perhaps view me with the same suspicion?~
@136  = ~Your willingness to trust me comes from your faith in your god. Whereas these people have been abused and used barbarically. Then to find themselves thrown back in time, and in the company of a man who they know has more answers than he is prepared to give. I think their grounds for suspicion is well founded don’t you?~
@137  = ~It concerns me greatly, for I realise that should <CHARNAME> decide to abandon this mission, there is nowhere that we can seek alternate aid. We would truly be alone Accalia and I fear both Kuldahar and Easthaven will be lost. As you trust in  Tempus, so must I trust that when the decision to continue or return confronts <CHARNAME>, instinct will prevail and the right choice will be made. A choice, that no matter which way it goes, I will have to accept.~
@138  = ~(*He puts his hand on her shoulder*). If that is how it is to be, then know that I am also proud to have so brave a companion to fight by my side. Let us hope we never see such a day Accalia, but if we should, then we will face it ... draw strength from each others resolve to defy all that is evil and who knows, maybe Tempus will look kindly upon the bravest of his battle priests and we shall prevail.~
@139  = ~(*Smiles*) You ask that question in such a way that you wouldn’t be surprised to hear that I do Accalia.~
@140  = ~Astrolabes are I believe devices more commonly used to study the skies, or to be more accurate, the moon and the stars. Just the sort of thing you would expect to find in a wizard’s tower. However, I have no idea as to whether they can transport a body through time, and I am guessing that was to be your next question.~
@141  = ~Yes, you are almost certainly right Accalia. I know if I were in <CHARNAME>’s place, then that is what I would be thinking.~
@142  = ~I admit that it might seem that way, but all I have heard are questions that I would expect to hear from a person who is lost in another time, and anxious to find their way home. I still believe that <CHARNAME> will hold good on the promise to find and defeat this enemy with me.~
@143  = ~Then I will remind <CHARNAME> of the responsibility that comes with giving one’s word and of the responsibility that comes when that word is broken, but ultimately the decision will be between <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> conscience.~
@144  = ~Right. There is too much at stake to force a confrontation with <CHARNAME>, more than you can imagine Accalia. Just trust me when I say <CHARNAME>’s destiny is such that it is imperative that <PRO_HESHE> makes it back to the future. Please I can explain no more so please don’t ask me.~
@145  = ~You are indeed an exceptional person Accalia. Your trust in me is not misplaced nor will it ever be abused. Now let us continue and find out what this astrolabe is really capable of.~
@146  = ~Well that was... ahem... entertaining. Dancing has certainly come a long way since my days.~
@147  = ~Well, I must say it has been a while since I’ve kicked up my heels, but if the lady insists... just give me lots of space Leina.~
@148  = ~I couldn’t agree with you more Leina.~
@149  = ~(*Sternly*) Please, this is a temple, and not the market place! Or have you two forgotten whose presence we stand before!~
@150  = ~Well it is up to you <CHARNAME>, do we get our hot baths and Leina her warm fluffy towel now or later?~
@151  = ~Later.~
@152  = ~Better now then later.~
@153  = ~As you wish <CHARNAME>.~
@154  = ~No Leina, we only had small hamlets in my time... (*Coughs several times and scans the looks on the servants faces, relieved to see none has noticed his slip*)... er hem... I mean in the areas I have travelled.~
@155  = ~Not in the least, Leina. They were quite civil having the same amenities as the towns around here only on a smaller scale. Why do you ask?~
@156  = ~(*Looking at Leina as if she is a little girl up to some prank, he lowers his voice*) Leina just because I lived 100 yrs ago doesn’t mean we lived in caves!~
@157  = ~(*Then a little louder*) Oh yes we had many a fine galas. We would dress in our finest, that is after washing off the grime of the day, for only when the grime of hard work was scrubbed away could you smell the fragrance of the many flowers decorating the courtyards. You know Leina, even then after a hard day nothing felt better then a hot bath.~
@158  = ~We had better help her or we will never get any where... a house?~
@159  = ~Now that you mention it back when I was young there was a tale they use to sing about a man who had a box that was bigger on the inside then the outside. It was sung as a joke to get people laughing. It probably is the same tale. It could be quite true Leina for I am here in your time from the past and we did just come out of this sphere.~
@160  = ~I’m thinking we are going to hear this idea whether we want to or not, so go on, <CHARNAME>, tell us what you have in mind.~
@161  = ~Oh enough with your horse play! Leina always wants a hot bath let’s get the jump on her first this time. What say you?~
@162  = ~Sssssh. Now listen Leina always wants a bath after a battle and she hasn’t said anything yet so let’s do it first.~
@163  = ~Hey now, listen Leina is always the first to want a bath after a stinkin’ battle so let’s ask her first for a fluffy towel. What say you?~
@164  = ~(*Laughs heartily*) How little you know Leina my friend!~
@165  = ~(*Laughing to himself*) I am not sure who will be getting who, but it will be fun to observe.~
@166  = ~(*He looks towards Leina. She quickly winks at him and turns again to Samuel*) Well, I never... If I didn’t know better, I’d say that young lady is playing with us!~
