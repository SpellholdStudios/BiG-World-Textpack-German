@0    = ~Love is for weak-hearted rivvins...~
@1    = ~(Thoughtfully) I know not what to do. You have saved my life more than once, <CHARNAME>, and I am certain you will find a use for my clerical skills.~
@2    = ~It might be strange for you, more so for your paladin, to hear, but we drow do understand the meaning of duty and I do want to stay with your party, but... I... (she lowers her voice) I fear being recognized should I join this army <CHARNAME>.~
@3    = ~Viconia! I know your story, and Keldorn is sure to know it too. He will, I am sure, speak on your behalf.~
@4    = ~You are right Viconia. More so because I will not be in command there and therefore I'll not be able to speak on your behalf.~
@5    = ~It will only bring trouble to us all. It does not matter what you know or think of me.~
@6    = ~Are you saying that you have ceased hating drow, jaluk?~
@7    = ~(Casting a quick look at him) As you wish, Keldorn.~
@8    = ~(Politely) Viconia DeVir, cleric of Shar, yours to command, my lord.~
@9    = ~I believe Keldorn has been struck by Cyric's curse and he will most certainly die if any attempt is made to remove it. Only the gods themselves in their mercy can revoke the curse.~
@10   = ~I am a fool, fool, fool! How come, when I finally have a chance to pay my debts, to recompense all the good things, I let it slip my mind... I... I... cha'kohk ol jal let the demons take me! I wish I had burned away on that bonfire.~
@11   = ~Viconia, abbil!~
@12   = ~What? That's the first time I have heard a drow priestess damn herself.~
@13   = ~What? Is that you... you heard? You should not have heard my words, nobody should. Leave me be! I know you have come for me, but leave me in peace. I don't want to go with you. The gods do not wish me to live.~
@14   = ~Viconia, stop this nonsense. You have nothing to blame yourself for! You can't... there is no way for you to know everything concerning the pantheon of humans. After all, I myself should have guessed about Kelemvor, but we all were too anxious to think straight.~
@15   = ~You do not blame me? I was afraid to ask Shar for aid, but you know how much I... I respect Keldorn. I... let's go, maybe I can help him yet.~
@16   = ~The arrogance of the surfacer males is beyond belief to me! Such words would never leave the lips of a drow male unless he was arrogant enough to believe his advances were welcome, he knows to well the punishment that would be visited upon him if they were not!~
@17   = ~I have bad memories of those areas abbil. I had not long arrived on the surface and my life would have been forfeit because of surfacer prejudices if it had not been for you. I owe you twice and will continue with you to this ruin for that reason alone.~
@18   = ~You are expecting me to set foot in a school of mages! In Drow society no female would lower herself to do such a thing unless bidden to do so by the priestesses. Magic, fighting and the bedchamber are the only thing males serve any useful purpose in.~
@19   = ~Magic is therefore considered an inferior power in comparison to the power the priestesses wield. The magic schools, being for the male is a lowly place indeed! I will however, for your sake, try to hide my distaste whilst we are at this Halruaa.~
@20   = ~Humph... should such a creature seek to terrorise our cities in the Underdark, no drow warrior would  baulk from his duty to drive it out. You surfacers have no backbone!~
@21   = ~Ha! See what your male pride has brought you to gnome!~
