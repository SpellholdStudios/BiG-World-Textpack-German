@4    = ~I am no one to judge you, sister. May be you are right. But I am sorry for your paladin. Not only did you make him lie to Balthazar, but you also left him.~
@5    = ~Great, sister! You are right to leave the gods to dealing with their problems themselves! This is none of our business. And I hope (he winks) that you will allow me to take care of my nephews? I doubt I will have children of my own, little sister.~
@6    = ~I am no one to judge you, sister. It may be that you are right. But I am sorry for your paladin. Not only did you make him lie to Balthazar, but you also left him.~
