@0    = ~Papa?  Papa, is that you?  It's me, Sheemish.~
@1    = ~Papa?  No, I'm not your papa, Sheemish.  I don't have any children.  At least... none that I know of.  Heh heh.  Who is your papa?~
@2    = ~No, I'm definitely not your papa, Sheemish.  Could be your mom, but it's not true as well.  My name is <GABBER>.  Who is your father?~
@3    = ~I'm not your papa, Sheemish.  What's your father's name?~
@4    = ~My papa is Conlan.  He's a blacksmith in Kuldahar.  He's *this* big and *this* tall, and if he were here, he'd beat the stuffin' out of these monsters.  "Pow, pow!" "Oof.  Argh!"  That last sound was the lizards and spiders getting beat up... not my dad.~
@5    = ~Well, Sheemish, I'll see what I can do about "beating the stuffin'" out of the monsters for you.~
@6    = ~Fear not, lad.  I'll take care of the monsters.~
@7    = ~*sigh*  I can go kill the monsters... I guess.~
@8    = ~Beshaba smiles on you, boy.  You'll be lucky to get out of this maze even if I happen to kill everything between you and the door.  Farewell.~
@9    = ~I bet that my dad could beat up your dad.~
@10   = ~I already took care of all the monsters in the lizardman caves and everything between you and the exit.  You can leave anytime you want, Sheemish.~
@11   = ~Can not.~
@12   = ~Can too.~
@13   = ~Nuh-uh.~
@14   = ~Uh-huh.~
@15   = ~My dad can breathe fire, and he has a big hammer.~
@16   = ~Yeah, well my dad can shoot lightning from his fingers and throw giants around.~
@17   = ~So are you going to get rid of the monsters or not?~
@18   = ~Didja get rid of all the monsters yet?~
@19   = ~No, I haven't gotten rid of the monsters.~
@20   = ~Yes, I have.  You can leave anytime you want, Sheemish.~
@21   = ~Yay!  Thanks.  Boy, my papa sure will be glad when I get home.~
@22   = ~Farewell, Sheemish.~
@23   = ~Finding Sheemish, Conlan's son.

We freed Conlan's son, Sheemish from the depths of Dragon's Eye. We should probably return to Kuldahar to check on him to make sure he got home all right.~
@24   = ~Thanks again for saving me.  My papa said you could have this key to the chest in his shop.  He keeps a big hammer in there.  WHAM!  "How do you like that, Mister Giant?" "Raaarrr!  Not very much!"  Ha ha!  Get it?~
@25   = ~Yes, you're very funny.  Thanks for the key.~
@26   = ~Finding Sheemish, Conlan's son.

We freed Conlan's son, Sheemish from the depths of Dragon's Eye and returned to check on him to make sure he got home all right. He gave us a key to a chest in Conlan's house that contains some kind of enchanted hammer.~
@27   = ~Sure.  Sure.  Thanks for the key, Sheemish.~
@28   = ~Enough with the jokes, kid.  I didn't save you so I could listen to your yammering.  Just hand over the key and I'll be on my way.~
@29   = ~Someday, I'm going to make armor and weapons and horseshoes and spearheads and kettles and helmets and scythes and knives and mechanical dragons and spoons stuff like my papa, and it'll be great!  I'll put big razor things on all of the armor so it looks very scary!  "I'm a big warrior!  Watch out for me!"~
@30   = ~That's terrific, Sheemish.  Farewell.~
@31   = ~Thanks again for saving me.  My papa's going to be so happy when I get home!~
