@1    = ~(More resolutely) Keldorn, I wish to speak with a paladin, whom I admire. You always were a good example for me.~
@2    = ~(Even more resolutely) Keldorn! You and <CHARNAME> are not married yet, are you?~

@4    = ~(Confused) I... I do not have the right, but my thoughts were that you shouldn't as a paladin...~
@5    = ~(Perplexed) Yes...~
@6    = ~Had to? Oh, Arvoreen! I do understand. Forgive me, Keldorn, for being uncertain about you. You remain a fine example of a paladin, both wise and compassionate. Please forgive my doubts.~
