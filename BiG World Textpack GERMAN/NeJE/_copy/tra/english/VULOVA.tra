@0    = ~What? Who are you? I demand to know what you are doing in here!~
@1    = ~Fine. I am here to kill you and to blame your murder on the Shadow Thieves.~
@2    = ~Nothing. Sorry to have disturbed you. I'll be going now.~
@3    = ~I have been sent to kill you, but if you hide yourself for a time I may not have to.~
@4    = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I am looking for Leina.~
@5    = ~Are you Senior Armagaran Vulova? Samuel Thunderburp, the bartender of The Five Flagons was concerned for Leina's safety and bid us to find her.~
@6    = ~You must be Armagaran Vulova. We were promised a reward by the old barkeep of The Five Flagons if we found your daughter safe.~
@7    = ~Wh-what? But... my guards! They will stop you! ~
@8    = ~Not likely. They haven't stopped me yet. Consider your options here.~
@9    = ~No one will stop me! You die now!~
@10   = ~Good that you are. I should hate to have you killed for simple trespassing.~
@11   = ~What? What are you talking about? Guards! Expell this fool!~
@12   = ~That's not likely to happen. They haven't stopped me yet. You have no options.~
@13   = ~Fine! You will die here and now!~
@14   = ~Calm down. I won't kill you. You hide for awhile, perhaps in some other town.~
@15   = ~Pathetic. No, I'm sorry, but I've no other choice.~
@16   = ~Worthless worm! You will die here and now!~
@17   = ~No! Guards! To my side! Please!~
@18   = ~One moment Vulova, before you turn on me, what of your daughter, what of Leina? Do you deny that she is here?~
@19   = ~Thank you ever so much! You won't regret this! You won't!~
@20   = ~This city no longer holds any joy for me. Please my daughter, Leina, she is betrothed to one Govan Duvaine, will you please return her to his care?~
@21   = ~You will find her behind that door, but it will not be easy to reach her. Unfortunately, I have no time to clear the path for you.~
@22   = ~Guards! Kill them while I run! Now!~
@23   = ~Perform Bodhi's tasks to receive her aid.

I decided to give the merchant Vulova a chance to run and hide somewhere, instead of being forced to kill him.  He was ungrateful enough to sic his guards on me, but at least he's gone.  Now all that remains is to return to Bodhi and hope that she's fooled by my ruse.~
@24   = ~Leina? You think to find my daughter and murder her also? You black hearted fiend!~
@25   = ~Know that Leina is safe and well guarded. She is where you will never find her. None shall ever find her, she is safe now, forever.~
@26   = ~Believe me, I intend her no harm. The barkeep of The Five Flagons is concerned for her safety and has set me the task of returning her to him. That is my only interest in your daughter Vulova. I am here for you, not her, yours is the only life forfeit this day.~
@27   = ~I am not about to harm your daughter, Vulova. The barkeep of The Five Flagons has offered a reward for her safe return to him. I need her alive in order to collect.~
@28   = ~Yea gods man! Do you not understand, you are about to die, I am here to end your life! At least be sensible and tell me where your daughter is, give her a chance for life.~
@29   = ~I really do not want to kill you, Vulova, but your death is the only means of my getting to my own goal. Do not let your daughter also become a victim here.~
@30   = ~I have no intentions of killing either of you Vulova. Let me at least take Leina to the Five Flagons where she will be safe.~
@31   = ~Liar! You take me for a fool! Do you think that I do not know what manner of creature has sent you here, or that your purpose is to ensure that neither I nor my daughter remain alive? You may take me but you will not find Leina!~
@32   = ~Leina? You think to find my daughter?~
@33   = ~Believe me, I intend her no harm. The barkeep of The Five Flagons is concerned for her safety and has set me the task of returning her to him. That is my only interest in your daughter Vulova.~
@34   = ~Yea gods man! Be sensible and tell me where your daughter is, give her a chance for life.~
@35   = ~If your death is the only means of my getting to Leina, I'll kill you, Vulova. Do not let your daughter also become a victim here.~
@36   = ~I have no intentions of fighting you, Vulova. Let me at least take Leina to the Five Flagons where she will be safe.~
@37   = ~Liar! You take me for a fool! Do you think that I do not know that your purpose is to ensure that neither I nor my daughter remain alive? You may take me but you will not find Leina!~
