@0    = ~Ah welcome, welcome. I am Malvolio. The time has come around to test our prodigies already has it? Come, tell me your name?~
@1    = ~Well met Malvolio. I am <CHARNAME>. Yes it has and I am here for my assessment.~
@2    = ~Well met to you Malvolio. I am <CHARNAME>. Test you say, I am always ready for a challenge.~
@3    = ~I am <CHARNAME> and I do not need to be tested by you or anyone else.~
@4    = ~I am <CHARNAME>. Perhaps you can tell me of your tests another day, I am rather busy at the moment.~
@5    = ~It has Malvolio. I am <CHARNAME>, however it is not myself who is seeking your assessment today.~
@6    = ~(*Crossly*) Then unless you have other business here, stop wasting my time and be on your way.~
@7    = ~I am sure you know why it is necessary to test students at intervals as it was written in your entrance papers, but I will just run it by you again.~
@8    = ~It is not for us, the tutors benefit we have devised these tests but as a matter of safety for you the student. Magic can be a terrible force if wielded indiscriminately so it is for me to be sure that you can use what you have learnt safely.~
@9    = ~Then I am eager to prove myself, set your test Malvolio.~
@10   = ~I am confident I can do whatever you ask of me, so ask away Malvolio.~
@11   = ~This could be fun, ok set your test Malvolio.~
@12   = ~I would like to know a little more of what is expected of me before I agree to any sort of test.~
@13   = ~Good, good. Now, as a Transmuter, this test is obviously designed to see how you cope in a given situation with your alteration spells at hand. This is what I want you to do.~
@14   = ~The cellar downstairs contains a locked and guarded chest. Your task is to deal with the guardian and remove whatever is in the chest using what alteration spells you have. Are you ready to begin <CHARNAME>?~
@15   = ~I am ready.~
@16   = ~I know the appropriate spells but I do not have them memorised.~
@17   = ~No, I have nothing suitable in my spell book at all...~
@18   = ~Nalia is going to test her abilities.~
@19   = ~Aerie is prepared to be assessed.~
@20   = ~Kachiko is ready.~
@21   = ~Taffic, a big job for a little guy. Are you up to it?~
@22   = ~Jan, just imagine how smart the name Jan Jansen is going to look on Halruaa’s roll of honors when you pass this exam?~
@23   = ~Edwin, I know you don’t think too much to these  mages or their academy, and after all why should you, your intelligence and ingenuity surpasses all here. Just think for a moment though of the immense satisfaction that you’ll get from knowing that a red wizard infiltrated and passed their silly exams and them being too witless to see it.~
@24   = ~This is a waste of my time Malvolio I have better things to do than play silly games.~
@25   = ~Maybe another time will be more convenient for me Malvolio.~
@26   = ~Then no more talking, the test begins.~
@27   = ~And how may I ask did you expect to pass anything without any sort of preparation <CHARNAME>?~
@28   = ~No excuses the test just slipped my mind.~
@29   = ~I memorized what I thought was an appropriate selection of spells but I had no idea what your test would involve.~
@30   = ~I don’t have crystal ball, how could I have known what spells I would be needing today.~
@31   = ~Same excuses every time! However I am here to assess your ability to cast spells safely and accurately, it looks as though we will have to use scrolls today, but you will lose marks for this. Now choose two from these here and be quick about it.~
@32   = ~Slow.~
@33   = ~Stoneskin.~
@34   = ~Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.~
@35   = ~Polymorph Other.~
@36   = ~Polymorph Self.~
@37   = ~Burning Hands.~
@38   = ~Teleport Field.~
@39   = ~Color Spray.~
@40   = ~Tenser's Transformation.~
@41   = ~Flesh to Stone.~
@42   = ~Improved Haste.~
@43   = ~Disintegrate.~
@44   = ~Ruby Ray of Reversal.~
@45   = ~Sphere of Chaos.~
@46   = ~Knock.~
@47   = ~You may choose another one.~
@48   = ~You made your choice, now you may proceed.~
@49   = ~Then there is no point for us continuing further today. I suggest you come back when you are prepared but make it soon as I have another duty to attend to that will take me away from the academy shortly.~
@50   = ~(*Eyes you suspiciously*) Agree to be assessed? Now that is not what I would expect to hear from a dedicated student. If not for me to test you, then why are you here <CHARNAME>?~
@51   = ~I am here to be assessed, I just don’t want to agree to it until I know I am prepared.~
@52   = ~No... no other reason than your assessment. Let us make a start.~
@53   = ~No. I assure you I am here to gain Halruaa’s honor, nothing more. Test away.~
@54   = ~As you wish, but let me warn you, you may not get another chance at the test for a while as my duties will take me away from the academy shortly and I am not sure when I shall return. Farewell.~
@55   = ~Farewell Malvolio.~
@56   = ~I would not want to miss such an opportunity, so okay, I will take your test now.~
@57   = ~Goodbye.~
@58   = ~Then you know the test are you prepared? ~
@59   = ~Jan, just imagine how smart the name Jan Jansen is going to look on Halruaa’s roll of honors when you pass this exam? ~
@60   = ~Ah, so you return <CHARNAME>. I take it you have returned better prepared and now have the spells necessary for the task set?~
@61   = ~I have Malvolio.~
@62   = ~Of course Malvolio, I would not be here otherwise.~
@63   = ~I do and I assure you, I will not fail.~
@64   = ~Then no more talking. <CHARNAME>, the test begins.~
@65   = ~Then no more talking. Nalia, the test begins.~
@66   = ~Then no more talking. Aerie, the test begins.~
@67   = ~Then no more talking. Kachiko, the test begins.~
@68   = ~It seems you have already retrieved the scroll without my permission. Then there is no point for us continuing further today. I'll mark down you for cheating. Farewell.~
@69   = ~The task is set <GABBER>. You may proceed in your own time.~
@70   = ~Well, the task seems unbearable for you. Then better luck next time, but for now, I suggest you return to your studies and I will see you again when I return and you may try again. Farewell.~
@71   = ~Please Malvolio, let me attempt the task once more.~
@72   = ~Surely you cannot possibly fail me after only one attempt Malvolio!~
@73   = ~Hold a moment, is that it Malvolio? One attempt seems hardly fair.~
@74   = ~One attempt is all you get. You may try again but not at this time. Now, do as I have said and return to your studies. I will see you again when my other business is concluded. Farewell <GABBER>.~
@75   = ~Congratulations <GABBER>, that was very well executed. What you found in the chest is yours to keep. Shall we say, as a small reward. Now, return to your studies and I shall see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@76   = ~I am sorry I had to pull you out of there, but the task was set to test your magical abilities but in no way endanger your life.~
@77   = ~There will be other tests and I am sure you will do better next time. Until then, I suggest you return to your studies to prepare further. Farewell.~
@78   = ~Anyway against all odds you have done well. What you found in the chest is yours to keep. Shall we say, as a small reward. Now, return to your studies and I will see you again when you are once more ready to advance. Until then, I wish you luck. Farewell for now.~
@79   = ~Then no more talking. Jan, the test begins.~
@80   = ~Then why am I talking to you and not the one who is? No matter, I’ll explain the nature of the task that I have set and then I trust the aspiring young mage will decide whether they wish to proceed.~
@81   = ~The task is designed to show me how well you have learnt your lessons in alteration magic and how well you can deal with a given situation using only those spells.~
@82   = ~I have set a room aside, in this room is a locked chest and a guardian. The test involves you dealing with the guardian and removing whatever is inside the chest. Now who is going to be performing this task, come speak up?~
@83   = ~I am ready to pass your exams.~
@84   = ~I am ready to pass your exams and I know the appropriate spells, but I do not have them memorised.~
@85   = ~No, I have nothing suitable in my spell book at all.~
@86   = ~Then no more talking,. Edwin, the test begins.~
