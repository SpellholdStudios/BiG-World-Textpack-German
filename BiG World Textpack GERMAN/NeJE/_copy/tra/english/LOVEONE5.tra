@0    = ~Valygar? Is it you... did you return at last, my love?~
@1    = ~Why did not you come sooner? I died lonely, waiting for you...The waiting killed me...~
@2    = ~You never forgave, did not you? Your eyes are so cold...~
@3    = ~No, we could not have. You did not love me any more. You came back fulfilling your duty, no more. When I saw it, I lied to you! And I died then. I turned into a shadow. You killed me, not the Shade Lord...~
