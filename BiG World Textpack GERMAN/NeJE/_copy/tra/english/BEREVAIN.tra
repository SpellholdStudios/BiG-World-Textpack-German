@2    = ~Do you think that an expert infiltrator doesn't know when he's being inflitrated!~
@3    = ~Yes, you were! I'm not as careless as some of these companions.~
@4    = ~I will not be stolen from you harlot!~
@5    = ~Be careful that you don't steal what's not yours! There's nothing here that your child mind would be impressed with!~
@6    = ~Hey, Imoen shouldn't have tried to take your bag, but do you have to be so mean about it?~
@7    = ~I'm sorry about that Erevain, Imoen had no right to take that bag from you.~
@8    = ~If you can't defend your bags, then you can't be mad that Imoen wants to take them.~
@9    = ~You huffed pretty loudly when you almost lost an item. A thief was mad at a thief for stealing. Is the irony lost on you, Erevain?~
@10   = ~Be careful what you say! Imoen has been my friend a long time and she doesn't deserve to be called those names.~
@11   = ~(Pats you on the shoulder and smiles) You are more than welcome to be nice to rogues who steal from you, and I'm sure they'll be so grateful to you that they won't do it again.~
@12   = ~You're right, my apologies.~
@13   = ~Thanks. Watch her more carefully. Imoen's harmless thefts could do us a lot of harm eventually. Not all are so forgiving as I am.~
@14   = ~I did defend my bag, thank you. And yes, I can be mad at someone who wants to steal from me.~
@15   = ~I only steal when I need to or the person I'm stealing from can afford to lose it.~
@16   = ~So couldn't you afford to lose the bag? Sounds hypocritical to me.~
@17   = ~I don't care much at all for stealing. I'd suggest you cease doing so while you're in this party.~
@18   = ~I understand. We all have private things that we aren't ready to share.~
@19   = ~Then perhaps she shouldn't be taking what is not hers! I don't think anyone in this party signed up to be robbed by fellow members!~
@20   = ~I don't care what Imoen does! You had better not say those things to her if you want to stay in this group! She has been a friend for a long time and that tone is not welcome!~
@21   = ~Yes, she shouldn't have done that. But, neither should you say such cruel things to her!~
@22   = ~I don't answer to you. Leave me be.~
@23   = ~Then perhaps I should leave then. It seems that my well-being isn't important here.~
@24   = ~Yes, I think you should leave. I'm sick of your rotten attitude.~
@25   = ~I don't want you to leave Erevain; you need to understand the seriousness of calling Imoen such rotten names.~
@26   = ~Good riddance. Joining this group was a mistake. Have fun getting stolen from everyone.~
@27   = ~I'll stay for now. But dear Corellon help me! These people equate stealing with name-calling!~
@28   = ~Dear Corellon help me!~
@29   = ~All of this moving around and traveling. Do you ever get tired of it?~
@30   = ~I love travel. It's fun and exhilarating.~
@31   = ~I like traveling, but my feet do hurt a lot.~
@32   = ~Of course. I hate traveling.~
@33   = ~Why do you ask such stupid questions Erevain? Traveling is a necessary burden.~
@34   = ~It is exhilarating isn't it? To travel Faerun and see such sights and places is absolutely thrilling!~
@35   = ~I agree. Spending my whole life in Candlekeep hearing stories of faraway places and never being able to see them for myself, left me with a sense of wanderlust. ~
@36   = ~Yes it is. I never imagined the amazing wonders available to see and experience.~
@37   = ~Some of the sights are beautiful; some are terrifying.~
@38   = ~Yes, traveling can be thrilling, but can we please stop talking now?~
@39   = ~Haha, yes. Hiking over hills, valleys, and plains will do that. Still, despite any temporary pains.~
@40   = ~How could you hate traveling? There's just so much out there to do and see! Why would you ever leave home if you truly hated traveling?~
@41   = ~Because I couldn't stay cooped up in that boring old Candlekeep any longer. I had an opportunity to leave and I took it in haste. Traveling is much better than being completed bored.~
@42   = ~Because we always get attacked by horrible creatures who want to hurt us.~
@43   = ~Because my feet hurt from walking so much.~
@44   = ~Because I don't know why. Stop asking me stupid questions Erevain.~
@45   = ~Fine. I'll just stop talking.~
@46   = ~Yes indeed. Myself, I've always felt a calling to travel: to adventure. I've been traveling for twenty years and am nowhere near ready to quit now. It's quite an escape and a release.~
@47   = ~Twenty years? Isn't that a long time to be away from home. Don't you ever feel like returning? ~
@48   = ~Escape? Why do you need an escape?~
@49   = ~Absolutely. I was dying to get out of Candlekeep as a child and I'm thrilled to see where the road leads us!~
@50   = ~Erevain. You already said previously that you've been traveling for twenty years. Are you feeling ok?~
@51   = ~Aye, there are some scary creatures frightening moments to be had. But those do pass. In its entirely, traveling is such a magnificent escape. Such a release from the past.~
@52   = ~Escape? Release? Why do you need these?~
@53   = ~I suppose so. The monsters and bandits that die are unavoidable in these travels.~
@54   = ~Would you stop blathering about.~
@55   = ~Aye, traveling is certainly a welcome respite from boredom. Still, I would not trade away these last twenty years for anything. I just needed this release; this escape.~
@56   = ~Absolutely. I was dying to get out of Candlekeep as a child. Anywhere else is most welcome!~
@57   = ~Erevain. Are you unwell? You look different when you speak of the past.~
@58   = ~Erevain, please spare me your blabbering.~
@59   = ~I... I am sorry. Let us stop talking for now.~
@60   = ~Erevain. What's the matter? Why can't you talk about it? ~
@61   = ~You start a conversation and you won't even finish it? That's very rude.~
@62   = ~If that's how you really feel about it. I'm here if you're ready to talk about it later.~
@63   = ~Excellent. Less pointless prattle from you.~
@64   = ~No... No I am not feeling okay.~
@65   = ~I apologize. I just cannot talk now.~
@66   = ~Do you have any siblings or cousins that you were close to?~
@67   = ~I was close to Imoen, who is as close to a sister can be.~
@68   = ~No. I don't call anyone a sibling or cousin.~
@69   = ~Sort of.~
@70   = ~Stop talking about stupid personal topics. Do your job and that doesn't involve you talking.~
@71   = ~Well, I have a cousin that I have been close to, but haven't seen in a long time, Xan. ~
@72   = ~Xan? Wow, I know Xan. I met him in the Nashkel mines.~
@73   = ~Yes, Xan traveled with me for some time after I met him in Nashkel.~
@74   = ~How long has it been since you've seen him?~
@75   = ~I don't care about your Elven friends Erevain.~
@76   = ~How could you possibly have met Xan already? Why would Xan be in Nashkel so far from Evereska? ~
@77   = ~Um. Yeah.~
@78   = ~You would have to ask Xan about that.~
@79   = ~Well. I strongly suspect that that have been transported into the past about 100 years.~
@80   = ~I'm sure that it was a different Xan from your cousin.~
@81   = ~You know what, perhaps I'm mistaken. I probably haven't met Xan before.~
@82   = ~This conversation is getting annoying. Let's continue on.~
@83   = ~I haven't seen him in twenty years ever since I left Evereska. It's been difficult not to have seen him or any of my family for so long.~
@84   = ~That's terrible Erevain. Why don't you journey back to Evereska?~
@85   = ~I'm sure Xan misses your presence as well.~
@86   = ~Why haven't you seen any of your family for so long?~
@87   = ~If you haven't visited them in twenty years, waiting a little longer couldn't hurt much.~
@88   = ~Forget about them. If they really cared about you, they'd find you.~
@89   = ~I have no use for this annoying babbling.~
@90   = ~Fine. I'll just stop talking then. I find no sympathetic ears here.~
@91   = ~Then let's go.~
@92   = ~I... apologize. I can speak no more.~
@93   = ~As you wish.~
@94   = ~Erevain. Please, just say why you have such problems talking about this.~
@95   = ~If you're not going to say anything useful, then just cease speaking.~
@96   = ~I apologize... It is simply too painful.~
@97   = ~Why is there such hesitation in your voice at answering my question? Again, how do you know of Xan?~
@98   = ~Well. I strongly suspect that I have been transported into the past about 100 years.~
@99   = ~I misspoke. I have not met someone named Xan before.~
@100  = ~Enough with this second-guessing. Let us move on.~
@101  = ~I truly have no idea. I consider myself quite inane right now.~
@102  = ~That's ridiculous. Labelas Enoreth would never allow such a thing to one such as you. Traveling to the past would do great harm to Faerun.~
@103  = ~You're right. I'm just a crazed <PRO_RACE> speaking nonsense.~
@104  = ~Well. It's true, harmful or not, and now I need to return home to my time.~
@105  = ~Hah. That was a good joke. You enjoyed it Erevain?~
@106  = ~Who is Labelas Enoreth?~
@107  = ~May Deep Sashelas wash you of your nonsense. I can find no sympathetic ears here.~
@108  = ~If true, this is grave news indeed. I must accompany you and ensure a smooth timeline transition until we can discover a way back to your home. Labelas Enoreth, aid me in in these immense task!~
@109  = ~Very well. Onward.~
@110  = ~I will do as I please, timeline or not. And, you had best mind your place in my party.~
@111  = ~You are welcome to try. Let's continue to find a way back to my home.~
@112  = ~<CHARNAME>, you understand the import of my words. Altering the timeline can cause unforseen consequences and untold ruin upon Faerun and beyond. You must allow me to counsel you until your return to your own time.~
@113  = ~I'll do nothing of the sort, and if you try to stop me, you shall suffer my blade.~
@114  = ~You are correct Erevian. Come, let us continue on in these strange lands until we can find a way back to my home time.~
@115  = ~You are a severe threat to all of Faerun, <CHARNAME>. By the aid of the Seldarine you shall fall one day!~
@116  = ~(Sigh) Labelas Enoreth is the Elven god of the Continuum and Time. He watches over the Continuum and protects it from harmful changes. Now tell me <CHARNAME>, are you truly from the future?~
@117  = ~No, I'm just a crazed <PRO_RACE> speaking nonsense.~
@118  = ~Yes, it is true. I must find a way back to my own time.~
@119  = ~Very well. This is a sensitive subject for me. ~
@120  = ~Is this some joke <CHARNAME>? Have you truly met my cousin Xan? If so, how? ~
@121  = ~I misspoke. I confused that name with someone else.~
@122  = ~This conversation is beyond bothersome. Let's continue on and do not speak to me more of it.~
@123  = ~Growing up in Evereska we were always taught to disdain fire and all of its uses. It is a baneful force that should never be used by civilized peoples.~
@124  = ~That's silly. Fire is necessary for cooking, warmth, and light.~
@125  = ~I don't like fire either. It's destructive and harmful.~
@126  = ~Why this sudden fascination with fire?~
@127  = ~Erevain, I'm not interested in this idle banter.~
@128  = ~For other races perhaps. Elves often use magic to provide all of those items you mentioned. A heatstone can cook and warm food and a simple light orb can provide luminescence.~
@129  = ~Perhaps, but such items can be expensive and require mages crafting them. Anyone can light a fire.~
@130  = ~That makes a lot of sense. We should all use those instead of fire.~
@131  = ~Interesting. I'm not sure what's better.~
@132  = ~I suppose you're volunteering to craft all these items for us?~
@133  = ~And risk burning the forest, the jungle or nature? Such risks are not worth the danger!~
@134  = ~Surely, with magic so prevalent in Elven cities, such fire extinguishing magic should be quite easily available no?~
@135  = ~You're absolutely right. If the risk of accidental torching or arson is too great. Fires should be banned by the peoples of Faerun.~
@136  = ~Huge metropolises burn fires every day without these massive fears you promote.~
@137  = ~I'm not really interested in discussing elven propaganda.~
@138  = ~No, they are not. It is quite easy to create a magical flame and more difficult to put it out. Elven cities should proudly forbid fires. This prevents the need for as many countermeasures to put them out.~
@139  = ~That really sounds like elven cities are very vulnerable to fire. The buildings are made purely from wood right? This sounds most dangerous indeed.~
@140  = ~That makes sense. Prevention works a lot better than a cure.~
@141  = ~This sounds like some really strange anti-fire elven propaganda. Do your elven gods really approve of that?~
@142  = ~(Grr) Elven cities are quite safe! If you get to visit one someday you will plainly see that. Let us continue on; I grow tired of explaining the Elven ways.~
@143  = ~Absolutely <CHARNAME>. It is best to remove such hazards completely. The other races across Faerun would be best by following the elven example. Let us be off.~
@144  = ~Your words are most offensive <CHARNAME>. You would do well to live in the deep forest and see if you are so unconcerned about your safety. One spark can light your large cities as well. And may Deep Sashelas have mercy on your ignorant brethren's lot on that day when that happens. Let us be off.~
@145  = ~Then stay ignorant, friend. Let us be off.~
@146  = ~Should we ever visit my beloved Evereska; I will share these magics with you. Perhaps you too shall share them with others and in such ways all of Faerun may be made safer. You will readily glimpse the power of elven magic over mundane trinkets.~
@147  = ~I would love to visit that land with you Erevain.~
@148  = ~Evereska might be an interesting place to visit if the opportunity to present itself.~
@149  = ~I have no interest in visiting an entire region of uptight haughty elves.~
@150  = ~I still think regular fire is better.~
@151  = ~Yes. It is a beautiful place where all elves are greeted warmly... (sigh). Let us continue on <CHARNAME>. It is unlikely we would ever go there.~
@152  = ~Haha. I do not yet possess the craftsmanship and magical formulae to create such magical apparatus. However...~
@153  = ~You are quite wise, <CHARNAME>.~
@154  = ~Evereskan elves have developed some magical items to replace the use of fire. A heatstone can cook and warm food and a simple light orb can provide luminescence.~
@155  = ~Because I see such prominent usage of it in these foreign lands. Such dependence on such a destructive force. This is a worrisome trend.~
@156  = ~I believe you Erevain have benefited from these fires at night for warmth and light~
@157  = ~This is true, <CHARNAME>, but it is not the ideal. There is a better way.~
@158  = ~I had a hard time maturing in Evereska. I could never be satisfied. Rather than devoting myself to one discipline, I devoted myself to three; I also couldn't merely join one organization; I joined three. The Swords of Evereska, the Greycloaks, and the Vale Guard~
@159  = ~Who are the Swords of Evereska?~
@160  = ~Who are the Vale Guard?~
@161  = ~Who are the Greycloaks?~
@162  = ~How did you end up joining all three organizations?~
@163  = ~Erevain, can we talk about this later?~
@164  = ~The Swords of Evereska are an order of knights, paladins, and wizards. They defend the Evereskan hills along with the Vale Guard on occasion while sending out parties in the interests of Evereska and the greater good of Faerun. Sometimes they aid the Greycloaks and their collectors in their quests.~
@165  = ~How did you end up joining the Swords of Evereska?~
@166  = ~My father LLamien served with the Swords of Evereska during much of his adulthood. I joined out of a similar sense of duty and of the wonderment of these Elven Knights. Tales of subduing trolls, giants, and dragons that threatened the forest were boasted to us when we were young. I too hoped to have the opportunity to achieve such quests and grandeur. As such, my father sponsored me and with his help, I passed the basic tests of elven knighthood and wizardry with magnificent success.~
@167  = ~The Vale Guard are the main military forces of Evereska. They patrol Evereska's surrounding lands and skies as well as guard the 12 Hills and the Hidden Path. These are the most elite elven military swordsmen and archers there are. ~
@168  = ~How did you end up joining the Vale Guard?~
@169  = ~Who are the Greycloaks~
@170  = ~Most Evereskan elves conscript into the Vale Guard at some point following their passage to adulthood for some period of time. I was no different: joining them shortly after my adulthood ceremony and given my new suit of armor, Lord Duirsair himself sought to incorporate me into one of the units. Let us just remark that constantly patrolling every tree, shrub, hill, and tomb despite the occasional skirmish is most tiresome to both the feet and the mind.~
@171  = ~The Greycloaks are the detectives and law enforcement of Evereska. Whenever there's a problem that can't be solved with mere brawn or threats, you can be sure a Greycloak is investigating.~
@172  = ~How did you end up joining the Greycloaks?~
@173  = ~I was always good at sneaking around unwelcome locales. I ended discovering some discrepancies from a gnomish visitor to Evereska. I was both chastised for invasion without warrant and indoctrinated into the Greycloaks as an Infiltrator.~
@174  = ~In short, upon adulthood I was almost immediately recruited into the Vale Guard. During rotations, I found an opportunity to join the Swords of Evereska in a Quest to retrieve one of the Shattering Swords of Coronal Ynloeth. While on that quest, we learned of some orc movements approaching the valley and our group split. I ended up joining the Greycloaks as an Infiltrator to track down and spy on the enemy.~
@175  = ~What did you find?~
@176  = ~What happened next?~
@177  = ~Were you able to return to the Vale Guard or the Swords of Evereska?~
@178  = ~That sounds very boring.~
@179  = ~I'm sorry friend. This is just too painful. Perhaps we can speak about it some more later.~
@180  = ~I suppose I am just some incessant gibberling with nothing useful to say. Fine, you shall not hear of me.~
@181  = ~Why are you looking at me that way <CHARNAME>?~
@182  = ~You have consistently had trouble speaking of your past.~
@183  = ~You are always jabbering on about a topic before abruptly ending the conversation. Why?~
@184  = ~I'm not looking at anything besides a stupid elf.~
@185  = ~I wasn't looking at you Erevain.~
@186  = ~That's funny because I could have sworn that you've been looking at my direction recently for a long time.~
@187  = ~You seem to be troubled by your past.~
@188  = ~You seem to be wanting to say something and have been for some time.~
@189  = ~I'm merely dreading the moment you decide to open your mouth again.~
@190  = ~I assure you that I have not been looking at your way in any manner.~
@191  = ~Very well. Let us be off.~
@192  = ~I joined your party, <CHARNAME>, under the pretense of being treated respectfully. If you will not treat me so, then I will leave post haste.~
@193  = ~I apologize Erevain. It is difficult because you rarely finish speaking about your past.~
@194  = ~I apologize Erevain. I do not wish to be disrespectful.~
@195  = ~Then by all means leave Erevain. I grow tired of your irrelevant overbearing elven diatribes.~
@196  = ~Then I will free you of your burden. Good Riddance.~
@197  = ~Very well. Just be mindful of your words. They can be even as daggers to others. Let us be off.~
@198  = ~Very well. (Sigh) I shall tell you a story. In Evereska after joining the Greycloaks we determined that an Orc invasion was imminent. We had to quickly alert the Vale Guard, summon back the Swords of Evereska, and scramble the Winged Plumed Kingfishes.~
@199  = ~My mentor Yalatheniel ordered a group of Vale Guards and myself to join him in an anticipatory strike before the invading orcs arrived. We had little time to prepare. I snuck off ahead to scout the orc position when I was ambushed by a group of them.~
@200  = ~I tried my best, but was knocked out by one of their poisons and left for dead. I was able to awaken some time later to discover the horror at my eyes. My Vale Guard kindred were slaughtered as was my beloved mentor, the elf who helped perfect my combat, magical, and infiltration expertise.~
@201  = ~I had failed to stop or slow down those vile orcs and my dear friends were slain; that same orc party marched their way toward Evereska can began their full assault If I simply could have endured that skirmish, all would have been different; the enemy position and their numbers could have been reported back.~
@202  = ~Instead, Evereska was left blind and many elves needlessly died. I could not go back to my home after that. I could not look my fellow elves in the eye and feel their disdain. I left my only home and have not been back in twenty years.~
@203  = ~That wasn't your fault Erevain. You tried your best to stop them.~
@204  = ~You weren't the only elf trying to repel those orcs. Why did no one else anticipate these large movements?~
@205  = ~No wonder you have such trouble speaking of your past. You really screwed up and did a disservice to your people.~
@206  = ~What are the Winged Plumbed Kingfishes?~
@207  = ~Erevain, please stop with these diatribes. I have not idea of anything you say.~
@208  = ~Trying isn't good enough <CHARNAME>. When it really mattered, I failed; I wasn't strong enough and my comrades paid with their lives. What others did or did not do is irrelevant; I was as responsible for the as I was for myself. I cannot return to my homeland nor can I bear the shame of that catastrophe.~
@209  = ~No one is perfect Erevain. One can only be judged by his or her choices. Your choices were noble.~
@210  = ~I don't see why your family and people would reject you; you tried your best.~
@211  = ~If your comrades couldn't defend themselves, then that's their problem not yours. You are not responsible for the competency of your comrades.~
@212  = ~Evereska is one of the last elven fortresses on the main continent of Faerun. We are judged not only by our actions, but on their effect on the elven civilization itself. My kind's numbers are dwindling. To have any part in their further decrease is unforgivable. I was as responsible for the lives of those Vale Guards and Yalatheniel as I am my own. If I did not leave of my own accord, my people and family would have assuredly rejected me. Now I must content myself to drift from location to location, stranger to stranger, and try to extract some meaning for my continued existence.~
@213  = ~Aiding me and others, and making the world a better place is a worthy existence.~
@214  = ~Aiding me while exploring unknown lands and gaining knowledge is a worthy existence. ~
@215  = ~Aiding me while gaining power and funds to vanquish your enemies is a worthy existence. ~
@216  = ~This is above my head. I'm not sure how to respond.~
@217  = ~Perhaps you are right <CHARNAME>. I must find some reason to linger on. (Sigh.)~
@218  = ~It matters not. I simply have little purpose to my life anymore. (Sigh).~
@219  = ~I inflicted a great shame on my people that I cannot recover from. There is little purpose to my existence anymore.~
@220  = ~You are correct, I apologize. These aches of the soul should be burdened by one alone. (Sigh.)~
@221  = ~(Sigh) The Winged Plumbed Kingfishes are an elite elven military aerial order divided between Evermeet and Evereska. These armored elves ride giant eagles and asperii.~
@222  = ~That wasn't your fault Erevain. You tried your best to stop those orcs.~
@223  = ~What are asperii?~
@224  = ~What were we talking about again? I forgot.~
@225  = ~(Sigh) Asperii are a race of creatures with the innate magical ability to fly. They look similar to human horses, but are far more intelligent and powerful.~
@226  = ~What do you think about love?~ [stagnes]
@227  = ~Love is wonderful.~
@228  = ~Love is good.~
@229  = ~Love is awful.~
@230  = ~I don't think much about it.~
@231  = ~I am not sure.~
@232  = ~...~
@233  = ~I don't feel like talking about this now.~
@234  = ~Very well then.~
@235  = ~Well, let me tell you how I feel about it.~
@236  = ~Why would you say such a thing?~
@237  = ~Because love is awful.~
@238  = ~Because love is stupid Erevain and so are you.~
@239  = ~I am not really interested in any kind of love Erevain.~
@240  = ~I'm not interested in you Erevain.~
@241  = ~Love just breaks your heart.~
@242  = ~Love hurts more than helps.~
@243  = ~Love is a waste of time.~
@244  = ~I'm sorry, I am interested in the kind of love that lasts.~
@245  = ~I'm sorry, love is important.~
@246  = ~I am not for anything that will tie me down. I have a long life to live.~
@247  = ~Then I suppose we fundamentally disagree.~
@248  = ~I agree with you (Erevain smiles).~
@249  = ~For elves, love can be a short or long dalliance sometimes lasting even months or centuries. Another kind of love can last a lifetime and beyond. ~
@250  = ~What are implying Erevain?~
@251  = ~That is surely the same for many races and cultures.~
@252  = ~I am for all kinds of love.~
@253  = ~I am not really interested in any kind of love.~
@254  = ~I am interested in the kind of love that lasts.~
@255  = ~What kind of stupd fluffy elf love foolishness is this? Do not talk to me about this again.~
@256  = ~Yes, go on.~
@257  = ~As am I. (Erevain smiles.)~
@258  = ~It may be for more civilized races. I am most familiar with elves.~
@259  = ~Lasting Fidelity is not always common amongst elves. Many move from relationship to relationship and never tire of new trysts. Myself, I have always desired to have a companion throughout life.~
@260  = ~A soul that will journey with me in this life and beyond. Someone to love and cherish forever. I do not seek to waste time on a beauty that will die.~
@261  = ~I would value such a companion as well.~
@262  = ~Neither do I. I want beauty to last forever~
@263  = ~Beauty cannot and does not last. One can only enjoy beauty while it does last.~
@264  = ~Life is too short to try to find a perfect love.~
@265  = ~Fidelity is a waste of time. Why taste one flavor when you can taste many?.~
@266  = ~I think I prefer the common elven culture to yours Erevain.~
@267  = ~That's just stupid Erevain.~
@268  = ~I'm not sure what I think about this.~
@269  = ~There's no need to think too much all of this just yet.~
@270  = ~That's rather rude. Why would you say such a thing?~
@271  = ~Fidelity is a waste of time. Why taste one flavor when you can taste many?~

@276  = ~I'm sorry. I do not know why I said that. ~
@277  = ~Well, your previous words have already given how you feel away. I am dissapointed. ~
@278  = ~Apology accepted.~
@279  = ~You are a most rude individual. I am dissapointed.~
@280  = ~Fidelity may yet be the sweetest and most lasting fruit of all (smiles).~
@281  = ~I never said such practices were the most common, just that many elves lived that way. I do not believe we are compatible.~
@282  = ~I am glad to hear that (smiles).~
@283  = ~I hope that I can find such a loyal steadfast loving companion one day.~
@284  = ~As would I.~
@285  = ~I too would want such a thing.~
@286  = ~That sounds nice, but I do not know if it could last.~
@287  = ~What are you implying Erevain?~
@288  = ~That sounds very stuffy and limiting~
@289  = ~I do not want such a thing.~
@290  = ~I'm no sure what I think about this.~
@291  = ~I have no more words for now. Remember what I have said... and meant.~
@292  = ~There's no need to think too much on it just yet.~
@293  = ~Really? What do you mean?~
@294  = ~I'm not interested in you Erevain. Sorry.~
@295  = ~I'm not interested in relationships of any kind.~

@303  = ~I'm serious Erevain. I don't think I'll ever be ready for a relationship.~
@304  = ~I'm serious Erevain. I'm not interested in you. Sorry.~
@305  = ~I'm serious Erevain. I'm not interested in love.~
@306  = ~I'm not sure what to say.~
@307  = ~I'm sorry to hear that. As you wish.~
@308  = ~Companions and relationships tie you down. You can't live a free life with them.~
@309  = ~That which is eternal may never die (smles).~
@310  = ~Do you have a family? Blood kin that you care about?~

@316  = ~I don't have a family or blood kin.~
@317  = ~The whole concept of family and blood kin is stupid.~
@318  = ~Please stop talking to me Erevain.~
@319  = ~Then I suppose we haven't much to talk about on this issue.~
@320  = ~I am disappointed. As you wish.~
@321  = ~Really? I find that difficult to fathom.~
@322  = ~That is truly horrible. I cannot fathom having family like that.~
@323  = ~I am glad for you (smiles).~
@324  = ~Some friendships are thicker than blood (smiles).~
@325  = ~In Evereska I had a family. My brothers Erlathan and Ermmyth, my father LLamien and mother Ossianya and of course my relatives including my gloomy cousin Xan. It was a wonderful time while it lasted. A good family can be such a blessing. I'm sorry that you didn't have the best situation.~
@326  = ~Gorion was a blessing. He raised and took care of me well. My childhood was decent given the circumstances.~
@327  = ~Gorion is a blessing. He raised and took care of me well. My childhood was decent given the circumstances.~
@328  = ~Imoen was wonderful. A treasured childhood friend. My early life was decent given the circumstances.~
@329  = ~Imoen is wonderful. A treasured childhood and adult friend. My early life was decent given the circumstances.~

@340  = ~I'm ashamed of what happened. I have been gone so long. I truly wonder if I will ever be able to return home. Will I ever be accepted again?~
@341  = ~I'm sure your family would welcome you back.~
@342  = ~Time heals wounds. ~
@343  = ~I hope that they would accept you again.~
@344  = ~I don't think that they would take you back.~
@345  = ~There's no way that they would welcome you again.~
@346  = ~I don't know if you would be accepted or not.~
@347  = ~I don't know either, but I hope I would be.~
@348  = ~I can't let myself fully believe that. I just cannot.~
@349  = ~I hope so as well.~

@351  = ~Thank you. I hope that they do.~
@352  = ~I have always wanted to make my family and my people proud of me. I still want that. I still want them to be proud of me. I have to do something ... something great that will earn their admiration and respect; something to earn it back again.~

@354  = ~Your have done plenty to make your family proud.~
@355  = ~You don't need to make your family proud~
@356  = ~You're right, you must do something to make your family proud.~
@357  = ~Are you sure that you have to do something to earn their respect?~
@358  = ~There's nothing that you can do that would ever be good enough for them.~
@359  = ~You might be right, but I don't know that for sure.~
@360  = ~I will have to think of something.~
@361  = ~Absolutely. I have disgraced myself and must work to return to their graces.~
@362  = ~But, I must. Family is very important to me.~
@363  = ~Thank you. I hope that they will feel that way.~
@364  = ~Whatever happens. One day I will return home and good or bad I will have to face my family.~
@365  = ~It is my hope that you would consider coming with me. I would enjoy your company and assistance.~
@366  = ~I would love to come with you.~
@367  = ~I might come with you.~
@368  = ~I would wish you well, but would not come with you.~
@369  = ~I would never come with you.~
@370  = ~I would like to remember you just like this.~
@371  = ~I don't believe you (smiles).~
@372  = ~Why is Erevain always so moody about his past. Maybe there's something in that journal I seem him writing occasionally. (Sneaks nearby Erevain resting and grabs Erevain's bag.)~
@373  = ~Um, er....no...~
@374  = ~I wasn't inflitrating you. I...~
@375  = ~Hey, be careful what you say grumblebutt! Take your stupid bag and journal! (Imoen lets go of Erevain's bag.)~
@376  = ~Watch where your loose tongue points elfling!~
@377  = ~Imoen, why are you always so cheerful?~
@378  = ~Well I am most of the time. What's there not to be cheerful about? Birds, music, pages of books that never seem to crease correctly ever again.~
@379  = ~You warm my heart child. I wish I could remain as spirited as you Imoen.~
@380  = ~Hey buster, I'm older than you given all of my troubles and torture. What reason do you have to be so cold?~
@381  = ~I...~
@382  = ~Yes?~
@383  = ~...I cannot answer~
@384  = ~Sure ya can. Just spit it out already!~
@385  = ~No, I'm sorry let just move on.~
@386  = ~Come on Erevain. Lighten up. What's got yer tongue so twisted?~
@387  = ~I said No Imoen! Leave me be.~
@388  = ~Geez. Be that way then.~
@389  = ~...I cannot answer.~
@390  = ~Imoen, did you ever manage to visit beautiful places as a young one? Ever get out of that dusty Candlekeep?~
@391  = ~<CHARNAME> and I rarely got out. We were always chastised that we wouldn't be allowed back inside if we left the walls. I think that was more to scare us than anything. But, there were a few times we got to see outside. When I did, I always wanted to visit the beautiful forests and all of the life they had to show.~
@392  = ~That reminds me of my home of Evereska. Imoen, we had the most beautiful forests in all of Faerun. Every tenday I would travel up and down each tree reciting each one's name: Agala, Einid, Ogainithyn, Illesmyin, Nintomyan, Erevain, and so on.~
@393  = ~Erevain? Really? Did your parents name you after a big stick with greens? What came first, you or the tree?~
@394  = ~The tree. An ancient exquisite Duskwood that has been growing for centuries prior to my birth. Such namings are not uncommon amongst the elves.~
@395  = ~So does every coffee mug, every weed, and that pebble over their have names too?~
@396  = ~You make me smile Imoen. No, Not everything in nature have a name.~
@397  = ~Well I'd bet your name was a lot better than most other ones out there and it helped make you more famous in Evereska.~
@398  = ~Maybe later.~
@399  = ~What?~
@400  = ~Later. Maybe. Let's continue moving.~
@401  = ~I wanted to apologize to you for my earlier comments.~
@402  = ~(Stands up straight) And, exactly what would those comments be?~
@403  = ~And? What?~
@404  = ~You called me another name too!~
@405  = ~I did? (Erevain scratches his head a bit...) Yes, I apologize for calling you a child.~
@406  = ~(Smiles) Thank you.~
@407  = ~(Smiles a bit and sighs) Thank you. You've always been a cheerful and kind companion despite my behavior. Thank you.~
@408  = ~Well yeah, we can't all be grumblebutts. That wouldn't be much fun. (Pokes Erevain playfully.)~
@409  = ~(Laughs) I can see why you and <CHARNAME> have traveled together for so long.~
@410  = ~Despite everything, I know that you harbor some good feelings about your home of Candlekeep.~
@411  = ~Ya I do. It was a stuffy uptight place full of fun opportunities to pull pranks. But, it was home.~
@412  = ~My home was a giant maple tree. Filled with markings of my ancestors generations back until the founding of the Blacksheaf clan. There was laughter and play at every season of each year there. All of my siblings and cousins would play around it together. That tree housed, warmed, and fed us with its delicious syrup.~
@413  = ~That sounds like a very happy childhood home.~
@414  = ~I would love to take you there and show it to you one day. I am sure the Evereskans would allow a savior of an elven city to visit with honors.~
@415  = ~And I would love to visit it with you one day when the world does not require as much saving.~
@416  = ~That would be most wonderful.~
@417  = ~Minsc, would you consider Rashemen to be as cold as Icewind Dale?~
@418  = ~Beloved Rashemen was far colder than any puny Dale. Minsc had to use his beserker strength just to warm up Boo. Brr. This place is rather cold and Boo is freezing. Maybe this place is like Rashmen.~
@419  = ~Are you sure?~
@420  = ~What's that Boo? Yes. This area does remind me of home. Minsc would love to meet some mighty barbarian warriors here. Such mammoth warriors are an inspiration to all.~
@421  = ~Well, if we do run into any barbarians. I'll be glad to have you with me Minsc. You are a most formidable weapon.~
@422  = ~No. Boo is the most fearsome weapon. Evil be wary of his harp claws and pointy teeth!~
@423  = ~In Elven lands we have intelligent pets called Cooshees. They are often erroneously referred to as a breed of dogs by outsiders.~
@424  = ~Boo is an intelligent miniature giant space hamster which others foolishly refer to as a normal hamster.~
@425  = ~Hah, how do you know that Boo is intelligent?~
@426  = ~You are funny elf. Go ahead. Ask Boo any question. He is a very smart.~
@427  = ~Boo. Roll around.~
@428  = ~(Whispers to Boo...) See there he did.~
@429  = ~What are the days of the TEXITay?~
@430  = ~(Whispers to Boo...) Firstday, Seconday, Thirdday, Fourthday, Fifthday, Sixthday, Seventhday, Eigthday, Ninthday, Tenthday.~
@431  = ~Grrr. You are the the one reciting these answers. Not Boo!~
@432  = ~Haha. Erevain, it is not Minsc or Boo's fault that you do not speak Giant Space Hamster. Do no worry. We Minsc and Boo do not doubt your intelligence though.~
@433  = ~Aerie. I'm sorry; I feel so sorry for you.~
@434  = ~Thank you for your pity Erevain. It is hard, but I just have to make the best of the situation. I do have help though. Quayle, Baervan, <CHARNAME>, and now you Erevain.~
@435  = ~Aerie. You're a lovely woman and we here are all very lucky to have you traveling with us. I just can't wait to see what comes ahead!~
@436  = ~Erevain, you are so sweet. Come, let us continue on.~
@437  = ~Aerie, you are beautiful.~
@438  = ~Erevain, what is beauty?~
@439  = ~Beauty is what is desirous. What tantalizes the senses and brings that instant sense of awe.~
@440  = ~So, lust is beauty?~
@441  = ~Not quite. True beauty is something we're simply instantly attracted to; it is something we want to have or be around.~
@442  = ~So, beauty is lust.~
@443  = ~Hmm. I guess it is hard to separate two.~
@444  = ~Beauty is just a quality. Lust is just a way to appreciate that beauty in a way that is too much.~
@445  = ~I have a lust for life and if that is too much, so be it!~
@446  = ~Of that I am sure Erevain.~
@447  = ~Nalia, I do not understand. How can you humans stand this food?~
@448  = ~What do you mean Erevain?~
@449  = ~This food is just...hard to swallow. I can't believe that you all eat this regularly.~
@450  = ~This is just roasted meat! Elves do eat meat right?~
@451  = ~Sparingly, but yes. Ugh...~
@452  = ~What's the matter Erevain?~
@453  = ~I don't think my stomach can handle this roughness.~
@454  = ~So, how long did you stay in De'Arnise Keep when you were young?~
@455  = ~I'm not sure what you mean by that question, good elf.~
@456  = ~Were you not bored? Did you not grow tired of that stone fortress?~
@457  = ~Of course I did. Which is why I learned ways to sneak out of the walls many a time and in fact learned magic to aid me in my escapes.~
@458  = ~I was never so lucky. Even if I wanted to escape Evereska, I'd have been caught almost immediately by the Vale Guards.~
@459  = ~So you loved your home enough to not want to leave it. How is that unlucky?~
@460  = ~I suppose I may have tried to leave it if I knew that it weren't so well defEXITed.~
@461  = ~And, yet you have left it. After so many years. Do you miss it?~
@462  = ~Yes. I... No. I'm sorry. Let us continue. I can say no more.~
@463  = ~Alright, Erevain. As you wish.~
@464  = ~Sir Keldorn. How can you stand to wear such bulky and orange armor? Don't you just wish to take it off immediately?~
@465  = ~This is my family armor, passed down from generation to generation. I honor them by wearing it and besides, I'm more nimble in it than you'd normally think.~
@466  = ~(Puts his hands on the armor and pulls up) But, it's still so weighty. How can you stand it?~
@467  = ~Get your thieving hands off of me. This armor suits my family and I well enough. Not every armor is a shade of brown or green and elvenmade.~
@468  = ~But, they're so much more comfortable and beautiful don't you think?~
@469  = ~I do not and prefer my own. A sure way to disappoint an elven thief is surely to place large heavy items in their paths. Good day to you.~
@470  = ~Valygar, your stealth capabilities are impressive.~
@471  = ~I have also noticed that you seem to disappear fairly well Erevain.~
@472  = ~Thank you. As do you Valygar.~
@473  = ~Who taught you such skills.~
@474  = ~I learned it from the Greycloaks. Elves are the greatest masters of stealth. The cloak of elvenkind is highly sought by all races.~
@475  = ~Hmph. We'll see. I have heard of that cloak. Do you have one?~
@476  = ~No, and you aren't getting one either.~
@477  = ~I don't need it. My stealth is well enough developed. Come let us move on.~
@478  = ~Come Valygar, with your aptitude you would make an excellent mage. Let me teach you a simple spell.~
@479  = ~Another time perhaps.~
@480  = ~Come now Valygar. It's a waste for a man with so much magic in his veins do deny such a capability.~
@481  = ~Indulging in my magical heritage is what worries me the most.~
@482  = ~I remain ready to teach when your courage surfaces.~
@483  = ~I thank you Erevain.~
@484  = ~Mazzy, you are capable warrior.~
@485  = ~Thank you, good Erevain. But tell me what it is like to be an Elven Knight.~
@486  = ~Why do you ask my lady? Do you think me a knight?~
@487  = ~Almost good sir, you merely need a boost to yet become one should you wish. Surely though, you knew of some from your homeland?~
@488  = ~Yes, there were the Swords of Evereska, a group of Fighters, Wizards, and Paladins. I'm sure you would like them.~
@489  = ~I would! Tell me of them, what are they like? What tests and challenges do you have to face to join them?~
@490  = ~I'm sorry Mazzy. Let's talk about about something else.~
@491  = ~Good Erevain, I meant no offense. What was it that I said?~
@492  = ~Enough, enough. No more.~
@493  = ~Mazzy, do halflings ever dance in battle?~
@494  = ~What strange Elvish question is this? Why would my kind dance in battle?~
@495  = ~Sometimes it's entertaining to add additional twirls, flips, and thrusts while fighting your enemies.~
@496  = ~I assure you that halflings fight very hard to defEXIT themselves, their homes, and their families, they are not the least concerned about using such "flair".~
@497  = ~Halflings are so agile though! Not even a little somersault?~
@498  = ~Only if absolutely necessary.~
@499  = ~I'd love to see you perform one, Mazzy!~
@500  = ~Another time Erevain.~
@501  = ~Jaheira, have you ever wished that you were a full elf?~
@502  = ~Why would I wish to be anything than what I am?~
@503  = ~Well, you wouldn't be a half-breed. You would be free to roam the elven strongholds and city without escort.~
@504  = ~Stop, I care not for this arrogant prattle. Speak no more to me of this.~
@505  = ~Jaheira, would you say that half-elves are more likely to marry than full elves?~
@506  = ~Again, with this strain. What compels you to ask such arrogant questions? No, I do not believe half-elves marry more than elves. Have you ever been marriied.~
@507  = ~I... I do not want to answer that question.~
@508  = ~Oh mighty Erevain, why do you avoid the question?~
@509  = ~I simply do not want to answer it! It is inane.~
@510  = ~Oh, such a wise knowledgeable figure cannot answer a simple question.~
@511  = ~Grr...That's hardly fair Jaheira. No more questions! Let us be off.~
@512  = ~Yes, it is one to sling such barbs; it is another to receive them.~
@513  = ~Yoshimo, what is this gaze?~
@514  = ~I have watched you work Erevain and I am most impressed.~
@515  = ~Thank you, but what impressed you so much?~
@516  = ~Your sly skill of finding snares. I do such work to hide mine, and yet you consistently seem to find those of others. How do your eyes see so well?~
@517  = ~Natural skill enhanced by magic.~
@518  = ~Hah. Without such magics you are an inferior rogue no?~
@519  = ~Perhaps. I have much to learn and would do well to learn from one such as yourself. You display such skill in your trapmaking. I have no idea how you accomplish what you do.~
@520  = ~Well, Young Mantis. Your training begins now.~
@521  = ~I look forward to it.~
@522  = ~Yoshimo, show me some of your tricks.~
@523  = ~Young Mantis, come I have some tricks to show you that the tourists love... (Flips in the air with a mid-air kick before landing.) Hi-yo-cha!~
@524  = ~Alright, let me try... (Flips in the air with an awkward kick.) Hee-Oh-... (Erevain hits his face on the ground.)~
@525  = ~Ooh. That will leave a mark. Poor Mantis. Well. Best to get up and try again! Come, come Young Mantis!~
@526  = ~A Knight of the Order of the Radiant Heart eh? What compels you so much to join a lanky old organization like that?~
@527  = ~Watch your tongue elf. The Order is a most heroic organization that even rogues like yourself should be jealous of. Many a great deed hath been done its brave knights.~
@528  = ~The Swords of Evereska have prospered for far longer and served many a more people.~
@529  = ~Yes, I've heard of them. Noble deeds I'm sure, but for elves only. The Order of the Radiant Heart works for the good of all.~
@530  = ~The Swords of Evereska have done many a good as well. And actively seek out to help others.~
@531  = ~Other elves that is. If you can enter Evereska's Hidden Vale, which non-elves cannot visit. The Order of the Radiant Heart is open to all in seeking justice. Good intentions from your elven counterparts perhaps, but not in deeds.~
@532  = ~(Erevain remains silent.)~
@533  = ~Hmm. Thank you Erevain for your acknowledgement.~
@534  = ~Yes, Anomen?~
@535  = ~Watch yourself there. You look a bit rough after our last battle.~
@536  = ~Thank you Anomen for your help. You have yet a few skills that I do not possess. You are a worthy ally.~
@537  = ~I thank you Erevain. Many of my skills come from Helm's will and blessing.~
@538  = ~Nonetheless, still impressive. Despite my worship of Corellon, I have never been able to receive the divine magics.~
@539  = ~With just a little more piety, you could focus on a whole other set of abilities.~
@540  = ~Oh no. It is difficult enough dividing my current focus already. Besides, I have you friEXIT to aid me in that department.~
@541  = ~That you do Erevain. It is an honor to serve beside you.~
@542  = ~Yes, Jan?~
@543  = ~So, you're from Evereska Erevain?~
@544  = ~Yes I am.~
@545  = ~Well, I've been to Evereska before with my second great uncle once removed Numit.~
@546  = ~Jan, did you want to ask something?~
@547  = ~So, how is it being an elf Erevain?~
@548  = ~I am fine being an elf Jan.~
@549  = ~My third great uncle Nesmot was an elf for a long time. His large floppy ears made all the elven ladies swoon over and over after him. Unfortunately, male elves jealous of his ears stole his earwax one day and that was the EXIT of his run.~
@550  = ~Yes, elves without earwax is a great tragedy.~
@551  = ~It was. Nesmot's ears grew smaller and smaller and less pointy and less pointy. His confidence shrunk and so did his height. And, that's how Nesmot came back to the Jansens. He just didn't have the earwax to make it as an elf.~
@552  = ~Well. What an amazing story.~
@553  = ~Oh there's more to Nesmot's journey than that especially the time he met a mucousy medusae.~
@554  = ~I can't wait.~
@555  = ~I never got to tell you the story of my third great uncle Nesmot and the mucousy medusae did I?~
@556  = ~No Jan. We are all really longing to hear it.~
@557  = ~Well, be long no more elven friEXIT. You see Nesmot had just a regular inferior nose that most races like yourself have.~
@558  = ~Excuse me?~
@559  = ~It's simply a fact that Gnomes truly have the best schnozzes in the whole crystal sphere. Nesmot's nose unfortunately could not make par. After a bit too much to drink, Nesmot EXITed up in the clutches of a medusa and a maedar. The snake lovers got into an argument and upon seeing Nesmot's puny nose and the maedar's handsome one, the medusa wanted to punish her mate. The medusa quickly turned them both into stone, chopped their noses off and switched them out before returning them to flesh again. The maedar was weepingly furious but ol Nesmot was dancing as happy as could be. His new giant green nose was the talk of the town and all the gnomish ladies now swooned for him.~
@560  = ~Wait what about the mucous?~
@561  = ~Oh yes, well you see that maedar nose while handsome had a real sneezing problem. Nesmot gathered all the mucous and donated it to others and they too saw their noses grow and grow and grow.~
@562  = ~Big and green?~
@563  = ~At first. Though the green color eventually muted out. The big noses spread like ketchup seeds and that's how gnomes got their beautiful schnozzes.~
@564  = ~Yes, HaerDalis~
@565  = ~Tell me Erevain, in what ways do elves of your ilk occupy themselves with acting and the performing arts?~
@566  = ~We have several elven festivals where actors and actresses play out the parts of gods in ancient tales or as important elven monarchs and figures of the past.~
@567  = ~What about new plays? New stories? New tales?~
@568  = ~I can't say those are generally told in the format that you're most fond of.~
@569  = ~How unfortunate. When did elves become so boring. Wouldn't you like to be able to play a king? A beggar, a guard, a vigilante, a lover?~
@570  = ~Elves live a lot longer than most humanoids Haer'Dalis. We already get to play so many roles in a lifetime.~
@571  = ~But, you can't play all of them.~
@572  = ~That's what magic is for. Become a man or a woman. Or a human or halfling and so forth.~
@573  = ~Hmm. Most peculiar. Even such magics cannot substitute the immense feeling of truly becoming something other than yourself. You should take some time and try art of acting yourself.~
@574  = ~Perhaps I shall.~
@575  = ~HaerDalis, did you want to ask something?~
@576  = ~So my Leopard, how dost thou fare on this fine day.~
@577  = ~Leopard? Really? Why am I a leopard?~
@578  = ~You are quick, light, and graceful, but also a deadly enemy skilled in ambushes and quick strikes!~
@579  = ~Well thank you Haer'Dalis. I shall have to find an animal to call you by.~
@580  = ~But, I have such a name already, Sparrow.~
@581  = ~I don't think that name suits you well.~
@582  = ~I've played the Sparrow for a long time!~
@583  = ~I think you'd be much better as a Black-capped Chickadee. A confused darkly bird that doesn't know what it is.~
@584  = ~That is much too long a name! No, no no! Sparrow is my animal!~
@585  = ~Cernd, did you want to ask something?~
@586  = ~I have always wondered why so few elves find their calling within druidic circles.~
@587  = ~I suppose that's because elves already have a close tie to nature.~
@588  = ~I suppose many races do, but unlike many others they weave so much of their life and magic into preserving and enhancing their natural surroundings.~
@589  = ~Well...er....um...~
@590  = ~I've heard many tales of elven cities. So wondrous! Such an exquisite testament to nature's beauty!~
@591  = ~Cernd.. I think I...~
@592  = ~I know! You have likely seen such cities in your life before. Surely, compared to those, most other locales must be so bland! Erevain, wait, why are you leaving?~
@593  = ~Yes, Cernd?~
@594  = ~Out of all the talents you could have developed. Why did you never develop one for nature's magic?~
@595  = ~I don't know Cernd. Why didn't you ever develop a talent for egg balancing?~
@596  = ~I'm being serious Erevain. The magic that druids use is very special and I'm surprised that someone who has spent so much time in their life being around nature doesn't interest in its inmost wondrous workings.~
@597  = ~Oh, I am being serious, Cernd. Look at me! (Balances an egg on his nose with his head lifted up while standing on one foot.) Pretty impressive huh?~
@598  = ~Oh never mind.~
@599  = ~Yes, Korgan?~
@600  = ~So Erevain, how many elves can ya scewer o'er a fire?~
@601  = ~Leave me be with your foul humor.~
@602  = ~Ah come on. Have'a sense of humor. How many elves can ya scewer o'er a fire?~
@603  = ~(Sigh) I don't know.~
@604  = ~Not many 'cause they ain't got much meat on'em! Har! Har! Har!~
@605  = ~That's both crude and unfunny.~
@606  = ~Bah, you ain't got any better.~
@607  = ~None of your kind surely.~
@608  = ~Korgan, did you want to ask something?~
@609  = ~How do ya like my ears, elf!~
@610  = ~Ugh. They don't match your color.~
@611  = ~That's true I s' pose. Still I picked them myself an prettied them up as best as I could.~
@612  = ~You... got those from living drow didn't you?~
@613  = ~Well, they weren't quite living after my axe tore straight through their gullet!~
@614  = ~Yes, I think I will take my leave now.~
@615  = ~Bah. You tain't no fun! You of all races should be'a happy ta see dead drow ears!~
@616  = ~Korgan, stop staring at me!~
@617  = ~Do you know why I don't like elves.~
@618  = ~Because we're refined, elegant, and articulate unlike you Korgan?~
@619  = ~Na. It's cause you're humorless spinless fools who don't have anything useful to say that isn't wrapped up in some poff'ery of undeserved importance.~
@620  = ~Hah. Elves are probably one of the most fun loving races out there. Singing, dancing, music, and drinking are things that every elf loves.~
@621  = ~Drinking? Bah. Those pathetic Elven wines don't taste right or do anything for real intoxication.~
@622  = ~Yes, I suppose dwarves like you only care for drinking and not for anything else remotely interesting. Take a look at these moves. (Twists around in a rapid spinning motion, flips over landing with feet angled toward the sky, clicks heels together while raising one arm to the side and another straight up) Woo! Now that is a dance move!~
@623  = ~Pardon while I go salt my eyes.~
@624  = ~Yes, Viconia?~
@625  = ~So, tell me lost little elf. Why is it again that you left home so long ago? Mommy and Daddy weren't nice to you?~
@626  = ~You Drow are a mockery of everything decent. Why do you purposefully seek to torment me like this?~
@627  = ~Touched a soft nerve have I, poor darthiir? I'll try to be more careful about your delicate nature.~
@628  = ~Don't speak to me again, saurar! If I have to use a spell to hide from you, so be it.~
@629  = ~I'll see you hiding, poor elfling. Drow eyes see clearly in the darkness.~
@630  = ~How exactly does that work? One must have light in order to see!~
@631  = ~I shall reveal no such secrets to you, darthiir.~
@632  = ~I shall find out soon enough, saurar!~
@633  = ~Edwin, stop staring at me!~
@634  = ~Tell me my confused companion. Why do you spEXIT your talents in three directions? Wouldn't it be ease your monkey brain to focus on fewer EXITeavors.~
@635  = ~I never really fit into just one category. I got bored being just a Fighter or just a Mage or just a Thief. I found that I had multiple aptitudes. Don't you get tired of doing the same thing Edwin?~
@636  = ~The same thing?! A Red Wizard does far more than just one thing! A Conjurer does far more than than just one thing!~
@637  = ~Yes, but you just summon more things right? A few more hobgoblins, an extra ogre here and there.~
@638  = ~(These miserable simians know nothing.) Your knowledge of magic is so fractured, you're likely to throw your sword thinking that's casting a spell.~
@639  = ~You're right Edwin. I really am just so scatterbrained that I can't properly understand magic.~
@640  = ~Oooh. You are a little smarter than I thought. Perhaps you can graduate from gorilla to orangutan.~
@641  = ~Hey, Edwin, what's that over there?~
@642  = ~Does your small brain think that I will actually fall for that trick? (Always with these pompous monkeys.)~
@643  = ~Actually you already have. Look behind you.~
@644  = ~You senile simian, I will not fall for... My Necklace! Why is it on the ground!~
@645  = ~Actually it's right here in my pocket see?~
@646  = ~GAH! Give me both of those! Which one is the real one! (Thieving monkeys. I will cut their little digits off one by one.)~
@647  = ~So Edwin, why become a Conjurer? Why not an Invoker or Transmuter for instance?~
@648  = ~A regular mage? (Pathetic simple simians unable to comprehEXIT.) A Conjurer is anything but irregular. Truly valuable is a specialist who can complete their magic to its highest form. Not some pathetic generalist who isn't good at anything.~
@649  = ~I take offense to that Edwin. I am quite an accomplished good mage.~
@650  = ~Bah. (Imbecilic monkeys thinking they understand the Art.) Your powers are even more diluted! I would gladly take any other mage, even a pathetic generalist, instead of you.~
@651  = ~My power is far more than the sum of my individual parts as you should already know Edwin. And perhaps I'll be a little less generous protecting you next time.~
@652  = ~I do not need your protection elf. I am well powerful enough on my own.~
@653  = ~Then why do stand in the back Edwin? I can just as well lead and bear the front assaults.~
@654  = ~Yes, you are right. Powerful Erevain lead away. (Let the simple simian bear the harm instead of me.)~
@655  = ~So Sarevok, have any regrets in your life?~
@656  = ~I have few regrets and will not share them with the likes of you.~
@657  = ~Come now Sarevok. How can you learn and grow if you don't talk about our mistakes.~
@658  = ~It is beyond pointless to discuss what could have been instead of what is.~
@659  = ~Pointless perhaps, but you didn't say that you were without regrets.~
@660  = ~Leave me be elf. I have no use for your pretentious prattling nor would I share such things with your intrusive ears.~
@661  = ~But Sarevok are you...~
@662  = ~LEAVE ME BE ELF!~
@663  = ~Yes, Shar-Tell?~
@664  = ~Do not look my way elfling.~
@665  = ~I'm not looking your way at all.~
@666  = ~I tolerate your pathetic elfhood only because of <CHARNAME>. Cross the line and your gullet will be spewed tenfold over.~
@667  = ~Tell me of your heritage Shar-Teel. You came from Baldur's Gate, yes?~
@668  = ~Ask someone else Erevain. I do not talk to poor male elflings.~
@669  = ~Rude amazons don't have much clout in greater Faerun. I am sure that everyone else tires of hearing your rubbish threats.~
@670  = ~Keep your pathetic elfling mouth shut or I'll cut it out of you, <CHARNAME> willing or not.~
@671  = ~I would skewer my own family for such words, much less so an imbecile as you.~
@672  = ~Shar-Teel, what's the matter?~
@673  = ~I told you before to place your pathetic gaze elsewhere. This is your last warning elfling!~
@674  = ~Oh just shut up! I long tire of your baseless threats. I wasn't looking your way and even the most perverted Calimshite would never be tempted to look your way.~
@675  = ~That's it! (Shar-Teel kicks Erevain in the groin).~
@676  = ~Aaagh!~
@677  = ~Next time, you'll be dead.~
@678  = ~I can attack more locations than just the front.~
@679  = ~How do you feel about your people Dar?~
@680  = ~My people?~
@681  = ~Yes, orcs. Those savages that pillage and kill civilized beings including the elves, my people.~
@682  = ~I am unlike those orcs. I was raised by priests of Ilmater to be kind, just, and merciful.~
@683  = ~A spider is still a spider and cannot overcome its nature.~
@684  = ~I hope to prove my nature as a noble one.~
@685  = ~How many times have you beaten someone or stolen property Dar?~
@686  = ~I do not understand. Ilmater forbids such behavior.~
@687  = ~That doesn't matter. Orcs are murderous thieving mongrels. Thugs - all of them. So I ask you again, how many times have you beaten someone or stole property?~
@688  = ~I have never stolen anything nor harmed any innocents.~
@689  = ~A spider is still a spider.~
@690  = ~You've been very loyal to the group Dar.~
@691  = ~Such is the teaching of Ilmater and my nature.~
@692  = ~(Thinks a moment) Yes, perhaps you are different. I thank you Dar.~
@693  = ~Your welcome. As always, I shall serve to do good in the world.~
@694  = ~Do Tempurans have any major festivals that they celebrate?~
@695  = ~Why do you ask such a question Erevain?~
@696  = ~I miss the Lateu'quor. It roughly translates in the common tongue as the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon. It has the most beautiful sight you'd ever see. Exquisite dancing, drinking, music, and art of all kinds. Rarely, Corellon bestows a special gift at these celebrations: A piece of Art, a Harp, or even a suit of Armor.~
@697  = ~My, that's impressive.~
@698  = ~It is. In fact, this sword was one of the gifts on one of those rare nights. The Feywarden of Corellon chose me to receive it.~
@699  = ~Out of all the elves of Evereska, why were you chosen for that honor?~
@700  = ~I do not know. To this day I do not know. My brothers and cousins were so jealous. The sword has served me well though.~
@701  = ~I envy you Erevain of Corellon; I hope that Tempus will honor me in such a way one day.~
@702  = ~I have no doubt that He shall!~
@703  = ~Yes, Accalia?~
@704  = ~Corellon seemed to favor you for some reason.~
@705  = ~True, yes.~
@706  = ~Yet, how many more priests of Corellon never received his direct favor in that way.~
@707  = ~Yes, I suppose. But, the gods can't favor all of their servants can they? Else, favored wouldn't mean anything right?~
@708  = ~But why is it that many times the god's most devoted servants are not among the god's first chosen?~
@709  = ~I'm sure that Tempus favors plenty of his priests. Why do you doubt that Tempus does not favor you? You seem to have done quite well. Tempus does grant you spells does he not?~
@710  = ~He does. I suppose that I can be impatient at times. I want to do great things to honor Tempus and his church.~
@711  = ~I'm sure that you shall and I shall be here to assist.~
@712  = ~(Smiles) Thank you Erevain.~
@713  = ~Accalia, we talked before, but you never told me about the Tempuran festivals.~
@714  = ~Once per year, Tempurans celebrate the Feast of the Moon. On that day under the full moonlight, we have a large feast accompanied by a set of rituals and prayers honoring the fallen warriors and paying tribute to the fallen warriors to come. Sometimes the children put on plays reliving famous battles.~
@715  = ~That sounds gruesome.~
@716  = ~(Glares at Erevain) The weapons are blunted and precautions are made to ensure that none of the child actors are hurt. (Smiles) In fact, one year as a child I got to play as Tempus himself fully hidden and concealed behind a helmet and riding on two ponies representing his steeds, Veiros and Deiros. It was frightening to be wearing such heavy armor and having to stand with one foot on each of the two ponies, but was nonetheless thrilling and great fun.~
@717  = ~I suppose that sounds like fun, but you couldn't play as any famous female warrior or heroine?~
@718  = ~The boy who was supposed to portray Tempus hurt his back and we needed a quick replacement. Since I was about the same stature, they chose me for the role. Tempus has never been known to speak directly on Faerun. So, the role was silent which also suited me well.~
@719  = ~That's nice, but I still think that it's a shame that your "fun" had to involve you becoming a man.~
@720  = ~It is a great honor to portray Tempus. Tempus is the most sublime heroic deities that Faerun who has armed and defEXITed these lands for hundreds of years. I would gladly become Tempus, man or not and am honored to have him as my deity.~
@721  = ~And you thought that you weren't favored? It seems that Tempus is equally fortunate to have such a devoted priestess as you.~
@722  = ~(Laughs) You are right Erevain. I should be more mindful of Tempus's blessings.~
@723  = ~Absolutely, afterall, he brought us together with Hrothgar and <CHARNAME>. I'm sure we'll find even greater glories that you can pen in Tempus's honor.~
@724  = ~(Smiles) Yes indeed. Let us continue.~
@725  = ~Why out of all the Ten Towns, did you choose Easthaven, Hrothgar?~
@726  = ~Easthaven seemed the best fit for me. It was and still is quite comfortable with enough friEXITly neighbors. Why have you Erevain never settled down in all your travels?~
@727  = ~I love to travel. I want to see all of Abeir-Toril across and within.~
@728  = ~Where did you get your unique crossbow, "Big Shoota" from?~
@729  = ~I got it while saving a Gnome family from Nelanther pirates.~
@730  = ~Tell me more, I'd love to hear the tale.~
@731  = ~Perhaps another time. I do not feel much in the mood at the moment.~
@732  = ~How did you acquire those items?~
@733  = ~What items are you referring to?~
@734  = ~The moonblade and the elven chain. Whom did you steal or kill to retrieve those?~
@735  = ~Why do you get off accusing people of such horrible things? I have done no such thing.~
@736  = ~Those items are not shared with non-elves. They are created specifically for the Tel-quessir, not half-breeds like you.~
@737  = ~Such vile rudeness Erevain. You are no better than the majority of humans who persecute me.~
@738  = ~Call me what you wish, but I have no patience for the theft of elven artifacts.~
@739  = ~Leave me alone! Do not speak to me of this again. It is a wonder how <CHARNAME> tolerates your poison tongue.~
@740  = ~You never did tell me how you got that moonblade and armor.~
@741  = ~I told you not to speak to me of these things again! Why do you torment me so! I have done nothing wrong.~
@742  = ~If you have done nothing wrong then why can't you say how you got them! You wouldn't want family heirlooms in unlawful hands would you!~
@743  = ~These items were given to me after my mother's death! I...didn't know about it for many months. They are among the few remnants that are left of my mother's life.~
@744  = ~Yes, it does seem that the moonblade has not rejected you. Else, you would not be able to even lift it. Your ability to wear that armor does seem to suggest a familial fit. Your mother was an elf?~
@745  = ~Yes Erevain.~
@746  = ~It is still highly irregular for such precious items to transfer to a half-breed. But, your words are likely true.~
@747  = ~Would you stop calling me a half-breed! I am a full-blooded woman with a heart, mind, and soul! I used to have loving parents who EXITured a lot of hardship and you would do well to remember that.~
@748  = ~I... have a family as well. I am sorry. Let us be off.~
@749  = ~Whta's the matter, Melora?~
@750  = ~I'm not sure what to think of you Erevain. A corrupt male mage like most of them, but a skilled thief as well.~
@751  = ~If you weren't so closed-minded, you'd benefit from the Art and aid your own rogue skills.~
@752  = ~I don't need any of that filthy magic to help me. I do more than well enough on my own.~
@753  = ~Then I am sure you will remain small in more ways than one.~
@754  = ~Watch your tongue elf. I would chuck any undeserving male to the Nine Hells if they deserved it. Don't push yourself further into that category.~
@755  = ~Oh, Erevan Ilesere, hide me from this insane halfling!~
@756  = ~Yes, Melora?~
@757  = ~You did fairly well in that last battle.~
@758  = ~Thank you.~
@759  = ~For filthy male mage that is.~
@760  = ~You surely have a strong grudge against male mages for reasons totally alien!~
@761  = ~It's not my fault that men betray their lovers and use magic to hide their misdeeds.~
@762  = ~I have done no such thing.~
@763  = ~Sure ya haven't. No one believes liars who charm ladies with their magic and then just as the spell fades away tosses those same ladies away.~
@764  = ~There is room for a healthy awareness of magic. I am sorry if such things happened to you.~
@765  = ~Sorry doesn't do a lick for me Erevain. What my father did to my mother is long past.~
@766  = ~If we ever find your father, I will aid you in your revenge.~
@767  = ~Thank you Erevain.~
@768  = ~Yes, Taffic?~
@769  = ~Why did you say earlier that I could not become an elf? It is my destiny to become great!~
@770  = ~A N-Tel-Quess cannot become a Tel-quessir~
@771  = ~What in Toril is that supposed to mean.~
@772  = ~(Sigh) A gnome cannot simply become an elf.~
@773  = ~How closed-minded of you! Such magics are very possible! We must find a mage with the proper skill.~
@774  = ~Taking the form of an elf does not make you an elf. The elven spirit and soul are alien things to that of other races.~
@775  = ~Well, perhaps I shall find a suitable elven spirit and soul to complement my form and you will help me.~
@776  = ~I most certainly will not. To steal those from a living elf or to petition for a new soul and spirit to go to a N-Tel-Quess would be an abomination to Corellon.~
@777  = ~You're just greedy, wanting all the greatness for yourself. <CHARNAME> will help me and I will become great. You just watch!~
@778  = ~A demon? Are you unmistakably convinced?~
@779  = ~Of course. I was clearly meant to become great through evolving into a powerful demon.~
@780  = ~Demons are the tortured souls of horrific mortals transformed into an evil nightmarish form and doomed to serve as pawns of their cruel overlords. Why in the Gray Waste would you want that for yourself?~
@781  = ~What are you talking about I just want to become a demon, not actually die!~
@782  = ~Don't you think there might be some problem in trying to become a demon without any of the drawbacks?~
@783  = ~Such foolishness Erevain. You have no confidence in the Art you yourself practice. You stay a weak elf Erevain; I'm going to become a powerful demon. You just watch.~
@784  = ~Oh Sehanine! Save me from this madness.~
@785  = ~Sime, why Mielikki out of all the deities you could worship.~
@786  = ~Mielikki was always generous to me, protected the innocent, and served the good of nature.~
@787  = ~Surely, Corellon Larethian or Rillifane Rallathil does all of that and more no?~
@788  = ~I suppose I do not know. I am not very familiar with the Elven gods.~
@789  = ~I'm very surprised. Surely you would have come across many an elf to teach you yes?~
@790  = ~Mielikki guides me to protect the forests and the good creatures of the land and not toward any kind of creature in particular.~
@791  = ~My my. Well, I shall do my best to instruct you about how elves bring about the best in nature.~
@792  = ~Yes, Sime?~
@793  = ~So Erevain I have listened to your talks on the beauty of elven culture, nature, and so forth many a time now.~
@794  = ~Yes, and?~
@795  = ~I feel that many of your people have lost their way.~
@796  = ~How so?~
@797  = ~Your elven kindred have built themselves grand cities and try to erect them in harmony with nature nature.~
@798  = ~Yes, of course. That harmony is one of our major accomplishments.~
@799  = ~However, even so many of your people seem to have lost touch with nature itself, spEXITing their time dealing with the foibles of civilization.~
@800  = ~Foibles? Music, art, poetry, and beautiful craftsmanship of all kinds!~
@801  = ~While beautiful, it takes your people away from the beauty of nature. The only ones among you that still appreciate it fully seem to be the Wild Elves.~
@802  = ~What? My barely dressed, tattooed, covered in mud cousins? No, when I meet them in my journeys they shall be warmly welcomed but from a distance and not touched.~
@803  = ~You wish to claim a closeness to nature yet you wish not to be close even to your kin.~
@804  = ~Yes, I think a healthy distance from the dirt and stink of nature is quite appropriate.~
@805  = ~(Moves around uncomfortably) Perhaps we can discuss this later.~
@806  = ~Kachiko, why is it that you favor the Katana so. Surely, you must agree that the longsword is truly the finest blade.~
@807  = ~Katanas are made by the most dedicated weaponsmiths in Kara-Tur. The time required to create them is extraordinary and the crafstmanship of a Katana is unparalleled.~
@808  = ~(Pulls out a longsword) Look at that Kachiko. Behold this magnificent elven make. Far finer than what could be made elsewhere.~
@809  = ~Perhaps we must live with our disagreements unless you were willing to put our blades to the test?~
@810  = ~No, certainly not. I would not spill the blood of a good woman over a petty dispute.~
@811  = ~(Nods and smiles) Nor would I likewise with a good man.~
@812  = ~Are there any elves in Kara-Tur?~
@813  = ~There are extremely few if any at all in Kara-Tur.~
@814  = ~Are you absolutely positive? It is hard for me to believe that the Tel-quessir would not travel to every reach of Abeir-Toril.~
@815  = ~Well, hmm. I have heard of something you might call a "Star Elf". Some legEXITs have been told of tall fey creatures like yourself with star diadems that have come to trade occasionally on the outer west rim of my homeland. I've never seen any evidence of them myself mind you.~
@816  = ~Fascinating. Perhaps one day I can journey that way with you and we can verify these legEXITs and find my lost cousins.~
@817  = ~(Nods)~
