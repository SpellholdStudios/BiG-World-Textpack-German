@1    = ~If you say so. But if you’d try to smile you’d look prettier.~
@2    = ~Let’s see... turn around, Aerie. Well, not completely. If one does not see your face you are quite nice looking. Too fragile and bony may be, but some like it.~
@3    = ~Puffy eyes, red twitching nose, trembling lips...~ [SIMEAE02]
@4    = ~(*shrugs*) And I thought I was improving things.~
@5    = ~Aerie, here you are! Why are you always lagging behind?~ [SIMEAE03]
@6    = ~Princess, you need not measure your every step. We are not on a raft, you will not slip. And the floor under our feet is not covered with broken glass and spikes.~ [SIMEAE04]
@7    = ~Aerie, I reckon that you spent many years on the ground.~
@8    = ~I am sorry, Aerie. I could not have imagined that anyone might be uncomfortable on the solid ground.~
@9    = ~But why, Aerie?~
@10   = ~<CHARNAME>! Do you mind if we walk more slowly? I would rather not be sweating and puffing if we run into an enemy!~
@11   = ~Do not look at me!~
@12   = ~Aerie, what are you doing? What is this? Let me take a look at this vial.~
@13   = ~Give me that vial.~

@15   = ~(*Sniffs the bottle carefully*)... <CHARNAME>! Hold her! Silly child.~
@16   = ~She is... faint?~
@17   = ~What, I have nothing better to do than run after hysterical girls? She will come back. Sime, she fainted!~
@18   = ~You caught her? Good. Please, hold her tight while I purge her body from poison.~
@19   = ~Poison? Aerie poisoned herself? I do not understand. Is not it regarded as a mortal sin among elves? Why, Aerie, why?~
@20   = ~As if we do not have enough troubles already. She is unaccustomed to the trials of adventurer’s life. I should not have allowed her to follow... us.~
@21   = ~Do you think that she did it because of...~
@22   = ~It is because of you and me, <CHARNAME>, do not you see? She is in love with you.~
@23   = ~I hope she will be alright. I will talk to her and I will try to explain... I do not know how yet, but I will try. I do not wish our future to be clouded by this child’s tears.~
@24   = ~Because of me? My poor gentle Aerie! Sime, I am sorry, but I think my eyes are finally opened. I love Aerie.~
@25   = ~She is waking up. I will leave you now. Whatever you want to say should be said in private. I do not think she would want me around.~
@26   = ~I see. Know <CHARNAME>, that I will not ask you for your love again. It looks that you find a good place for it. But hid my advice, tell her how I loved you. The foolish ones hold the sense of victory in more esteem than the tenderness of the first days together. When you would spend the last penny of your happiness with your sweetheart, on the night of my triumph, do not come to me! I will not know you. And how will I be able to help? I would not know how to heal the happiness.~
@27   = ~To follow YOU, that’s what you wanted to say. It is because of you and me, <CHARNAME>, let’s face it. She is in love with you.~
@28   = ~Aerie, I wanted to talk to you.~
@29   = ~Not enough, I am afraid. I can sense your distress and I want to help you.~
@30   = ~I cannot make <CHARNAME> to love you. I cannot make anybody to love anybody. And you cannot either. But love is not a prison, Aerie. Love is wings. Even love which is unreturned.~
@31   = ~I do. Listen to me and do not shut your heart. It’s like a port: one ship enters while another leaves. In few years you will not be able to remember his name, too much in love with another man to care.~
@32   = ~(*smiles*) Of course, dear. But just in case, remember what I told you: do not shut your heart.~
@33   = ~Greed and lust, nothing else! Even your bravery is a commendable thing. For it is born in a cold heart.~ [SIMEKO01]

@64   = ~I must apologize then for calling you a twit.~
@65   = ~Because you are not a twit, my young Lord, but a lunatic. A sweet lunatic, who believes his own lies!~ [SIMEAN02]
@66   = ~Who told you that I am a noble born Lady, Anomen? I am a thief’s daughter.~
@67   = ~She was an Elf, Anomen that’s all I know. Her origin is a mystery to me.~
@68   = ~I strongly doubt it, Anomen. And frankly, I would not want it.~
@69   = ~You look very upset, knight. What is your grievance?~ [SIMEAN03]
@70   = ~You do not like our adventuring company?~
@71   = ~You like us... That’s very kind and generous of you, my heroic knight. Yet why does it bring you pain to like your comrades at arms?~ [SIMEAN04]
@72   = ~Seems to me that you enjoy adventuring, Anomen. We might not draw from the pool of light, but we do good things...~
@73   = ~I am afraid I cannot agree with you. I would choke if I were a subject to proper discipline and the Order’s structure. I’d rather ask my heart what to do, than my superior.~
@74   = ~(*brushes her long blond hair and looks thoughtful*)~
@75   = ~(*sighs*) Was she a blonde?~
@76   = ~An old artist?~
@77   = ~I am afraid you’ve lost me, Jan. Why would Amalia marry a turnip merchant?~

@80   = ~Sorry, Jan, I absolutely have to interrupt you. I have a date and I do not want to be late. Good night!~
@81   = ~Jan, may I see it? I am pretty sure you were carving that turnip.~
@82   = ~Hmm, seems to me that I err in looking at the tall knights and noble rangers for a romance. If you are capable of see a blushing maiden in a highly prosaic vegetable, you must have a heart of a poet, Jan.~
@83   = ~Good for your Cousin Willy!~
@84   = ~I get the picture, Jan. How clever! I bet that not a single critic was able to read the whole title from the beginning to the end.~
@85   = ~Paper and bread? Dare I ask...  No, forget it! Let’s catch up with the rest, Jan.~
@86   = ~Your smile conveys that you know more than you are willing to tell, Yoshimo. Why do you watch me and smile?~ [SIMEYO01]
@87   = ~Mayhap, but no, not this time. I know all sorts of men’s glances. Yours is not that of an admirer.~
@88   = ~I speak my mind openly, Yoshimo and rarely do I play games.~
@89   = ~More often than not I am afraid to know the thoughts of Aran. My answer to you is that I simply do not know. And it is an honest one. But why should there be any special interest? <CHARNAME> paid for his assistance.~
@90   = ~You cannot call me Aran’s ally! I am no Shadow Thief! I argue with Aran every single minute I spend with him! I disagree with everything he is doing!~ [SIMEYO02]
@91   = ~True. But it does not mean that he confides in me.~
@92   = ~You are a calm and composed man, Yoshimo. A dangerous man. You are one of the best in the profession I have seen.~ [SIMEYO03]
@93   = ~If a compliment, than a watery one. A pity that you chose to be a thief, and did not apply your considerable talents in another field.~ [SIMEYO04]
@94   = ~Aye, I did. They were dreamers and died quickly. A thief’s path is a displeasing one for an honorable person.~
@95   = ~That’s all tales!~
@96   = ~A very small grain.~
@97   = ~I wonder how you could live in that somber place. Do not you ever get chilly? I do not like closed spaces.~ [SIMENA01]
@98   = ~I am unfortunate when I have a roof over my head, other than starry skies. But tell me, are you going to do something about this guilt or are you going to savor it?~ [SIMENA02]
@99   = ~Nalia, this is a brave enterprise. You will need a lot of support, though. Let me know if you can use an extra helping hand.~
@100  = ~May be it’s for the best that the Castle is gone, Nalia? The Castle was a rather somber place. I would be chilly and lost in those endless dark chambers. I do not like closed spaces.~ [SIMENA03]
@101  = ~Come, Nalia! Our walls and arches are the tree trunks and our carpet is the glen full of flowers. Do you not breathe easier here? And aren’t you surrounded by friends?~
@102  = ~Nalia, I am astounded by your plans. Indeed it is a pity that you have not got the time to bring it to life. But you will always be a charitable person, no matter you own a Castle or not. Besides, things turn around and you might get the Castle back yet!~
@103  = ~Do I have my cloak inside out, Nalia? Or is it something else about my humble persona that makes you look so puzzled?~ [SIMENA04]
@104  = ~Oh, you are surprised by my city grab? *Laughs * I find little to my liking in Athkatla, Nalia. I might as well enjoy what I can. Crimson cloak in a forest might serve one purpose only.~
@105  = ~It attracts bandits splendidly.~
@106  = ~An illusion which does not live long.~ [SIMENA05]
@107  = ~I am most pleased to be introduced to you, Lady Mazzy. I have heard the most favorable things about you and your group.~ [SIMEMA01]
@108  = ~I grief with you. I know from my own experiences that one’s own wound does not hurt as much as those of friends’.~
@109  = ~I have not always been a loner, Mazzy. Once I roamed the forests and dales with a company of brave friends. We were so young and restless and we almost believed ourselves immortal. But the fates decreed otherwise. So I am a loner now. With a glass of good wine I wish to toast every one of them!~
@110  = ~To Kilendil, whose arrows ever hit the mark!~ [SIMEMA02]
@111  = ~What is your weapon of choice, Mazzy?~ [SIMEMA04]
@112  = ~Yes, it is.~
@113  = ~You are right, Mazzy. My clerical persuasion does not allow me to wield a sharpened blade. That does not mean that I cannot appreciate the weapon.~
@114  = ~(*laughs*) Unless it is a Mordenkainen’s Sword.~
@115  = ~A dangerous toy nonetheless. Have you ever heard about the wizard who lost control over one of those blades? They say he made three full circles around the city’s wall, the sword on his heels, before the blade got dispelled.~ [SIMEMA05]
@116  = ~Yes, sometimes these things have mind of their own. Wondrous nonetheless.~
@117  = ~I am the daughter of Aran Linvail, Viconia. His only daughter.~ [SIMEVI01]
@118  = ~In the Guild there are no inherited positions, Viconia. Should I want to advance I would start to work my way up from the streets and it would be my cunning which would promote me. But I have no desire to be connected with Shadow Thieves.~
@119  = ~Those who treat a ranger like rubbish are generally those who cry the loudest for his or her help in the time of need.~ [SIMEVI02]
@120  = ~I think this conversation is over, Viconia. You will never understand my motives, I will never understand yours.~
@121  = ~You abandoned the way of Lloth. Not for any kinder deity I may say, but still, you did. How many are like you among the Drow, Viconia?~ [SIMEVI03]
@122  = ~ I heard tales about Drizzt, and you have mentioned that your brother was a deviant as well. You fled to the surface and now live by your own rules. Which leads me to believe that a renegade Drow is not such an uncommon thing. Surely, there are others.~
@123  = ~I know your people’s "ways"! I have seen babes and women slain without pity by their sharp blades. I have seen the results of a Drow raid! How can a being that presumably has heart to commit deeds of such cruelty?~
@124  = ~That would be adopting the way of the Drow, Viconia. Drow who will not hesitate to cut an Elf’s throat no question’s asked.~ [SIMEVI04]
@125  = ~(*Wakes up with a startle*)... What is it? Viconia!~
@126  = ~That wicked bitch tried to stab me, that’s all.~
@127  = ~Well, walk it then, <CHARNAME>, but watch your step. For you might accidentally end up in Abyss.~
@128  = ~I am not about to cease breathing yet, <CHARNAME>. It left unpleasant taste in my mouth, but for your love I am ready to endure worst things.~
@129  = ~The world is a small place, Kachiko! Could I imagine that I would be talking to a Kara-Turian one day?~ [SIMEKA01]
@130  = ~You are right, of course there are plenty of those for whom stepping over the threshold is an adventure. Not the sort of adventure I dream of.~
@131  = ~I do not think I would derive satisfaction from a road walked only in my mind.~
@132  = ~You grew up in a large family, did you not, Kachiko?~ [SIMEKA02]
@133  = ~I am an only child. I always wanted to have a sibling.~
@134  = ~My father has been befriending only one certain type of women ever since my mother’s death. The sort which do not stay with one man for long and who would not carry a child.~
@135  = ~I am not bitter, I just. . .I think that Aran believes that it will save him from pain.~ [SIMEKA03]
@136  = ~No, I do not. He is wedging the knife deeper in his wound and twisting it, causing himself more pain and more sorrow. I told him that many times, but he would not listen. He will understand one day, but it will be too late.~
@137  = ~I have been watching you for a time, Imoen. You look troubled. Are you hurting?~ [SIMEIM01]
@138  = ~I guess I have an advantage of knowing a lot about you in advance, Imoen. <CHARNAME> spoke often of you.~
@139  = ~On the contrary, <PRO_HESHE> praised your youthful and cheerful spirit, Imoen. I was awaiting to meet you. By Mielikki, we have enough gloom around us. Sad and grim is our business. We can use a ray of sunshine, like your smile.~
@140  = ~Do not listen to Jaheira. She is a bore!~
@141  = ~What is it, Imoen? (*whispering*) Ah, what are you doing? Pick-pocketing other’s people clothes! You cannot...~ [SIMEIM02]
@142  = ~No, not really! Well, may be a little bit. Oh, damn you, Imoen now you’ve piqued my curiosity. Let me see!~ [SIMEIM03]
@143  = ~Oh, I thought it was not natural!~
@144  = ~I wonder if he ever read it?   He’s obviously never read it.~
@145  = ~Any initials on it?~
@146  = ~Rats!~
@147  = ~Oh, no big surprise there. Almost every Order member has a set of pornographic drawings.~
@148  = ~Always on duty.~
@149  = ~You are wasting your time counting them! I am sure he has at least two dozens.~
@150  = ~He must have guessed that you are in a habit of snooping around, Imoen.~
@151  = ~I am guessing Yoshimo’s mane is missing it!~
@152  = ~She was saying something about rebuilding the property earlier.~
@153  = ~He must be one of those who quits, but carries it around to remind himself of the "good old times." I bet it was Lady M. who forced him into quitting!~
@154  = ~He-he. At least her problem is partially curable. I would not be able to look a single inch shorter than I already am!~
@155  = ~That is sad.~
@156  = ~Careful, do not wake up Boo!~
@157  = ~Sweet are the dreams of that man.~
@158  = ~Do not do it then. The less I deal with the Dark one, the better.~
@159  = ~Always you act like we all need your constant supervision, Jaheira. Might you lower your guard down for a time?~ [SIMEJH01]
@160  = ~The likes of me? How did I offend, you, druid?~
@161  = ~You are mistaken, Jaheira. Love is something I take and give with generosity. I did not ruin any man and I was not a traitor to any woman.~ [SIMEJH02]
@162  = ~You seem to consider men fragile and unable to care for themselves, Jaheira. I wonder why?~
@163  = ~Jaheira, I repeat again, the white moss from the tundra is the ingredient needed for this potion. You cannot hope to be successful without it.~ [SIMEJH03]
@164  = ~I walk the wild and I know my herbs. If it interests you I have gathered the moss myself in Icewind Dale and I know its uses very well.~
@165  = ~I see. I had better write it down then.~
@166  = ~Listen, Jaheira, I know that look. Stop nagging at me, just say you are jealous and be done with it.~
@167  = ~So deep, warm and tender that you have remembered them for what? Three days? Before starting to try to entice your former ward?~
@168  = ~(*laughs*) Oldest, yeah, that’s true. But friend?~
@169  = ~Eh, Sime. Lay off. Jaheira is a real friend and a loyal companion, I would not have her insulted.~
@170  = ~Jaheira, pay Sime no heed. She will never understand the true love, such as you and I share.~
@171  = ~Jaheira, I love Sime. If you are as loyal to me as you always claim to be, you shall accept this. Otherwise, the roads are free for all to use.~
@172  = ~(*sighs*)  I was rude, I am sorry.~
@173  = ~I see. Know <CHARNAME>, that I will not ask you for your love again. It looks that you find a good place for it. But hid my advice, tell her how I loved you.~
@174  = ~The foolish ones hold the sense of victory in more esteem than the tenderness of the first days together. When you would spend the last penny of your happiness with your sweetheart, on the night of my triumph, do not come to me! I will not know you. And how will I be able to help? I would not know how to heal the happiness.~
@175  = ~Jaheira, you do not have to... I was rude, I am sorry... I am afraid it is too late, <CHARNAME>. Her mind was set on leaving. I am sorry, I did not mean for you to loose your friend.~
@176  = ~Am I truly blessed? Edwin the Great threw a glance my way! My heart sings with joy.~ [SIMEED01]
@177  = ~Indeed, your attention puts a smile on my face. A very wide smile.~
@178  = ~Really? Who might you talking about? Forgive me my Lord, I am exceptionally stupid today.~
@179  = ~Done, I am sitting (*struggles with laughter*)~
@180  = ~You are too precious of an ornament, Edwin, for me to wear tonight. I shall refuse your... ahem... kind offer. Now if you would excuse me, I am retiring to my chambers. (*goes away laughing*)~ [SIMEED02]
@181  = ~Shave off your beard, wizard. Then I might consider kissing you. I emphasize: "might".~ [SIMEED03]
@182  = ~Imbalance? Have you been befriending druids perchance, Edwin?~
@183  = ~Oh, forgive me, Edwin. Indeed, you are the sort who listens to his own voice exclusively. Let me guess, you have come up with a concept of the world’s balance on your own.~
@184  = ~With yourself as a Supreme Ruler of the World?~
@185  = ~How about elvenkind?~
@186  = ~I can take many things from you for amusement’s sake, Edwin. But that’s it. I am sick of you.~ [SIMEED04]
@187  = ~(*yawns*)  Edwin, what is it?~ [SIMEED05]
@188  = ~No, I am not ready to apologize. And I would never be.~
@189  = ~This game grew boring. I do not like you Edwin. I think you are ridiculous. Now go away.~ [SIMEED06]
@190  = ~I found the joke quite to my satisfaction.~
@191  = ~My beloved Edwin! Here you come at last. I can barely control my burning passion, come, hold me close, my lover.~ [SIMEED07]
@192  = ~The sweet sound of your voice intensifies my desire. Make haste, my beloved!~
@193  = ~So that WAS a charm spell, you dirty egomaniac!~ [SIMEED08]
@194  = ~You bet I will! (* slaps him off his feet and after a short struggle bounds his hands behinds his back*) Now you cannot cast.~
@195  = ~Shut up! On your knees and repeat after me: " I shall leave Sime alone."~
@196  = ~Good. I will come and unbind you in the morning least you get into any mischief.~
@197  = ~Keldorn, old man, you are a pitiful sight. Why are you on the road instead of sitting by the fireplace and telling your kids stories of old?~ [SIMEKE01]
@198  = ~Your first duty is to your family, Keldorn. Nothing is worth taking a father from his children’s life and a husband from his wife’s thoughts.~
@199  = ~You sound convinced. But does not your heart tell you that you are wrong?~
@200  = ~As you wish.~
@201  = ~You want to find a word that rhymes with Maria? Truly, Sir Keldorn, that’s a question to ask a bard, not a ranger such as I.~ [SIMEKE02]
@202  = ~Why won’t you write her what you just told me and add that the only rhymes you can find to Maria is Keldorn?~
@203  = ~My pleasure, Sir Keldorn.~ [SIMEKE03]
@204  = ~Do you think, Cernd, that the beasts and birds and plants can dream?~
@205  = ~I believe they do.~
@206  = ~I like asking questions of those who are quiet. Their answers often both charm and puzzle me. So what do you think? And this time I will not take a question for an answer.~
@207  = ~Which beast was it?~
@208  = ~Do tell me!~
@209  = ~I will.~
@210  = ~Would you return to Tethyr one day?~
@211  = ~Druids must have great patience... You have been adventuring with us for quite some time now.~
@212  = ~Why? Why do you need to be among <CHARNAME>’s associates?~
@213  = ~You certainly have foresight, druid. But would not you rather watch after your own son, not a stranger with a dark heritage?~
@214  = ~It always amazes me how one of your calling can be so warm and so chilling at the same time.~
@215  = ~Believe it or not, I tried to become a bard in my youth.~ [SIMEHA01]
@216  = ~There is more to the bards’ art than the ability to dance and to sing. I  do no worse than any intelligent woman can. But I have no true gift.~
@217  = ~I am. I told you I tried. When I want something I do not attempt it half-heartedly. I was very young and I had just begun to understand what sort of business my father is in.  He could not shield me from the reality any longer and was even making plans to start my training.~
@218  = ~A single plan. But a lousy one. I run away, hoping to earn money by utilizing all those boring lute lessons I was taught as a child.~ [SIMEHA02]
@219  = ~* Laughs * There was none in the first place, Haer’Dalis. Looking back I think that I was received more warmly than I deserved. But it was a sorry existence. I never knew when next I would eat, but I could not return home.~
@220  = ~A man dragged me off the stage, put me on his saddle and did not stop riding until we were far away. I thought him a bandit, kidnapping me to get back at my father.~
@221  = ~No. He was a ranger. He taught me everything I know of life and of love.~
@222  = ~I must have bored you to death with my story. You keep staring at me and you do not speak. I give you my word, I will not start a "History of Sime’s Life" next time.~ [SIMEHA03]
@223  = ~(*smiles*) But you are faery’s child yourself, you should not be so astounded by elven beauty.~
@224  = ~Well said, Haer’Dalis.~
@225  = ~That is very impressive! I have never seen anyone juggle with burning torches before. But be careful, Haer’Dalis, you will burn your fingers.~ [SIMEHA04]
@226  = ~I shall remind you of those words next time I am healing your body from the burns of a fireball, Haer’Dalis.~ [SIMEHA05]
@227  = ~I will, of course.~
@228  = ~It’s only me, Haer’Dalis, do not be startled. You were deep in your thoughts, I am sorry for bothering you.~ [SIMEHA06]
@229  = ~They say: think of a demon and it will come to your summons.~
@230  = ~I am who I am...~
@231  = ~If you wish, Haer’Dalis.~
@232  = ~Bravo, Haer’Dalis. You almost made me believe that you are a whore.~ [SIMEHA07]
@233  = ~The night grows long. Will you cheer me with a song, good bard?~ [SIMEHA08]
@234  = ~A pretty song. But I was thinking of a different sort.~
@235  = ~Not tonight nor any other.~
@236  = ~Yes, Haer’Dalis, you have treated me to a marvelous performance. The song was sweet and your voice even sweeter.~ [SIMEHA09]
@237  = ~I might have. I heard myself singing that’s for sure. But my voice lacks the typical chiming silver bell tone.~
@238  = ~I am all ears.~
@239  = ~Oh, not in my opinion. I find that elves sound harsher under the aforementioned circumstances.~ [SIMEHA10]
@240  = ~I did not mean to offend you Haer’Dalis. But I prefer to be direct in the matters of heart.~ [SIMEHA11]
@241  = ~But I am not playing games, Haer’Dalis. I do not fancy you.~
@242  = ~You can breathe, Haer’Dalis, but you should not hope. At the first moment I meet a man I decide if he is to be my lover or not. I do not change my mind.~
@243  = ~Not really.~
@244  = ~Rest assured, your baby-blue hair has nothing to do with my decision. It is about me, not about you, Haer’Dalis.~
@245  = ~I admire your choice of a familiar, Minsc. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a ranger to travel with a dire wolf or with a graceful panther. Yet you choose to give your friendship to a small and pitiful animal. That shows a richness of heart.~ [SIMEMI01]
@246  = ~I did, Minsc. He is very... fierce.~
@247  = ~(*pales*) I saw that. I am guessing it is an acquired taste.~
@248  = ~Well, I am glad we had this little chat, Minsc.~
@249  = ~Yes, Minsc, Boo is very fluffy. Exceptionally so. He is groomed to perfection.~ [SIMEMI02]
@250  = ~Boo says that?~
@251  = ~Yes, Minsc it was very nice. Boo’s, however, was a very non-traditional compliment, fresh and with zest. It would make me wonder about the secret meaning behind it.~
@252  = ~I loved what both of you said. You are both incredibly sweet.~
@253  = ~Oh, Minsc, I do not know if that’s a good idea. It looks like Boo does not want to leave your shoulder.~ [SIMEMI03]
@254  = ~Here we go. Good hamst... Ouch! It bit me! Where are you going, silly rat? Please, everyone, help me catch it! Minsc! Oh, MY DEAR MIELIKKI! <CHARNAME>! Come here! I do not understand... It was Minsc just a moment ago! Now it is some woman! She is unconscious, but she is alive. I do not understand...~ [SIMEMI04]
@255  = ~Who is this black woman? What is going on here?~
@256  = ~Dynaheir? DYNAHEIR! Please, wake up!~
@257  = ~It is Dynaheir, a witch Minsc was guarding before she was killed. This seems to be some sort of vile joke from Jon Irenicus’ depraved mind. It appears that Boo is now an enchanted animal that keeps Minsc in his true form. Here, I got Boo, please put him on her, we shall see if she turns back into Minsc.~
@258  = ~I have no idea who this woman is. Let’s wait until she wakes up.~
@259  = ~She is waking up. May be she can tell her story.~
@260  = ~You are right! He is Minsc again.~
@261  = ~Minsc, I warn you; ask anything of me, except that I hold Boo. You have my ear now.~ [SIMEMI05]
@262  = ~Yes, I suppose we can talk about Boo. After all, we will end up speaking of Boo anyway, no matter what subject we start with.~
@263  = ~He was very upset and you fainted.~
@264  = ~Yes. There is a tender connection between you and your furry friend. Cherish it, Minsc. Do not let Boo ever leave your side!~
@265  = ~Good, otherwise we are all in for a surprise. Your fainting spell I mean.~
@266  = ~Minsc, thank you so much for putting my mace in a safe and secret place. Now if you would tell me where this place is...~ [SIMEMI06]
@267  = ~Yes, but I need my mace. And when I am fighting nobody will take the mace from me, except if I were to be killed.~
@268  = ~If you do not want me dead, please, give me my mace.~
@269  = ~What if some enemy were to trick the honorable Minsc and attack from the back? Then poor Sime would not be able to defend herself without her mace.~
@270  = ~Your backpack is a very safe place indeed. Thank you, my dear Minsc, but in the future, please ask me before trying to help me out.~
@271  = ~I have always wondered about Dynaheir, Minsc. Did you say you went on dajemma to accompany her?~ [SIMEMI07]
@272  = ~Irenicus was far above your capabilities if he captured your former group. I have heard it was a formidable force.~
@273  = ~I am not a witch, no.~
@274  = ~It is always good when someone watches your back. Thank you for your generous offer Minsc. You will always have my most sincere friendship.~ [SIMEMI08]
@275  = ~Hey, Minsc. What are you giving me?~ [SIMEMI09]
@276  = ~It is a beautiful carrot. Thank you, Boo. Thank you, Minsc.~
@277  = ~That depends on the lady. Some like things that are just awful. I have seen ladies dressed like scarecrows. Simply ridiculous!~
@278  = ~No, I guess I am an ordinary lady, who likes pretty and sweet things.~ [SIMEMI10]
@279  = ~Thank you, Minsc. I will add it to my necklace once we are in town. You are very generous.~
@280  = ~Minsc, I want to speak to Boo for a second, can I?~ [SIMEBO01]
@281  = ~Sure, Minsc. (*whispers*) Dynaheir, can you hear me?~
@282  = ~Oh, Dynaheir! We all were hiding our chuckles when Minsc was talking to Boo! Yet Boo is the smartest among us! Minsc is wise to listen to you.~
@283  = ~It is very generous of you to share your wisdom with Minsc.~
@284  = ~I will admire you even more if you can achieve that, Dynaheir.~
@285  = ~I shall leave you to your efforts then.~
@286  = ~Pssst, Dynaheir! Dynaheir!~ [SIMEBO02]
@287  = ~Very smart. But I sense that Boo is indisposed to talk right now.~
@288  = ~It is fine, Minsc. She... He is just tired. The last battle was very taxing.~
@289  = ~I do not doubt.~
@290  = ~Will he ever understand that you are Dynaheir?~ [SIMEBO03]
@291  = ~Why?~
@292  = ~<CHARNAME> knows. I know. Some of our companions saw you too...~
@293  = ~Does he ever consider that you are a female? He keeps calling you "he".~
@294  = ~You sound protective of Minsc, Dynaheir.~
@295  = ~Might you love him?~
@296  = ~(*smiles*) Yes.~
@297  = ~I am sorry if I offended you last time, Dynaheir.~ [SIMEBO04]
@298  = ~Hmm?~
@299  = ~Mage?~
@300  = ~Your tale, it is too...~
@301  = ~ I can never understand when you talk seriously and when you are not. But it is an odd joke nonetheless.~
@302  = ~I wonder how did you come up with the name for your hamster, Minsc.~ [SIMEBO05]
@303  = ~In Rasheman?~
@304  = ~An amazing story. But Why Boo?~
@305  = ~Oh, I see.~
@306  = ~To Dorian, the man whose smile made my heart race! I shall never forget you!~
@307  = ~Shut up you crows! Let the dead be!~
@308  = ~I shall join in. To Dynaheir! None could summon a fireball with such a grace! To Khalid, the man who won each battle with due humility!~
@309  = ~Your conversation is making me sad. For I have a list of friends lost as well. Would you not drink quietly?~
@310  = ~Do not let your sorrow cloud your hearts, friends. We will all die eventually. I say let it be on the battlefield!~
@311  = ~Shut up yourself. I am drunk now and I wish to drink to my friends. Each of them was worth ten of your kind!~ [SIMEMA03]
@312  = ~To Khalid and Dynaheir!~
@313  = ~Why would you not join us instead? Mayhap you would feel better if you tell us of your brave friends who will not join us again.~
@314  = ~Let it be. But I cannot chase the sorrow away tonight. I shall be drunk.~
@315  = ~I know who you are, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>. Or rather what you are. If that was a secret, then it was not guarded carefully. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, was it your intention to let the world know that you are Bhaal’s child or it was a mishap?~ [SIME1_1]
@316  = ~I do not know, Sime. After I defeated Sarevok, my heritage became common knowledge. The rumours in this land spread faster than wildfire. I wonder sometimes what do they pay messengers for?~
@317  = ~Bad mishap, Sime. I wish I could keep my Gorion’s ward mantle for longer, but it was stripped away from me. By the way, Sime, if you’d stop calling me "m’<PRO_LADYLORD>" that might greatly improve the intimacy of our friendship.~
@318  = ~Of course that was my intention! Would you be a demigod, would you hide it?~
@319  = ~(*Laughs*) For staying in the inns and getting drunk, while the good folk do their jobs, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>. Indeed, the gossip travels faster than a bird flies and I fail to understand how. May be it is magic?~
@320  = ~Scrying devices you mean? I am afraid that even as we speak some wizened man has nothing better to do than to pry on me.~
@321  = ~Magic or not it is annoying as Nine Hells!~
@322  = ~Sime, I do not mean to be disrespectful, but this talk and your attitude upset me.~
@323  = ~You think so? (*laughs*) Then let’s give them something to look at my <PRO_LADYLORD>!

(*Before you can answer, Sime gives you a deep, long kiss*).~ [SIME1_2]
@324  = ~There could be more than one wizard watching, caring soul. Care to repeat the performance to keep them all interested? By the way, Sime, do stop calling me "m’<PRO_LADYLORD>" already! <CHARNAME> will do.~
@325  = ~Awww... Good, but not enough. We shall give it another try one day. That’s if you would drop that "m’<PRO_LADYLORD>" when talking to me. <CHARNAME> will do.~
@326  = ~<CHARNAME>, just <CHARNAME>. But for the gods sake, woman, control yourself!~
@327  = ~Sime, I assume that was a joke. But I will not let you off so easily next time. One more escapade like that - and you are out of this group!~
@328  = ~<CHARNAME>? I think I rather like your name. Try it again? Why not? You are a good kisser, even when caught unaware.~
@329  = ~Fear not, <CHARNAME>, I am in full control of what I am doing.~
@330  = ~My <PRO_LADYLORD>, I was only wishing to cheer you. If you prefer to revel in your grim thoughts, suit yourself.~
@331  = ~Then I shall call you by your name. <CHARNAME>... I like the sound of it. So, <CHARNAME> you would prefer to be incognito?~
@332  = ~Yes, Sime. Way too often people expect a heroic feat or a mad <PRO_MANWOMAN>man’s act or who knows what else of me, just because I am a Bhaalspawn.~
@333  = ~I guess. But really, it is none of your business.~
@334  = ~It is not that bad actually. Half of the people run away from me, another half want me to do something, and all that based on the same fact: "because you are a Bhaalspawn". I guess it is funny in a way.~
@335  = ~I understand. Or at least I can see why you are aggravated. I cannot stop the fools from gaping at you, but I can promise that I shall think of you as a person, not as something menacing and unusual.~
@336  = ~(*Shrugs*) If you say so.~
@337  = ~Funny? You are gifted with a happy character if you find it funny. I cannot stop the fools from gaping at you, but I can promise that I shall think of you as a person, not as something menacing and unusual.~
@338  = ~I do not know. I am a half-elf, half-human and I’ve never hid any part of my heritage, like some half-bloods do. May be if I was a demigod, I would not keep it a secret either.~
@339  = ~My point exactly. I cannot change who I am and I am not ashamed of my heritage. After all it was my mother, who had peculiar taste in men, not I. And Sime, do call me <CHARNAME>. "My <PRO_LADYLORD>" unnerves me.~
@340  = ~Sime, let’s not make a big deal out of it.~
@341  = ~I would not wish anyone to face the choices I face. I cope, Sime, but it is not easy to carry the burden of my accursed heritage. The crowd’s fascination does not help things. Half of the people run away from me, another half want me to do something, and all that based on the same fact: "because you are a Bhaalspawn". Pray Sime, pray hard every night NOT to wake up next morn a demigod and a famous persona in the Realms as it happened to me.~
@342  = ~Then I shall call you by your name. <CHARNAME>... I like the sound of it. I think we have something in common: my mother had very unusual tastes where men were concerned it seems. But at least she picked a local murderer and a thief, not the Lord of Murder.~
@343  = ~We shall not then.~
@344  = ~(*Laughs*) Your warning is belated, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>. I am now Sime Linvail, the one who travels in the company of Bhaalspawn! ~
@345  = ~Sime, I really do not have time for a small talk.~
@346  = ~But I warned you! And Sime, do call me <CHARNAME>. "My <PRO_LADYLORD>" unnerves me.~
@347  = ~What have I done! I doomed you! And since we have such an intimate connection as a common curse, would you consider calling me <CHARNAME>?~
@348  = ~Thank you for the warning, <CHARNAME>. I think I rather like your name.~
@349  = ~<CHARNAME>? I think I rather like your name. I shall use it often.~
@350  = ~I know who you are, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>. Or rather what you are. If that was a secret, then it was not guarded carefully. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, was it your intention to let the world know that you are Bhaal’s child or it was a mishap?~
@351  = ~Bad mishap, Sime. I wish I could keep my Gorion’s ward mantle for longer, but it was stripped away from me. By the way, Sime, if you’d stop calling me "milord" that might greatly improve the intimacy of our friendship.~
@352  = ~You think so? (*laughs*) Then let’s give them something to look at my <PRO_LADYLORD>!

(*Before you can answer, Sime gives you a deep, long kiss*).~
@353  = ~I heard you moaning in your sleep another night. It might be that I am intruding, <CHARNAME>, but do you have nightmares?~ [SIME2_1]
@354  = ~You are impossible Sime. What I dream of should not concern you.~
@355  = ~Yes, Sime. Ever since Gorion died and I was forced to fight for my dear life. I am used to nightmares, Sime, do not worry.~
@356  = ~I do not have any bloody nightmares. I was not moaning. It must have been wind or a lovesick cat you have heard.~
@357  = ~If you do not mind, I would rather not to discuss it further. Sime, I took you along to fight my battles and I am not interested in discussing my private life with you.~
@358  = ~I am a healer, remember? I might be able to help you. You look troubled and you have ill dreams. Even now I can see pain in your eyes. May be a sleeping draught...~
@359  = ~No, Sime, no sleeping draught will get rid of my dreams. Ever since Gorion died and I was forced to fight for my dear life I have had those visions. I am used to nightmares by now, do not worry.~
@360  = ~Thank you for the thought, but no, I do not need a potion. I will cope.~
@361  = ~I know you mean well, but I do not require any help. The nightmares are painful, but they bring me power once in a while.~
@362  = ~Sleeping draught? How about a taste of sweet maiden’s lips for a potion?~
@363  = ~You sound so sure,<CHARNAME>. So be it. But you need only ask for my help, should you change your mind.~
@364  = ~Oh, you are one of those who would go through the worst torture to gain even the smallest grain of knowledge or power? Suit yourself then. But you need only ask for my help, should you change your mind.~
@365  = ~My kisses are known to wake a <PRO_MANWOMAN> up, not to put <PRO_HIMHER> to sleep. ~
@366  = ~It is awful. I can see that the nightmares wear you down and there is pain in your eyes. May be a sleeping draught...~ [SIME2_3]
@367  = ~No, Sime, a sleeping draught will not save me from my dreams.~
@368  = ~(*Smiles*) Of course. A lovesick cat it was. Should you meet that poor animal, do let me know. I might have a potion or two to help the unfortunate beast to sleep better.~ [SIME2_4]
@369  = ~And that is precisely what I am doing: fighting your battles. Fear cuts deeper than swords, they say. Even now I can see pain in your eyes caused by the ill dreams. I am a healer and a good healer mends souls as often as mending bodies. I can give you a sleeping draught or I can talk to you.  Whichever will bring you peace of mind.~
@370  = ~I said: I do not want to discuss my private life with you.~
@371  = ~Have it your own way then, you stubborn lout. You will not hear another word from me, but a battle cry.~
@372  = ~Do not call me a wise owl, <CHARNAME>. I have had my share of mistakes and silly escapades. Sometimes I think that I am alive only by the will of the gods who guard all fools.~ [SIME3_1]
@373  = ~You have done something stupid? I am sorry, Sime, but I will need proof to believe you. Come tell me about at least one thing you have done wrong.~
@374  = ~Sure. We all did. But you appear to be a very rational person at present. Care to trade a tale of your apparently crazy youth?~
@375  = ~Whatever you say. Sime, we do not have time for arguments. Be a good girl, stop hanging at my every word and turning everything into a discussion!~
@376  = ~I will oblige your curiosity. I ran away from the safe home where Aran placed me to when I was young. I wanted no less than to become a famous bard. The grand plan was to collect the folk songs of the Barbarians of the Icewind Dale. I reasoned that I could sustain myself by singing and dancing as I will be making my way up North.~
@377  = ~Sounds like a daring enterprise. And I agree, an unwise one. Was your expedition somehow related to Aran?~
@378  = ~But that’s a brilliant idea! I have never heard Barbarian sagas in the South. Why did not you go through with your plan?~
@379  = ~I am convinced, Sime. That was a rather silly escapade.~
@380  = ~Of course it was related to Aran. In those days everything I did was in some way connected to my father. I ran away after I finally understood who my father is.~
@381  = ~Did he find you then?~
@382  = ~What happened next, Sime?~
@383  = ~(*Yawn*) Yes, sure thing.~
@384  = ~I learned later that my father sent in secret a couple of thugs to watch over me and to give me a coin or two if the things became too rough. Aran knew that interfering directly or arguing with me was useless. He hoped, that I would return back of my own volition and that may be life on the streets would make me less judgmental. He did not foresee that Darriel would walk into a tavern where I was trying to sing for a meal...~
@385  = ~Darriel of Tangelwood, the mentor you have mentioned?~
@386  = ~Your father has no divination talent then?~
@387  = ~Yes, him. Darriel is not among the living any more, <CHARNAME>... I would rather not continue the story now. A sad storyteller would not lift your spirit, and I wish to see you smiling.~
@388  = ~Do not you try to be smart with me! You know well enough that my father’s talents are of different sort than needed for the Arcane Arts devotee. You need not remind me of his true calling.~
@389  = ~I did not mean to bore you to tears, <CHARNAME>. I shall be quiet from now on.~
@390  = ~Brilliant? <CHARNAME>, you either have a dark sense of humour or you have heard nothing at all about the barbarians of Icewind Dale! I prefer to think the latter. Know that what waited for me, then a young girl incapable to defend herself, were slavery, torture, rape and in best case quick death.~
@391  = ~It was a stupid joke, Sime, I am sorry.~
@392  = ~Oh, I did not know that. Indeed it is for the best that you did not go. But what happened instead?~
@393  = ~(*Shrug*) Whatever...~
@394  = ~It was. But all is well that ends well.~
@395  = ~I think that talking to a wooden statue is a better than talking to you! At least it is silent. You ARE Bhaal’s blood, cold and unfeeling, I know now.~
@396  = ~Since we talked last time, I started thinking of Darriel often. You even remind me of him. May be not in looks but in the way you’re talking so surely, fight with such valour and you both know mercy and have talent to understand others.~ [SIME4_1]
@397  = ~Your words are pleasant enough, Sime, but I feel ill at ease when you compare me to your dead lover.~
@398  = ~I gather that Darriel commanded your respect and admiration. (*aside*) Makes me wonder what else he won.~
@399  = ~Woman quit your whining. I am not your Darriel reborn from the dead.~
@400  = ~There is none like me, Sime. I am Bhaal’s heir and you ought to sense my greatness far surpassing anything a mere mortal can master. Do not dare to compare me with some snooty Elf, wench!~
@401  = ~Strange, I am almost sure that I can hear jealousy in your voice. Everything Darriel was to me. He was a biter foe when he carried me away and I thought he was my father’s hireling. He was a chance comrade and an imprisoned, when I wanted nothing but to escape. He became a friend and a mentor when I discovered the true calling of my heart. But he was never my lover.~ [SIME4_2]
@402  = ~Do not reply if you do not want to, but I cannot help but ask why? Another woman? Too much ranging to do, no time for gentle talk? His romantic interests lay elsewhere?~
@403  = ~Oh.~
@404  = ~I am sorry if I have unintentionally stirred painful memories.~
@405  = ~And now he is dead. How tragic. If you do not mind, Sime I have better things to do than talking to you about some rotting corpse.~
@406  = ~I think that such curiosity befits a cat or a bored woman, rather than a <PRO_MANWOMAN> grown. But to answer your question, I guess I am a coward of a sort and I was scared of the love and trust I had in him, so I pushed him away. However, was not it for the best? I miss my friend badly, how much worse would it hurt was he my lover?~
@407  = ~No worse I think. You will call to your lost friends in your dreams, and you will be tricked for a moment and extend your hands and wake up only to the empty room, the locked doors and the bitter taste of loss.~
@408  = ~I did not think that you were one to be afraid to love. Even if it hurts sometimes.~
@409  = ~I grow bored, Sime. Let’s get going.~
@410  = ~Of course, you are right. But no man have I loved like I loved my father, and I was so bitterly disappointed. Since then I have a trapped door on the bottom of my heart and I will not allow any man to enter it. That’s why not Darriel.~
@411  = ~I am not afraid to fall in love <CHARNAME> and I loved many. But no man have I loved like I loved my father, and I was so bitterly disappointed. Since then I have a trapped door on the bottom of my heart and I will not allow any man to enter it. That’s why not Darriel.~
@412  = ~As you wish. I can see that you have little interest in me, so I’ll spare you from now on.~
@413  = ~I guess I am a coward of a sort and I was scared have the love and trust I had in him, so I pushed him away. However was not it for the best? I miss my friend badly, how much worse would it hurt was he my lover?~
@414  = ~No, I am actually grateful to you. It feels easier somehow after I said it. No man have I loved like I loved my father, and I was so bitterly disappointed. Since then I have a trapped door on the bottom of my heart and I will not allow any man to enter it. That’s why not Darriel.~
@415  = ~No, you are not. Strange, I am almost sure that I can hear jealousy in your voice. Everything Darriel was to me. He was a biter foe when he carried me away and I thought he was my father’s hireling. He was a chance comrade and an imprisoned, when I wanted nothing but to escape. He became a friend and mentor while I discovered the true calling of my heart. But he was never my lover.~
@416  = ~And now he is dead. How tragic! If you do not mind, Sime, I have better things to do than talking to you about some rotting corpse.~
@417  = ~May be the god’s part of your soul is well fitting what Bhaal had hoped for, but I find that the mortal part of your soul is wanting.~
@418  = ~I am troubled by one thought lately, <CHARNAME>. My father, he allowed me to follow you without a protest. I was almost certain that he was actually glad, when I took my leave. Why?~
@419  = ~Sime, I met your father once, I cannot judge his actions. But why should he protest? Do I strike you as a man whom you cannot trust to travel in a company of maidens?~
@420  = ~Sime, there is a guild war out there, remember? May be he thinks you are safer by my side?~
@421  = ~He did not protest your earlier departures, did he?~
@422  = ~You think it is a part of some sinister plan of his? May be I should have accepted Bodhi’s offer.~
@423  = ~I have a great solution to the problem: you go back to your father and we all will have fewer things to worry about.~
@424  = ~No, <CHARNAME>, you are a decent sort and no maiden would feel endangered in your company. You are even pleasant to look upon and sound like a reasonable man. Still, my father always argued against my ranging.~
@425  = ~You think that I am a good-looking fellow, flatterer? I am not sure, but I think I might guess his reason. There is a guild war out there, remember? May be he thinks you are safer by my side?~
@426  = ~My chivalrous warrior, bold and pure, I am sure that he took it into account. Nowhere I am safer than with you and your valorous friends. Still, my father always argued against my ranging.~
@427  = ~You worry yourself needlessly, my Lady. Now, let’s continue on.~
@428  = ~Even if there is some dark design behind Aran’s actions, calm yourself. We shall avoid any trap he might be setting.~
@429  = ~You are a member of my brave party, Sime, and in my heart I place you among my most cherished friends.  Together we shall strike for righteousness! Stay close to me and worry not about Aran’s plots.~
@430  = ~I guess, you are right. I must be thinking too suspiciously of my father. After all, Aran has never tried to use me in his designs before. Why should he now? I am sorry for wasting your time with my doubts. It is just I would not want to hurt you in any way. The one who is warned is safe, they say.~
@431  = ~Your words have cheered me up. I must be thinking too low of my father. After all, Aran has never tried to use me in his designs before. Why should he now? I am sorry for wasting your time with my doubts. It is just I would not want to hurt you in any way. The one who is warned is safe, they say.~
@432  = ~You are very kind. It is just I would not want to hurt you in any way. The one who is warned is safe, they say. And you know what, <CHARNAME>? I would gladly stay very near you.~
@433  = ~No, you should not have. My father is a dark man, but he has a code of honour of a sort and he is a living being. The rival guild mistress has neither of those qualities. Aran might have some sort of hidden design or he may not. But she is your enemy for sure, an enemy to anybody of flesh and blood. She is hatred incarnate. Fear her, <CHARNAME>.~
@434  = ~Speaking of Bodhi. Here is a reason for you. There is a guild war out there, remember? May be Aran thinks that you are safer by my side?~
@435  = ~My noble <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, I am sure that he took it into account. I am among valiant friends when I travel with you. Still, my father always argued against my ranging.~
@436  = ~You worry yourself needlessly, Sime. Now, let’s continue on.~
@437  = ~Even if there is some dark design behind Aran’s actions, calm yourself. We shall avoid any trap he might be setting. Besides, I do not think Aran will use his own daughter as a tool in his games.~
@438  = ~Sime, whatever it is, you and I will be able to deal with it in time. I trust you and I know you to be my kindred spirit and a valorous warrior. May be Aran had finally seen that you can take care of yourself and others and that’s why he did not argue? Stay close to me, my friend and worry not about Aran’s plots.~
@439  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sure that he took it into account. I am among valiant friends when I travel with you. Still, my father always argued against my ranging.~
@440  = ~You are one of my friends, Sime. I know you for a valorous warrior. May be Aran had finally seen that you can take care of yourself and others and that’s why he did not argue? In any case, stay close to me, Sime, and worry not about Aran’s plots.~
@441  = ~If you think that it is a solution, then so be it.~
@442  = ~Yes, my father always argued against my ranging.~
@443  = ~I am not sure, but I think I might guess his reason. There is a guild war out there, remember? May be he thinks you are safer by my side? ~
@444  = ~I am not sure, but I think I might guess his reason. There is a guild war out there, remember? May be he thinks you are safer by my side?~
@445  = ~(*Sime stands still for a moment, facing the wind, her locks flying wild around her face. Then she smiles and turns to you.*)

Do you like my new hairdo? I have the best hairdresser in the world.~ [SIME6_1]
@446  = ~Sime, all I see is you, facing gusts of wind. Not that you do not look pretty, with your hair flying, but what sort of hairdo is that?~
@447  = ~Wind will be your hairdresser then?~
@448  = ~Ah? What?~
@449  = ~Why do I get a disturbing feeling that the next thing you will ask me will be if you look fat in your armor?~
@450  = ~Northern wind hairdo - the style I prefer to any else.~
@451  = ~I like your style, Sime. I always wanted to meet a woman who looks lovely without an effort.~
@452  = ~Now if you would only cut your hair, make some of those little curls whatever they call them, and put some make up on, then I’d say you improved your appearance. Letting the wind to make a mess of your hair will not do anything for your looks.~
@453  = ~I think you have just presented me with a challenge. I should take some time and help you to brush up you skills in gallant talk.~
@454  = ~You have my permission to tutor me in gallant matters, Madam.~
@455  = ~Sime, I am eloquent enough with ladies who are of interest to me. You are not one of them. Sorry, but at some point I had to be plain, since you do not understand more subtle hints.~
@456  = ~That will be not needed, Sime.~
@457  = ~I see it as a challenge. I am going to prove you that I have fine knowledge of the science of tender passion and its linguistic applications.~
@458  = ~I will take this task very close to my heart, <CHARNAME>.~
@459  = ~Honesty is one of your finest qualities, <CHARNAME>. Do not worry, I will leave you alone.~
@460  = ~Oh, I see. I think, I get the hint.~
@461  = ~I will be waiting for a demonstration... impatiently.~
@462  = ~I am afraid we have different idea on beauty.~
@463  = ~I will not, do not worry.~
@464  = ~(*Laughs*) I noticed that you were watching me and I fished for a compliment from you, silly.~
@465  = ~Oh, a compliment? The Lady’s desire will be granted then. I like your style, Sime. I always wanted to meet a woman who looks lovely without an effort.~
@466  = ~Sorry, Sime the rough lips of this warrior are unaccustomed to saying gallant nonsense. ~
@467  = ~It is a pleasing thing to get some rest at last. The day was long and the battles were many, but it is done, the fire is warm, and no danger is near. Come, sit by me and I shall sooth your hurts and heal your wounds.~
@468  = ~I feel quite well, Sime. The day’s work is done, but did not we decide to exercise in courtly speech? Shall I start my lesson now?~
@469  = ~My wounds are all healed, Sime... do you know what I appreciate about a fire the most... It is the way it softens features and makes our hearts gentler. About our lesson in gallant talk my Lady - is there a better time for it?~
@470  = ~Sime, all I need is a good night’s sleep. Just leave me where I am.~
@471  = ~There will never be better time. So lead the way, <CHARNAME>.~
@472  = ~To prove to my Lady that I am skilled in gentle matters I shall sing a song of love and let’s see if the Lady can continue. Will you play this little game with me, Sime?~
@473  = ~On the second thought it is too taxing. I mean to talk and whatever. Can I just kiss you and buy you a dozen of crimson rodelias if we happen to pass by a flower shop?~
@474  = ~On the second thought it is too taxing. I mean to talk and whatever. Can I just kiss your hand and buy you a dozen of crimson rodelias if we happen to pass by a flower shop?~
@475  = ~I am an old soldier and I rarely speak the words of love, but I shall sing a song about it and let’s see if you can continue. Will you play this little game with me, Sime?~
@476  = ~Rest then, <CHARNAME>. And do not overexert yourself by looking for flowers.~
@477  = ~I was starting to wonder when I would hear at last anything more gentle than a battle song from you, <CHARNAME>. You seem to avoid what feeds so many others of your calling. I like the game, <CHARNAME>, it will lighten our hearts and will ease our minds.~
@478  = ~The fountains mingle with the river
And the rivers with the ocean, 
The winds of heaven mix for ever
With a sweet emotion...          ~
@479  = ~Ahem... Love, love me do,
You know I love you...~
@480  = ~I love a maiden young as spring,
Her eyes bloom as flowers green
Her hair sways as golden wheat
Her lips are rubies sweet as sin.~
@481  = ~Nothing in the world is single,
All things by a law divine
In one another’s being mingle-
Why not I with thine?

What a lovely song. What will you try next?~
@482  = ~I love a maiden young as spring
Her eyes bloom as flowers green
Her hair sways as golden wheat
Her lips are rubies sweet as sin.~
@483  = ~Nothing. I think I am too tired to continue the game.~
@484  = ~I’ll always be true,
So please, love me do!

What a lovely song. What will you try next?~
@485  = ~I do not know this song, <CHARNAME>. But I would like to hear the rest of it.~
@486  = ~Of course you do not know it! I tricked you, I wrote it myself today. Here is the rest:
                                 
To you alone I shall tell
That Lady wears silver bell,
You won’t see it when she passes 
But you will hear when she laughs.~
@487  = ~I guess you lost then, Sime. Do I get a prize?~
@488  = ~Never mind, I think I am too tired to continue the game.~
@489  = ~Oh, but it is wonderful. Makes me wonder though who the Lady in question might be.~
@490  = ~I think I shall kiss you as a reward. For

...the sunlight clasps the earth,
And the moonbeams kiss the sea-
What are all these kissings worth,
If thou kiss not me?~
@491  = ~Already? I thought we just started. Well, it was amusing and I must admit that you sounded very sweet. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@492  = ~Sleep tight then.~
@493  = ~At least you are honest.~
@494  = ~You are my soul mate then? But sometimes loneliness of the woods is too much for a person to bare. Trust me, I know. One needs friends even if he chooses solitude.~
@495  = ~I know, Sime. I am glad to have trusted companions with me. I would imagine some would come by to trade a tale or two into my humble abode far away.~
@496  = ~Solitude is fine with me, I never feel lonely. And I am so tired of you talking! ~
@497  = ~I know, that I would.~
@498  = ~I have no such place. I envy the feeling you have for Candlekeep. Do you think I might visit one day with you there?~
@499  = ~You would not like Candlekeep, Sime. It’s full of old scholars and the life centers around the library...~
@500  = ~Why not? But it is difficult to gain an entry. You have to pay 10,000 gold pieces or carry a book of particular value. It is really a strange rule, but it is effective in keeping almost everyone out and in expanding the library.~
@501  = ~I like libraries. I visited once an Edificant library with Darriel and another time we went through Silverymoon. I love the feeling of ages and peoples of old watching you from the shelves. I think I rather fancy the idea to visit Candlekeep.~
@502  = ~If you’d live there maybe you can help me to get over the city wall or something. I do not own much.~
@503  = ~I am not sure. I avoid interfering with the business of gods, yet I would not like the taint to change you into a merciless killing machine. I’ve become a ranger against my father’s will. It must be a much harder battle for you.~
@504  = ~I fear it myself Sime and I watch my heart carefully. I will not let Bhaal take over. ~
@505  = ~What’s your problem, ranger? I am Bhaal’s spawn and I am not as shy of the callings of my blood.~
@506  = ~You are being too grim. I do not notice any evil influences in me. Surely men point their fingers and call me names, and maniacs like Irenicus hunt me, and I have nightmares sometimes... Oops, I guess there is something evil around me, but I shall be all right.~
@507  = ~I am surely glad to hear that.~
@508  = ~Indeed, my advice was useless then.~
@509  = ~I think I worried needlessly. You are far too cheerful to be overtaken by the God of Murder.~
@510  = ~(*You hear her quiet voice, and suddenly you listen more carefully and you can distinguish her words.*).

Forest Maiden, tonight a thousand of young acolytes will ask for you to cast your glance their way, a hundred of priests dressed in ritual robes will pray to you, a dozen of sturdy rangers will whisper your name among their many toils in hope for your blessing. And among many words that reach your ears tonight, I, Sime Linvail ask you to listen to my plea. Forest Maiden, my prayer is not for me, but for a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of valor, a <PRO_MANWOMAN> tormented. <PRO_HESHE> is cursed often for no other fault than <PRO_HISHER> blood, <PRO_HESHE> has endured many trials, and I fear will face many more before <PRO_HESHE> is through. Bless <PRO_HIMHER>, Mielikki and give <PRO_HIMHER> some hope.~
@511  = ~Sime? Were you prayers... for me?~
@512  = ~(*Stay silent*)~
@513  = ~Sime, what do you think you are doing?~
@514  = ~You are awake? (*Laughs*) A stupid question, really. Of course you are. I was praying for you. You... do not mind, do you?~
@515  = ~I do not, but it is not really necessary. My god watches over me, Sime.~
@516  = ~No, of course not. Thank you, Sime. I did not know you cared so much for me.~
@517  = ~Sime, do not you understand? I am not tormented, I am not cursed! I am who I am, a child of Bhaal, and I am ready to face my destiny. I do not need your prayers or your pity!~
@518  = ~My kind Lady. Thank you.~
@519  = ~I know that, <CHARNAME>. But I fear for you sometimes.~
@520  = ~Do you fear for me or do you fear of me?~
@521  = ~Do not fear for me, Sime. I am not tormented, I am not cursed! I am who I am, a child of Bhaal, and I am ready to face my destiny. I do not need your prayers or your pity!~
@522  = ~You know, that’s getting too weird. Let me say you a "good night" and let’s forget the whole thing.~
@523  = ~I never feared you.~
@524  = ~Some will say you should.~
@525  = ~I am glad to hear that, Sime. It is pleasant for a change. With all those rumors floating around Athkatla, I guess that I am mentioned more often in a curse than in a prayer.~
@526  = ~They can say all they want, those others. Sometimes I wish to cast a silence spell when I hear old crows trading dark stories about you. But I am no crow, I know you and I trust my heart. I am not afraid of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@527  = ~Good night then.~
@528  = ~You cannot forbid me to feel. I did not know that the fact that someone is concerned about your wellbeing would upset you so. But have it your own way.~
@529  = ~I do care for you, <CHARNAME>. And I fear for you sometimes.~
@530  = ~<CHARNAME>, do not thank me. I did nothing out of the ordinary. I am a priest and it is my duty to pray for those I care for and I fear for.~
@531  = ~(*Sime comes near you and brushes hair aside from your forehead gently*)~
@532  = ~(*Catch her hand and squeeze her fingers*) Sime? Were you prayers... for me?~
@533  = ~Sime, that’s enough! You are acting like a mother hen! I do not need your prayers or your pity!~
@534  = ~(*Sime walks away*) ~
@535  = ~It is strange how things that are so simple suddenly become more complex. When I was young, the Guild members were men visiting my father, often giving me a passing glance, sometimes joking with me.~ [SIME11_1]
@536  = ~Yet now I know that some of them are vicious assassins, others are petty thieves, and the rest are so wicked and lie so often that I do not have a clue how they acquire the coins filling their pockets. I happened to run across some of my father’s associates when ranging. It was not pleasant.~
@537  = ~And now you are travelling with one. That is what you are trying to say? You knew it when you joined in with me. What has changed?~
@538  = ~Oh, Sime, my poor noble-hearted Sime! I know how you feel. It is not easy to say sometimes, what is a good or is an evil thing to do.~
@539  = ~Sime, you do what you must do, no matter if it pleases you or not. You are a ranger, a keeper of law and order, and defender of the weak.~
@540  = ~Of course, of course. Simple things are complex, complex things are simple. Can we go now?~
@541  = ~What has changed? I have been thinking a lot about you lately. You are... you are different from greedy and merciless assassins, and you do not take the last possessions from the poor. You are furtive, cavalier yet cautious, and your avaricious personality determined your past. But somehow, you are yet unspoiled by the rogue’s ways.~
@542  = ~I am a rogue, Sime, and probably will always be a rogue.~
@543  = ~You are trying to... embellish me?~
@544  = ~May be I am a vagabond, but a charming one. You like me no matter what do not you?~
@545  = ~Enough of this rubbish, Sime. Let’s go.~
@546  = ~I know. If there is no hope for you to engage into a more honorable activity, promise me at least that you will not forsake this odd code of honor you now have.~
@547  = ~This world is not made for keeping promises, Sime. It changes at every turn of the hourglass. I’d rather not bind myself with empty words.~
@548  = ~I will not change, Sime. I promise. With all this talk about my colleagues, who are so prone to make things theirs... Tell me, Sime, did anyone attempt to steal your heart?~
@549  = ~You are right, words are empty. It is time for us to deal with something more material.~
@550  = ~Oh, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@551  = ~But do not look for the culprit among the members of the Guild. Look closer... (*Quietly*). You will find <PRO_HIMHER> in the looking glass.~
@552  = ~I do not. I know that there is no hope for you to engage into a more honorable activity. Promise me at least that you will not forsake this odd code of honor you now have.~
@553  = ~I will not change, Sime. I promise. With all this talk about my colleagues, who are so prone to make things theirs? Tell me, Sime, did anyone attempt to steal your heart?~
@554  = ~I like you the way you are now, yes. I know that there is no hope for you to engage into a more honorable activity. Promise me at least that you will not forsake this odd code of honor you now have.~
@555  = ~Oh, so my opinion is rubbish? How very sweet of you to let me know that. I will make sure that you are not bothered by it anymore.~
@556  = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>. I often do not know if coming to the Guild to see my father is good or bad for me. I think it is a good thing though. I love my father and love can never be a bad thing, can it?~
@557  = ~I am no expert on love. Do ask someone else, please. Actually, it will be nice if you direct all of your questions to someone else.~
@558  = ~Love can never be a bad thing, Sime. With all this talk about Shadow Thieves, who are so prone to make things theirs, I have meant to ask a question of you for some time... Is it just because of Aran that you visit the Guild? Or did some charming rogue steal your heart?~
@559  = ~If I were you, I would not come see Aran. But you are the only one who can decide something like that. With all this talk about Shadow Thieves, who are so prone to make things theirs, I have meant to ask question of you for some time... Is it just because of Aran that you visit the Guild? Or did some charming rogue steal your heart?~
@560  = ~I will in the future.~
@561  = ~It comforts me that you think so. As for your question, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@562  = ~I lack your straightforwardness, I am afraid. As for your question, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@563  = ~I am true to my vows to Mielikki. However, I would prefer that it not be my own father and his associates from whom I need to defend people.~
@564  = ~May be you should go away from Amn one day and leave the past behind? With some decent man may be? Or... forgive me if I am being too intrusive, but I wonder if it is just because of Aran that you visit the Guild? Or did some charming rogue steal your heart?~
@565  = ~Duty is sacred and vows cannot be broken. I am glad we talked about it. If you ever feel like you are about to falter, do seek me out, Sime. Or another loyal friend. But tell me, Sime, is your father your only connection to the Guild? Or did some charming rogue steal your heart and cause you all this pain? Because if one did, I am going to take his head off his shoulders.~
@566  = ~Aran is not the best father by far, but you could have gotten worse. Just think, as far as fathers are concerned, compared to me, you definitely lucked out.  Oh, you have finally smiled? With all this talk about Shadow Thieves, who are so prone to make things theirs, I have meant to ask a question of you for some time... Is it just because of Aran that you visit the Guild? Or did some charming rogue steal your heart?~
@567  = ~I tried so many times, <CHARNAME>. Did not I tell you of my travels? I am tired of running. As for your question, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@568  = ~I will be sure to seek you out, <CHARNAME>. As for your question, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@569  = ~If you can make a joke about your father, then indeed, I should probably learn from you and take it less seriously. After all, I am not my father. As for your question, an attempt was made recently, I think.~
@570  = ~Sure, let us go. I am ranting far too much.~
@571  = ~I cannot believe it! Come, <CHARNAME>, look at this! I have never seen it grow in these parts and never does it bloom at this time of the year. It is a small miracle, this flower.~ [SIME12_1]
@572  = ~Why, I think it is Suna’s Bloom. Is not it? I have not seen one before.~
@573  = ~Hmm, what do we have here? I believe that it’s commonly called "Suna’s Blessing" or Solanum Carolinense Eunwoe in Elvish. Dwarves call it a Lay Flower and Forest Gnomes in Tethyr know it under the name of Auglim Leaf. The Halfing name would be... would be...~
@574  = ~A nice enough purple flower it is, Sime. But a miracle?~
@575  = ~Ahem, what is all this noise about? A couple leaves and few purple buds on a stem? Women!~
@576  = ~Sime, has anyone told you before that you have an impossible voice? I, for my part, do not wish to hear it more often than absolutely necessary.~
@577  = ~It is a very rare plant. I am surprised you know of it. Do you know why it is called Suna’s Bloom?~
@578  = ~I have heard tales, Sime. Is it true that a freshly picked flower of Suna’s Bloom will make one more attractive to the opposite sex?~
@579  = ~So, why it is called Suna’s Bloom? Sounds rather intriguing.~
@580  = ~I have a feeling that you will tell me whether I want to know or not. Speak, Sime, I am all ears.~
@581  = ~I am not sure I want to know. Suna is not a deity I am prone to worship.~
@582  = ~So the scrolls say. We can see if it is true or not. Here, let me pick it and attach it to your cloak. Then I can tell you the effect.~
@583  = ~If it is as rare a flower as you say, it is better to leave it growing, Sime. I reckon I am attractive enough without it.~
@584  = ~Among our gloomy days full of spilt blood and endless battles, this flower reminds me of the lighter, gentler side of life. I will wear the Bloom, not to appear more attractive, but to honor Love.~
@585  = ~Let’s see if the scrolls lie.~
@586  = ~That sounds like an interesting idea. But the finder is the keeper. Sime shall wear the bloom and I shall see how much more attractive she can become.~
@587  = ~My Lady, among our gloomy days full of spilt blood and endless battles, this flower reminds me of the lighter, gentler side of life. And so do you, Sime Linvail. Please, humor me and wear the bloom.~
@588  = ~You are as wise as you are handsome, <CHARNAME>. Let the flower grow unharmed.~
@589  = ~Here, the flower is on your cloak. Now I shall announce my judgement.~
@590  = ~So what do you think, my gentle judge? ~
@591  = ~Sime, if the effect is too strong, I will take it off. Speak to me!~
@592  = ~Eh, how is it?~
@593  = ~You always appeared handsome in my eyes, but the scrolls do not lie, <CHARNAME>. You look incredible: there is a glow about your face and your orbs shine; the troubles are wiped from your forehead and even your voice sounds sweeter to me. I am certainly glad the enchantment does not last long.~
@594  = ~Why do not you want the enchantment to last, Sime?~
@595  = ~I think I will take the flower off then. I feel odd.~
@596  = ~I’ll let you guess that one on your own.~
@597  = ~It is too late. The spell is on you and it cannot be reversed. Do not worry, in few short hours you will be your old self again. And I promise to guard you against any unwanted attention.~
@598  = ~If you wish. Watch me very closely, <CHARNAME>. I put the flower on... So?~
@599  = ~Words rarely fail me. But so they do every time I look at you. You are beautiful, Sime, with or without the Suna’s Bloom.~
@600  = ~You look incredible: there is a glow about your face and your orbs shine; the troubles are wiped from your forehead and even your voice sounds sweeter to me.~
@601  = ~(*Shrug*) Yeah, some changes are evident. I guess the scrolls speak truly. We shall go now.~
@602  = ~Such gentle words, My Lord, are to be rewarded by a grateful maiden. (*She kisses you gently and runs away giggling*)~
@603  = ~Good to know that we can trust our scholars. (*Laughs*). Oh, I see you are growing impatient. I am coming!~
@604  = ~The scrolls say that a freshly picked flower of Suna’s Bloom will make one attractive to the opposite sex. We can see if it is true or not. Here, let me pick it and attach to your cloak. Then I can tell you the effect.~
@605  = ~You do not respect Love? Then you are a fool and a servant of Death.~
@606  = ~Do not try to remember: there is no name in Halfling speech for this one. It is a very rare plant. I am surprised you know of it. Do you know why it is called Suna’s Bloom?~
@607  = ~It is a very rare plant. And it is called Suna’s Bloom for a reason.~
@608  = ~You will not.~
@609  = ~I am lonely and sad tonight. Faerun feels enormous and cold. See how that little star twinkles and strives to shine, and barely can in this chilly air? So does my heart. It aches because of you. Will you keep me company and warm me up, <CHARNAME>?~
@610  = ~You are cold? Here, I’ll wrap my cloak around you, it is lined with fur and it is very warm. Sit down closer to the fire and I will get it going in no time. ~
@611  = ~I can offer you the comfort of my arms and warmth of my bedroll if you wish, Sime.~
@612  = ~Are you trying to say that you... love me? ~
@613  = ~I am afraid I cannot Sime. I am sorry, but I am involved with someone else.~
@614  = ~I am afraid I cannot Sime. I can offer no spark to set your heart aflame this cold evening... I am sorry...~
@615  = ~That is not exactly what I meant, but damn, it is pleasant to have someone to take care of me. You are such a wonderful person!  <CHARNAME>, I am attracted to you and it was not your cloak I hoped to have wrapped around my shoulders, but your arms.~
@616  = ~I can offer you the comfort of my arms and warmth of my bedroll if you wish.~
@617  = ~Are you trying to say that you... love me?~
@618  = ~I understood you perfectly, Sime. I hope you will understand me. I am involved with someone else.~
@619  = ~I understood you perfectly, Sime. I hope you will understand me... I am sorry... I can offer no spark to set your heart aflame this cold evening.~
@620  = ~Then move and let me lay by your side and shower you with kisses, my sweet lover.~
@621  = ~But of course I love you tonight! I fell asleep a moment ago and was dreaming of kissing you when I woke up. I like when my dreams come true in that regard. Is that not enough talk for you, <CHARNAME>? Won’t you hold me and kiss me already?~
@622  = ~Of course I will. A stone would melt from that devilish look in your eyes, let alone a lover’s heart. Come here, beautiful. ~
@623  = ~Tonight? What about on the morrow?~
@624  = ~ Actually I was going to discuss the origin of magic in Faerun, the nature of Weave and the descent of Dragons with you... Oh, what in Nine Hells I am talking about? Come here this very moment, enchantress, and let’s make the heavens shake.~
@625  = ~You know, it is very sweet of you to offer but I am just too tired. May be another time...~
@626  = ~Now, those are the words I wish to hear! Let me lay by your side and shower you with kisses, my sweet lover.~
@627  = ~Tomorrow will be another day, <CHARNAME>. We will die or we will live. May be we will love each other again, may be not. Why worry about it? We are together now, that is all that matters.~
@628  = ~You are right, dear Sime. But I would prefer that you still love me on the morrow.~
@629  = ~Why get involved with a thought that will be over in a day or two? I am disappointed that you treat me like this. I hoped that there was something special going on between us.~
@630  = ~Yes, I feel it as well, that we live, as each day is our last one. And I want to love a maiden on my last day that is for sure. ~
@631  = ~I cannot promise you a life-long commitment, a house full of books, flowers, and little ones with me as your wife, <CHARNAME>. But I can give you a night of passion, which you will remember till the evening dawn of your life. Take it or leave it.~
@632  = ~Of course I will take it. A stone would melt from that devilish look in your eyes, let alone a lover’s heart. Come here, beautiful.~
@633  = ~No, Sime, what you are offering is not enough.~
@634  = ~Then I shall return into my cold bed alone. Only in the tales of heroes-of-old does one get three chances, <CHARNAME>. With Sime it is only one and you missed it. Sleep tight.~
@635  = ~I cannot promise you a life-long commitment, a house full of books and flowers, <CHARNAME>. But I can give you a night of passion, which you will remember till the evening dawn of your life. Take it or leave it.~
@636  = ~Let me lay by your side and shower you with kisses, my sweet lover.~
@637  = ~Only in the tales of old does a hero get three chances, <CHARNAME>. With Sime it is only one and you missed it. Sleep tight.~
@638  = ~I wish you every happiness then. ~
@639  = ~Wake up, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>, the dawn is spreading over the sky! And the woman of the yester eve is up already and her eyes spell trouble for you. Wake up, m’<PRO_LADYLORD>, the world is holding its breath in anticipation of your decisions. Shall we live or shall we not? Shall we love or shan’t we? ~
@640  = ~No-yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever-or else swoon to death.~
@641  = ~You know, Sime, the last time a maiden awoke me yelling, it was Imoen and I was caged in Irenicus’ Dungeon, after being broken and tortured for months. Spare me bad memories and by all Gods of the Realms, do lower your voice!~
@642  = ~I would be up already were not you sitting upon my chest.~
@643  = ~Hmm, I take it you liked the pleasures we partook of last evening?~
@644  = ~The play between the sheets is play between the sheets, Sime. It was fine, but now we must get moving.~
@645  = ~Sime, my sweet Sime, if I were a god I would make this night last forever. But since I am only a measly demi-god I must put my feelings in words: it was awesome, wonderful, and unforgettable.  Kiss me another time to give me small consolation; for I must now take my hands off your body and let you hide it from me under your armor.~
@646  = ~Sime, my sweet Sime, if I were a goddess I would make this night last forever. But since I am only a measly demi-goddess I must put my feelings in words: it was awesome, wonderful, and unforgettable.  Kiss me another time to give me small consolation; for I must now take my hands off your body and let you hide it from me under your armor.~
@647  = ~Sime, I must tell you... It does not feel right. We shall not continue this.~
@648  = ~My point exactly, <CHARNAME>. Now, MOVE!~
@649  = ~I love you even if you are merely a demi-god. But do get up.~
@650  = ~Fair enough. Take my heart or loose it, <CHARNAME>, as you desire.~
@651  = ~I hope the analogy does not go any further than my loud voice? Or was last eve torturous for you? ~
@652  = ~Such a grouch you are in the morning! Pray tell, is it usual for you to grumble after a night of passion, or you are so exclusively with me? Do I love in a way that puts you in a bad spirit?~
@653  = ~I love you even if you are merely a demi-goddess. But do get up.~
@654  = ~<CHARNAME>, I want to make sure that we understand each other. You know what is my credo in love? Do not trust, do not fear, and do not ask.~ [SIME14_1]
@655  = ~Ahem, is it about the last night? I mean it was swell and all, but try not to make a big deal out of it.~
@656  = ~I never fear, be it in battle or in love. But I do not think I should take without asking and I wish to be able to trust.~
@657  = ~Why, Sime? Are you so afraid to get hurt?~
@658  = ~In the mad world we are living in, it is a sensible rule. I understand you, Sime.~
@659  = ~Well, I see that you have the attitude I desire, even if it was not put in the most gentle of words.~
@660  = ~Only madmen know no fear, <CHARNAME>. Bravery is in overcoming it, not in denying it.~
@661  = ~I am mad. Mad about you. And I am mad at you too, because you are trying to rob our relationship of any meaning.~
@662  = ~Then you shall learn to overcome your fear in the matters of love. Are you so much afraid of being hurt, that you would forbid yourself to trust a <PRO_MANWOMAN>, Sime Linvail?~
@663  = ~I do not want to argue with you, Sime. I would not want to hurt you. It will be as you wish.~
@664  = ~I am not robbing you, I am trying to protect you, <CHARNAME>.~
@665  = ~Love and trust are not the things I need to be protected from. I have too little of them in my life as is.~
@666  = ~You are not trying to protect me, Sime. You are trying to build walls around your own heart. Are you so much afraid of being hurt, that you forbid yourself to trust a <PRO_MANWOMAN>, Sime Linvail?~
@667  = ~I just do not want love to be an obligation! I do not want our love to turn against us or to become a necessity. Look at my parents: they loved each other against all odds and look what it brought them? My mother is dead and my father wasting himself on whores. I... I am getting very upset and I do not like it. I am sorry to have started this conversation.~
@668  = ~Yes, I am afraid. Look at my parents: they loved each other against all odds and look what it brought them? My mother is dead and my father wasting himself on whores. His love did not protect her from afar. Love me while I am close to you, not when I am away; love me while I am in a good health not when I am frail; and you will always be free, and should you go, I will remember you with a warm smile, not with a scowl. And I expect the same from you.~
@669  = ~You are a strange woman, Sime. I am not quite sure what do you want exactly or why do you want it, but be it as you wish. I do not care to argue with you, Sime. I would not want to hurt you. ~
@670  = ~For me, love always carries an element of devotion. I will not participate in this weird arrangement.~
@671  = ~I hope one day you will feel like I do. I hope you will understand we were meant to be together and that we are true soul mates. I hope you will trust me completely and you will love me without any fear or remorse and you will forget feeling you need to reserve a way out.~
@672  = ~You are ever so gentle, my love. Sometimes, it makes me wonder if I can play by my own rules with you.~
@673  = ~As I said - you are free to go at any time. Let it be now then.~
@674  = ~Sometimes I wonder, how could you endure all these trials, and keep your soul so young and gentle. You are truly a noble <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Just remember, it was not me who gave you that hope.~
@675  = ~I am glad. I hope that we both are sincere right now and we both know what we want. I... would not want to hurt you in any way, <CHARNAME>.~
@676  = ~We both do, do not we? No obligations, no questions asked, and we walk free should the time come. This is the only way to avoid hurting each other. ~
@677  = ~Sime, I do not know. The heart can change but why worry about it now, while everything is so good?~
@678  = ~I would not want to hurt you either, Sime. It will be as you wish.~
@679  = ~You are right. Let’s continue on our journey. Passion shall rule our nights, but not our day life.~
@680  = ~You know what I was doing last night? I was counting stars and giving them different names. I even considered calling one after you. Guess which one?~
@681  = ~Mystra’s star? Though, it’s my preference to think about you while watching it: it is so bright, beautiful, and mysterious.~
@682  = ~I think Mystra’s star is the obvious choice.~
@683  = ~Ieryn - the star of the North? I know it is sacred to Selunites and you have a deep spiritual connection with your mother. May be you were speaking of me to her while watching the night sky and Ieryn came to your mind?~
@684  = ~Shaundral? An erratic star who shines brightest before disaster? Like me, whose coming was foretold in Alaundo’s prophesies?~
@685  = ~King’s Coin? The star of the rulers for Men and the Kingslayer to Elves? Do you think I am destined for greatness or great failure?~
@686  = ~I do not know, Sime. Why do not you tell me?~
@687  = ~Mystra’s star? I love its blue soft light. May be if I had to select one star to name after you I would have chosen it. But you know, when I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@688  = ~Then I thought that everything which is fair and dear to my heart is somehow connected to you. You are in my frosted breath in the early morning, and in the tune I whistle when I wake. You are my sun and stars... I am afraid you are becoming my world.~
@689  = ~What about your own credo, Sime? The "do not fear" part? You have nothing to be afraid of by my side, me included. Neither you should be afraid of your love for me. I know one day I will harvest those simple words from your lips, undressed and unadorned. I yearn for that day.~
@690  = ~Too many fancy words, Sime. Do give me a more material declaration of your feelings for me. The night grows long and we do need some sleep afterwards.~
@691  = ~Now you have me wondering what star I shall name for you. I guess I will stay up all night poring over that task. I wonder why the poor and rich alike in these parts stock their bookshelves with endless copies of the "History of the North"? It must have been on sale or something. I’d rather fancy to see a "Star Lore" book somewhere...~
@692  = ~And I am yearning for a bedroll right now. Care to join me there? You have not embraced me for far too long, my lazy lover.~
@693  = ~(*Laughs*)... It can be as long or as short as you wish, <CHARNAME>. But I remember that on occasion you are prepared to forsake your sleep. So, what are you waiting for? Care to join me? You for have not embraced me for far too long, and I do not fancy lazy lovers.~
@694  = ~By Mielikki, I have created a monster! If you wish to begin your very own star lore book right now, I can help you I suppose. Alternatively, you may join me in my bedroll. I would like to bring to your attention that you have not embraced me for far too long and that I do not fancy lazy lovers.~
@695  = ~Why, because you are a wizard? I could have chosen it, I guess. But you know, when I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@696  = ~The most constant star of the sky? The one who guides my steps when I am lost? I could have chosen it, I guess. But you know, when I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@697  = ~Some might say that it is indeed a fitting star for you, <CHARNAME>. But I do not see its ominous light reflected in your eyes. You know, when I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@698  = ~You are dramatic as ever. Whatever your destiny, I hope you won’t know a great fall. I am too afraid of the darker fame of Kingslayer among the Elves to give it to you. However, when I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@699  = ~You are a wise one, <CHARNAME>, for it was a tricky question. When I was looking at the sky yesterday, I suddenly realized that every star reminds me of you.~
@700  = ~Future? Why do you suddenly want to know about the future? The only certain thing is that we all will die, sooner or later. Though yours might be a different story. You know, I pity seers, the ones who are burdened with knowing what is to come.~ [SIME17_1]
@701  = ~Sime, I was not talking about the future of Faerun! I was talking about you. What will you do when my quests are over?~
@702  = ~Future is one of your phobias as well?~
@703  = ~Why would you pity seers? Theirs is a rare gift and the great ones of the world seek their advice and wisdom.~
@704  = ~(*Laughs*)... So you foresee the end of your quests, <CHARNAME>? I do not believe you! Your job is never done, my hero. There will always be a city to save from foes or a maiden to rescue from the clutches of a dragon. And so long as you choose the honorable way, and we do not grow bored of each other’s company, I shall walk by your side.~
@705  = ~You are anything but boring, Sime. So fear not me leaving you.~
@706  = ~Oh, yeah. I love that sort of stuff. Dragons and foes, beware! <CHARNAME> and Sime are coming to get you!~
@707  = ~Do not you find that righteous path you are so eager to stay upon a little bit slow and boring? What if we deviate a bit for a while? Kill a couple of fluffy kittens and sweet old ladies? For variety’s sake?~
@708  = ~Do not you know a mortal’s
Short-living love?
A fateful excitement of blood, 
But as the days pass blood cools.
Who will resist parting,
temptation of a new beauty,
fatigue and boredom and
despotism of a new dream?~
@709  = ~Escape me?
Never-
Beloved!
While I am I, and you are you,
So long as the world contains us both,
Me the loving and you the loth,
While the one eludes, must the other pursue.~
@710  = ~If I say me, you will only laugh, right?~
@711  = ~Mere mortal - may be. But I am a demi-god, for all it’s worth. Mayhap I love differently, Sime.~
@712  = ~I went to the bird merchant
And I bought birds
For you, my love
I went to the flower shop
And I bought flowers 
For you, my love
I went to the smithy
And I bought chains
Heavy chains
For you my love
And then I went to the slave market
And I was looking for you,
But I could not find you there
My love.~
@713  = ~Do not bother to look for me at the slave market, <CHARNAME>. Nothing lasts forever and that is a good thing. It is all the sweeter that way.~
@714  = ~I will not laugh, but I will smile.~
@715  = ~Let me hope not. I want the love of a mortal person, the one of flesh and blood, not divine favor. It is the Forest Lady I pray to, not you.~
@716  = ~And none shall withstand our combined wrath. Speaking of which - it is past time we rejoin the others and press onward.~
@717  = ~If that will ever be your choice, I will leave your side, <CHARNAME>. If our paths should cross again afterwards, we shall join in battle as bitter foes.~
@718  = ~I am not afraid of anything that comes my way. I can handle it or I will die. But what I would not want is to know my future in advance. I’d be so bored!~
@719  = ~Boredom? That is what you are afraid of? Then you have found a great antidote: my life, and the lives of those who travel with me, is anything but boring. Stick with me and we are going to have loads of fun. There will always be a city to save from foes or a maiden to rescue from the clutches of a dragon.~
@720  = ~Why? Do not you want to be forewarned?~
@721  = ~I do believe you in that! Your job is never done, my hero. And so long as you choose the honorable way, and we do not grow bored of each other’s company, I shall walk by your side.~
@722  = ~You are anything but boring, yourself, Sime. So, fear not me leaving you as well.~
@723  = ~Dragons and foes, beware! <CHARNAME> and Sime are coming to get you!~
@724  = ~Forewarned? Guaranteed from making mistakes? No, <CHARNAME>, I do not want my days to be presented in front of me by some fortune teller. I love surprise and I love making decisions on my own. I thought you were the same sort of person.~
@725  = ~I was. Then I spent a year roaming the Sword Coast and being chased by every rogue in existence. In those days, I wish I had possessed some idea of what I am and what is my destiny.~
@726  = ~Oh, I have bloody forewarning, Sime. Made by Alaundo himself, not some cheap charlatan. Do not you remember: "the Lord of Murder shall perish..." and that entire circus?~
@727  = ~My destiny was foretold, Sime. And I feel that I know what is going to happen in the end.~
@728  = ~And how much more secure would you feel knowing that you are Lord of the Murder son and that it is your half-brother who is after you? Tell me is that your goal in life, to make Alaundo’s prophecy to come true?~
@729  = ~No, of course not. I live by the advice of my own heart. But the prophecy... the prophecy explains many things to me about the way I feel and I act. I would be worse off, if I did not know what I am.~
@730  = ~Yes. My destiny is clear and I shall take what I was promised.~
@731  = ~Sime, please, let us just drop this talk? Or I will damage my jaw yawning.~
@732  = ~And that is the only way to live! I am glad to hear you say that. But I think we should rejoin the others and press onward now.~
@733  = ~(*Quietly*) Was not that how Sarevok felt? ~
@734  = ~We cannot have that, can we? Let us rejoin the others and press onward then.~
@735  = ~I remember, <CHARNAME>. And I pity you for that. Tell me, is that your life’s goal, to make Alaundo’s prophecy to come true?~
@736  = ~Is there wisdom in being an oracle of events which have not yet happened? Is it really a great joy to be questioned constantly by fearful people and know that your answer may not be taken lightly by a Lord you serve? If I was a prophet I would hide from the rich and powerful, that is for sure.~
@737  = ~Everyone has a talent, a particular talent. And to fulfill your life it has to be realized. If a seer hid himself and ignored his visions it would drive him mad, I think.~
@738  = ~You would rather turn into one of the mad beggars walking the roads and foretelling doom to all?~
@739  = ~Going mad may be a wise choice for them. At least then they would not feel responsible for their counsel and not comprehend its consequences.~
@740  = ~Then any counselor or a ruler is better off mad, Sime.~
@741  = ~Sime, you stopped making any sense.~
@742  = ~You are being unreasonable. The prophecy of Alaundo explains many things to me about the way I feel and act. I would be worse off, if I did not know what I am.~
@743  = ~A mad Lord will cause great grief to his people. Because of that, I wish no ruler or his courtier to be mad.~
@744  = ~Let us rejoin the others and press onward then.~
@745  = ~I know that, <CHARNAME>. And I pity you for it. Tell me, is that your life’s goal, to make Alaundo’s prophecy to come true?~
@746  = ~No, of course not. I live by the advice of my own heart. But the prophecy. . .the prophecy explains many things to me about the way I feel and act. I would be worse off, if I did not know what I am.~
@747  = ~So, tell me of all those ladies you fancied in your past? Is there a maid still waiting for you in Candlekeep? Was there a companion of the road  who was dearer to your heart than any other?~
@748  = ~Sime, you are the only one for me. I can see the beauty and grace of other women, but I am somehow not attracted to them in the way I am to you. And I never was. I guess I was just waiting for you to come and claim my heart.~
@749  = ~Are you in the mood for absolving sins? Yes, I had a girl or two before. ~
@750  = ~There was a Northerner, tall and proud, who traveled with me for a time. A true warrior Branwen was, and beautiful beyond belief.~
@751  = ~I often had my eyes upon Skie Silvershield, a daughter of a Grand Duke of Baldur’s Gate.~
@752  = ~Dynaheir, her name was Dynaheir, but I rather not talk about it.~
@753  = ~There was a fighter I fancied for a time, Shar Teel by name.~
@754  = ~Is that true? Oh, no matter that sounds way too sweet for me to question it.~
@755  = ~And?~
@756  = ~No "and". I wish to keep some sins and some secrets, Sime.~
@757  = ~And then I met you. Sime, you are the only one for me now. I can see the beauty and grace of other women, but I am somehow not attracted to them in the way I am to you. No one else matters.~
@758  = ~I often had my eyes upon Skie Silvershield, a daughter of a Grand Duke in Baldur’s Gate.~
@759  = ~Dynaheir, her name was Dynaheir, but I would rather not talk about it.~
@760  = ~Oh well, I’ll let the bards figure it out for their songs.~
@761  = ~What ever became of her?~
@762  = ~My stone maiden she was. It is true, Sime. A lousy mage turned her into stone when she refused to fight unarmed people. I released her from the curse. I sort of thought that would promote a romance. But Branwen had been on her own quest to become a priest of Tempus. It was a position reserved solely for males in her parts, so when she judged that she had gained enough power, and the favor of Tempus was with her, she departed for her homeland to prove herself. I felt that I had to let her go.~
@763  = ~That was very noble of you.~
@764  = ~I guess. That was what I was kept telling myself for a time. But time heals all wounds.~
@765  = ~Noble? May be. That war hammer she was swinging in battle also played a role in my decision.~
@766  = ~I find that this sort of wound can only be healed by more radical means. The heart is like a port: as one ship is leaving another is entering. Fear not, <CHARNAME>, I foresee that you will love and be loved many more times.~
@767  = ~You are never serious, are you? I like that about you.~
@768  = ~She has gone off with her lover, a fortune seeker named Eldoth Kron. She is still trying to persuade Duke Silvershield to recognize their marriage. Until then, they are in hiding. I hope at least, Eldoth does not mistreat her.~
@769  = ~Young girls brought up in noble families can be so blind in the ways of the real world. Was there nothing you could do?~
@770  = ~Just like her father, I tried to make her to see Eldoth for what he was, but I got no better results than him. It only added to her conviction that the whole world was one big conspiracy against her love for the slimy bard.~
@771  = ~Well, all my courting went unnoticed. She considered me to be a lowlife.~
@772  = ~I tried but without success. As you said, she was completely oblivious to the way things work in the real world. But, Sime,that is enough of Skie. You are the only one for me now. I can see the beauty and grace of other women, but I am somehow not attracted to them in the way I am to you.  No one else matters.~
@773  = ~For her sake I hope she will wake up one day and meet someone more honorable. It always saddens me when hearts bleed for an unworthy person.~
@774  = ~(*Laughs*)...  Then she committed a grave mistake. I did never meet a lord more honorable and valiant than you. I would dearly like to have seen you in the beginning of your travels. A bit shabbier you may have been, but with less pain in your eyes, and more starlight and youth.~
@775  = ~For her sake I hope she will wake up one day and meet someone more honorable. But she will not have you now; I am a greedy woman.~
@776  = ~It is the name of one of your fallen companions, is not it?~
@777  = ~I know how it feels to lose a lover to death, <CHARNAME>.  That’s when our spinning and ringing world of battles and adventures comes to a crashing stop.~
@778  = ~If I only knew... Shar-Teel was a very angry person and trusted no man. Her life was not an easy one, I suspect. She let me have no more than a glance into her soul, which was far more than anyone else ever saw.  I suspect that she is fighting some battle somewhere or drinks and laughs with one group of rascals or another.~
@779  = ~It does not sound like a happy story, <CHARNAME>.~
@780  = ~Wrong people, wrong feelings. Happens all the time.~
@781  = ~You want a happy story? Then let us make it. You are the only one for me now. I can see the beauty and grace of other women, but I am somehow not attracted to them in the way I am to you. Nothing else matters.~
@782  = ~Yes, but I feel not comforted by that.~
@783  = ~A worthy idea! And we are hard at it already, do not you think?~
@784  = ~(*Reads to you from an old tome*)

"And His Grace the King came then upon Sir Knight and his Lady Wife. They were asleep on his cloak shielded by the branches of an ancient oak tree. Sir Knight’s great sword lay between them and so the King saw that his honor was not despoiled.  His Grace kneeled and slipped his own ring onto his Lady’s finger and then he rode off..."~
@785  = ~I am not sure I am truly convinced in the efficiency of that sword. Be there a blade between us or not, you will not be safe from my embrace. But I have heard of a ranger who used a direwolf for that purpose. That might be more efficient.~
@786  = ~Sounds like a thing Valygar would do. Or may be Kivan if some lady would imagine that she could replace his dear Deheriana. It would be a hamster, not direwolf in Minsc’s case, I guess.~
@787  = ~That sounds dangerous - a sword in the bedroll. Someone could get hurt.~
@788  = ~Ahem, Sime, do you think we can delay the story’s ending till tomorrow night? I am afraid my endurance is lacking compare to that of Sir Knight.~
@789  = ~That is a tale to warm up a noble heart.~
@790  = ~His name was Jon. But, do you imply that it is a typical behavioral pattern for rangers?~
@791  = ~In no way. Rangers can be very playful and outgoing. I even know one. Blonde tresses, green eyes, charming smile, and an absolutely irresistible way to kiss.~
@792  = ~Oh, no. I know that better than anyone else! Rangers are passionate lovers. Do not you agree?~
@793  = ~May be. But I can be convinced to reconsider.~
@794  = ~I have no opinion on the matter. You were talking about rangers and I remembered all I have met. No, wait I forgot Drizzt Do’Urden! Ahem, bad example, I am afraid.~
@795  = ~Now, that you started this talk about kissing, think we can delay the story’s ending till tomorrow night? And do some serious research on the ways the rangers love?~
@796  = ~Absolutely true, <CHARNAME>. Do you think we can delay the story’s  ending till tomorrow night? And do some serious research on the ways the rangers love?~
@797  = ~I am afraid it can take some significant amount of time. Do you think we can delay the story’s ending till tomorrow night? And do some serious research on the ways the rangers love?~
@798  = ~Bad example indeed. Have you ever heard about the courtesan in Waterdeep who approached him, thinking he was sufficiently drunk? Not only did he politely refuse her nineteen times, but on the twentieth he set his ale aside, pulled out his diary, and started reading her an excerpt on the Drow’s way of love... They say that poor girl refuses to enter that inn ever since.~
@799  = ~Sime, that... that cannot be true!~
@800  = ~Shall we keep talking about Drow or can we delay it till tomorrow night? I am afraid my endurance is lacking compared to that of Sir Knight or Drizzt.~
@801  = ~May be, but I have heard it from a very reliable source. Do you think we can delay this discussion? And do some serious research on the ways the other rangers love?~
@802  = ~Am I glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. I was wondering how long it would take you to figure out that I had not been kissed tonight yet.~
@803  = ~A direwolf sounds better to you?~
@804  = ~At least it is softer. And warmer.~
@805  = ~Where is your familiar?~
@806  = ~Depends. Did it work for that ranger?~
@807  = ~How about  warming up our bed ourselves?~
@808  = ~He’s off hunting. But at any rate, the werewolf did not work for Jon, why should it work for us?~
@809  = ~No, it did not. His lady was just as persistent as I am. I hope you will follow his suit and join me under the covers now.~
@810  = ~Am I glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>. I was wondering how long it would take you to figure out that I had not yet been kissed tonight.~
@811  = ~How about warming up our bed as well?~
@812  = ~I am not a mage, <CHARNAME>, and I am not even a mage’s apprentice, but there is a spell Darriel once taught me. I can see that you are weary and sad. The spell might put you into lighter mood. Do you want me to cast it?~
@813  = ~No, Sime, I do not want any spell cast on me. I will sleep now, and I will be fine once I have rested.~
@814  = ~What is the nature of that spell? ~
@815  = ~I doubt that a single spell can take away my worries (unless it kills Irenicus), but do cast it Sime. I’d welcome some entertainment.~
@816  = ~Sleep tight then, <CHARNAME>.~
@817  = ~That is a... surprise. You like surprises, do not you?~
@818  = ~No, Sime, not really. I do not want any spell cast on me. I will sleep now, and I will be fine once I have rested.~
@819  = ~It depends... But you said it is going to be something pleasant, did not you? All right then cast your spell and we shall see.~
@820  = ~I adore surprises, especially pleasant ones. Cast the spell, Sime Linvail!~
@821  = ~Give me your hand, <CHARNAME>...

Kaimeldor panta annonta ten’lle...~
@822  = ~I am glad to feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and see the light and the shadows play. I have not liked it at all in the caverns of the Underdark and its creepy inhabitants. How do you feel now that we have returned to the Surface? Are you a creature of light?~
@823  = ~I am a creature of light, Sime, no matter what they say about me. I have never been as jolly as when we came back under the gaze of the sun. I disliked the Underdark and all the foul creatures that populate it.~
@824  = ~Dark it is my fair Lady, but many riches are hidden within. I took a look around the mines that those gnomes worked. I say that the rock there might yield clear diamonds and glowing garnet gems. And that was naught but a small corner of the Underdark. Nays, Sime, do not judge the place unlikable too hastily.~
@825  = ~I agree with you in that I feel more comfortable on the Surface. But there is a certain beauty in the Underdark. And not all creatures that populate it are foul.~
@826  = ~I have to say that I felt fine in the Underdark. Drow are no worse than the snotty Elves in Suldanesselar. Solaufein fellow was quite decent. Deep gnomes are cute... Of course there were few unpleasant meetings, but that’s no different than on the Surface. Besides it is always warm there and it does not rain. In fact I am thinking of journeying there again when I will have time.~
@827  = ~I am glad we think alike.~
@828  = ~I did not think about it in that way, <CHARNAME>. But to tell you the truth, I treasure a flower above any jewel, and I like the light of sun above any riches.~
@829  = ~Oh, then I can give you wild flowers instead of jewels. How very wise and economic! The only thing that bothers me that I will be seen while picking up flowers, like some effeminate Elf.~
@830  = ~Ah, but what of weapons, Sime? Can you make a blade without shiny mithril or dark adamantite?~
@831  = ~You talk nonsense, girl. Flowers will wither, but gemstone would shine forever.~
@832  = ~I can propose an even more economic solution: give me your love, that’s all I need.~
@833  = ~Here you got me! Well, I guess I was not born to be a miner, but I shall be grateful that others were. Though if there were not any weapons ever made... there wouldn’t be fighting. Nay, I am silly. One can fight with wooden weapons, his bare hands or spells if he really wants to.~
@834  = ~Both flowers and gems are given by nature to us, and they both are beautiful. I am talking nonsense, <CHARNAME>. I guess the fresh air after the stuffiness of the Underdark made me feel queer.~
@835  = ~Indeed, <CHARNAME>. I am talking nonsense, I am afraid. I guess the fresh air after the stuffiness of the Underdark made me feel queer.~
@836  = ~I thought that I would never want to part with you, but I doubt that I would like to accompany you back to the Underdark. However... however there is a certain beauty in the Underdark. And not all creatures that populate it are foul. May be we shall go back. After all, I like a good adventure!~
@837  = ~Irenicus is nearer with every step, <CHARNAME>, we all know... How do you feel about it? Are you nervous?~
@838  = ~As I always do when I am about to bring justice to the world! Irenicus is going to be punished for his crimes and the righteousness shall triumph again!~
@839  = ~Nothing special really. One more foe to fight, big deal.~
@840  = ~I think I am... We have faced Irenicus before, and he is not exactly your commonplace diseased xvart. ~
@841  = ~It may sound odd, but do you think Irenicus is a black-hearted villain? That he cannot be redeemed? It is apparent that his capabilities are far above normal. Genius and evil are two things incompatible, a bard said once. Do not you think so?~
@842  = ~Sime, Irenicus had overstepped every moral boundary known.  Genius he might be, but a genius of evil. He destroys before creating. He is Evil incarnate, Sime, and an unredeemable Evil.~
@843  = ~I neither know, nor do I care, if he is apt for redemption, Sime. I have a personal score to settle with Irenicus, and I am bent on sending him to Nine Hells.~
@844  = ~There can be redemption for him, Sime, but it is not my part to bring it to him. ~
@845  = ~Do you think that he killed or destroyed more than you did?~
@846  = ~I killed those who were standing against me ready to fight. I neither tortured my enemies, nor violated someone by stealing his soul. May be I am not exactly what you would call an innocent victim, but you know my sister, Imoen. Do you think anyone, but a heartless monster could put her through the tortures she endured?~
@847  = ~If I did, then I am the stronger, and that gives me hope that I can defeat him. He has something of mine and I want it back! Irenicus can do whatever he wants in Abyss after I cast him down there.~
@848  = ~Sime, cannot you see the difference between Irenicus and me? It is scary.~
@849  = ~Irenicus’ crimes are immense, <CHARNAME>. I just hope that it will not be blind hatred and revenge that will guide your striking arm when we will finally meet him.~
@850  = ~Revenge is a noble passion. And hatred - I am past hatred I think. I see a man who has to be destroyed lest he renders the Realm into ashes.~
@851  = ~Sime, it is strange, but I do not feel hatred, nor I am going into this battle for vengeance. I feel that I am doomed to fight him. I think that he forged our link himself, by stealing my soul - only one of us is to live now. Forgive me if I am egotistical, but I want him to die, not me.~
@852  = ~The passions you are speaking about are dark ones, but they make my blood boil in battle. Therefore I allow them to fill what is left of my soul. But I know how to control them now, just like I can control the Slayer in myself.~
@853  = ~I am glad that you go into this battle leaving hatred behind, but I urge you to clear your mind of the thought of revenge as well. Have not you seen people obsessed with revenge and how empty their life becomes after the sworn enemy is dead? Please, promise me to reflect on that, <CHARNAME>.~
@854  = ~(*Smiles and touches your cheek*)... You know that your staying alive will make at least one more person happy, do not you? May be you are right, <CHARNAME>, maybe it is you or him. But be merciful if you should have a chance, will you?~
@855  = ~Then I admire your strength, <CHARNAME>. For you will be fighting two battles instead of one. But be merciful if you should have a chance, will you?~
@856  = ~It is, as I feared then. Blind hatred and revenge will guide your striking arm when we will finally meet him.~
@857  = ~Revenge is a noble passion. And hatred - I am past hatred I think. I see a man who has to be destroyed lest he renders the Realm into ashes. ~
@858  = ~The passions you are speaking about are dark ones, but they make my blood boil in battle. Therefore, I allow them to fill what is left of my soul. But I know how to control them now, just like I can control the Slayer in myself.~
@859  = ~Because.~
@860  = ~Imoen, Khalid and Dynaheir are my three reasons.  It is in my power to forgive him for what he had done to me, but how can I forgive him the torture and death of my friends? He did not give them any chances.~
@861  = ~I have judged him and found him guilty. The only mercy I have for him is the mercy of my sword hand. He will die quick and painless if that choice would be given to me, but he will die.~
@862  = ~I am not the redeeming type, Sime. He can go to priests of Ilmater for that, not to me.~
@863  = ~Oh, that was deep.~
@864  = ~Irenicus crimes are immense, <CHARNAME>, including the ones he committed against you and your friends. I can understand your anger and your pain. I just hope that it will not be blind hatred and revenge that will guide your striking arm when we will finally meet him.~
@865  = ~I am glad that you go into this battle leaving hatred behind, but I urge you to clear your mind of the thought of revenge as well. Have not you seen people obsessed with revenge and how empty their lives become after the sworn enemy is dead? Please, promise me to reflect on that, <CHARNAME>.~
@866  = ~(*Smiles and touches your cheek.*)... You know that your staying alive will make at least one more person happy, do not you? May be you are right, <CHARNAME>, maybe it is you or him. But be merciful if you will have a chance, will you?~
@867  = ~Care to take one along? Because it is most likely that we will meet with Irenicus before he will have a desire to visit Ilmater’s Temple.~
@868  = ~He will have the desire as soon as he sees me, I wager.~
@869  = ~You are a good enough priest, Sime. Besides, I am sure Irenicus would clutch to his sins, rather than have them absolved.~
@870  = ~A whole dozen if that will please my Lady! ~
@871  = ~Ahem, do you think they are any good in a fight those beggars?~
@872  = ~I doubt it not, <CHARNAME>. You scare even me sometimes. But be merciful if you should have a chance, will you?~
@873  = ~May be... after all, you know him better than I do. Let it be, then. But be merciful if you should have a chance, will you?~
@874  = ~<CHARNAME>, pleasing me is not the concern here... By Mielikki, you are grinning! Are you ever serious?~
@875  = ~You are thinking cannon fodder, are not you? You... you are a beast!~
@876  = ~It is apparent that his capabilities are far above normal, yes. He is a terrifying adversary. <CHARNAME>, I wanted to ask you something. It may sound odd, but do you think Irenicus is a black-hearted villain? That he cannot be redeemed? Genius and evil are two things incompatible, a bard said once. Do not you think so?~
@877  = ~There can be redemption for him, Sime, but it is not my part to bring it to him.~
@878  = ~Once I thought that I discovered a secret: love was once invented by an idle person, and the whole world believed it out of boredom or envy. My soul was silent since then and sickly.~
@879  = ~Why you are telling me that?~
@880  = ~But you do not believe it now?~
@881  = ~And what I am supposed to say?~
@882  = ~Because it was you who have destroyed my blissful ignorance, <CHARNAME>. Because you healed my heart.~
@883  = ~Oh... good.~
@884  = ~So now you are just like everyone else: waiting for a chanced meeting, afraid to part and singing sad songs?~
@885  = ~Of course it is good! But sometimes I am angry at you for that.~
@886  = ~You are cross with me because you love me? ~
@887  = ~I think I will just kiss you and hope for the best.~
@888  = ~It does not make sense, does it? Oh, Nine Hells, just kiss me, will you?~
@889  = ~Wonderful idea! That is guaranteed to cheer me up.~
@890  = ~You are supposed to say "uh-huh" and kiss me.~
@891  = ~Exactly. And it is your entire fault! I am cross with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@892  = ~You are cross with me because you love me?~
@893  = ~No, because you destroyed that belief of mine. I am cross with you.~
@894  = ~I have been studying you for so long, <CHARNAME>, that I can write a book about you. You are noble and valiant person. The sort that saves fair maidens from the clutches of evil dragons.~
@895  = ~Nay, Sime. There are enough fair maidens in the world and too few dragons. Though of course there is one maiden which is worth fighting a dragon for.~
@896  = ~Sure, I start every day by killing a dragon and saving a maiden. They have a terrifying habit of marrying me as a gesture of gratitude and now I have a harem full of princesses of all sorts, did not you notice?~
@897  = ~Sime, where is this conversation leading?~
@898  = ~You think so? (*Laughs*)... Care to try?~
@899  = ~Sime, you, rangers are supposed to prevent people from doing dangerous things, like fighting dragons for example...~
@900  = ~Sime, are you thinking what I think you are thinking?~
@901  = ~Sime, I do not want to fight any dragons!~
@902  = ~But, we rangers are also supposed to promote good deeds like maiden saving... And I really want to be a damsel in distress for once... Come, give me your hand!  Kaimeldor panta annonta ten’lle, <CHARNAME>.~
@903  = ~Oh, yes! Come, give me your hand! Kaimeldor panta annonta ten’lle, <CHARNAME>.~
@904  = ~What, not even a tiny one? For me? Please? I really want to be a damsel in distress for once...~
@905  = ~No, Sime, not even a baby-dragon. And you are terrible at making puppy eyes.~
@906  = ~Alright, alright, where is this beast I am required to slaughter to free my fair Lady?~
@907  = ~I will have to practice harder then.~
@908  = ~Oh, yes! Come, give me your hand!  Kaimeldor panta annonta ten’lle, <CHARNAME>.~
@909  = ~Is that true? (*Laughs*)... But I have not seen you do that today yet. We cannot leave you without a princess of the day, can we?~
@910  = ~I thought I might offer you a very exotic entertainment... very romantic too...~
@911  = ~I look at you and I see a man who died, went through Nine Hells, and is back. It chills me to the bones, Sarevok, to be around you.~ [SIMESA01]
@912  = ~I believe you, Dark Lord. Even if I did not, one look at those shiny yet empty orbs of yours would convince me.~
@913  = ~You are and you know that. But I cannot deny that you have certain attractiveness as well.~ [SIMESA02]
@914  = ~Strange compliments we have exchanged.~
@915  = ~Was it fear that led you to ask <CHARNAME> to bring you back half-way? Or is it redemption that you are seeking?~ [SIMESA03]
@916  = ~So why do you want to return to the world of living?~
@917  = ~If you enjoyed it so much, why did you want to become a god who does not have a need for neither women, nor gold, nor wine?~ [SIMESA04]
@918  = ~Wild is your blood and you are powerful. Yet you failed. May be you failed because you wanted power too strongly? How will <CHARNAME> fare, I wonder?~
@919  = ~And you are still here, you stubborn lout! Look, we are moving farther and farther away from Athkatla!~
@920  = ~Indeed. But the love my father and I share is stronger when there are long leagues between us.~
@921  = ~On the road I am because I hunger to behold new sights and new people. I am a wanderer. My eyes would start watering from watching the same place every day.~
@922  = ~Nay, I will not. I can see my dear friend’s faces every waking minute and still wish for more of their company.~
@923  = ~Indeed. But a married man is a dead man in Sime’s books, Keldorn.~
@924  = ~Oh, pardon me, my good Sir. [*Sinkers*]~
@925  = ~It is good of you my dear Lord Anomen to pick up my glove. I am much obliged.~
@926  = ~I am familiar with the concept, Anomen.~
@927  = ~I am an adept of another sort of love, Anomen.~
@928  = ~I am not the sort to gaze from afar at boys fighting. There are enemies and monsters abound. If my man is to fight a dragon I am to fight alongside with him. So I profess love of a kind when people share pain and walk together. While the love lasts.~
@929  = ~Indeed. And then it is time to walk your own way and keep fond memories.~
@930  = ~Do not listen to <PRO_HIMHER>. Sometimes <PRO_HESHE> is a bore!~
