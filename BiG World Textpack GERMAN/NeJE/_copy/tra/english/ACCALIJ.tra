@0    = ~I will say then goodbye my friends and wish you safe journey.~
@1    = ~Your choice to help the people of Kuldahar is a noble act Accalia, I will not try to sway your mind. It has been an honour to have had you amongst us and I thank you for the help that you have given. Farewell Accalia, and may your god watch over you.~
@2    = ~You are foolish to believe that you can take on evil such as this. You will surely die in your attempt, but if that is your wish then I leave you to your fate. Hopefully, Tempus will watch over you in this task that you have set yourself. Goodbye Accalia.~
@3    = ~As you wish Accalia. You show great courage in facing the evil here and I wish you luck in your endeavours to help these people. Farewell my friend.~
@4    = ~Farewell, Accalia, and may Tempus watch over you in this task that you have set yourself.~
@5    = ~As for you <CHARNAME>, to give your word and then to go back on it is not the action of an honourable person. Without your aid the enemy has won... well so be it but know that Hrothgar will not stand alone.~
@6    = ~Hello Imoen, and please, my name is Accalia.~
@7    = ~Washing my hose... what does it look like I am doing?~
@8    = ~If you must know Imoen, it is an account of all that transpires on this expedition of ours.~
@9    = ~Imoen, I do not find writing a journal boring, nor will I find it boring, when in the future, I look back and read about the friends I have made today. You are all in here... (*patting her book*)... for me to remember.~
@10   = ~No, you may not! A journal is a private and personal thing.~
@11   = ~Imoen, this is a journal, not some bard’s romantic tale! I write of our day to day struggles, of our battles with enemies we encounter on our road, and how we grow together in camaraderie.~
@12   = ~Imoen... stop... please. You can be assured that I have some very colourful words of my own when it comes to my writing about you. Now, please leave me in peace to finish today’s account.~
@13   = ~Imoen, you seen my journal anywhere?~
@14   = ~Strange, I don’t remember dropping it or leaving it anywhere. I’ll have to ask the others if they’ve seen it.~
@15   = ~Mmm, I may just do that. Before I do that, I thought you might like this clasp Imoen. See how beautifully it compliments your hair... don’t you think?~
@16   = ~(*Smiles knowingly*) Now where did that fall from? Some magpie passing overhead or was that a gust of wind I felt?~
@17   = ~Yes, I do believe it is mine. Thank you for finding it for me. I will have to try and not be so careless in the future and tighten my back pack better. Wouldn’t you agree Imoen?~
@18   = ~So am I. Before I go a little bit of advice for you Imoen, *eaves droppers never hear any good of themselves* and I should imagine it’s true of those who read other peoples journals, except *she never reads any good of herself.*~
@19   = ~Thank Tempus we are safe but it saddens me so few of us made it through.~
@20   = ~My faith in Tempus is such that he would not have put this path before me if it were not the right one to follow.~
@21   = ~I don’t see any other means of completing our mission.~
@22   = ~Why am I not surprised that the price for the success of this mission is the death of another?~
@23   = ~If this priestess is all that stands between the survival of Kuldahar, then her life is already forfeit.~
@24   = ~(*Smiling*) I think you were supposed to.~
@25   = ~I agree with you Dar, this is certainly a cunning foe that we are matched against, but my faith in both Tempus and in the wisdom of Arundel tells me that the battle will be won, we will be victorious.~
@26   = ~When we have all quite finished, I think it is obvious the gem is not here and we should not waste time debating the issue but do as Hrothgar says and make our back to Kuldahar without delay.~
@27   = ~As you say Hrothgar, we should leave for Kuldahar with all haste. I have some questions of my own to say to this druid friend of yours.~
@28   = ~If the evil that threatens Kuldahar is to be found here then I ask only that Tempus grants me enough life and breath to destroy it. His will be done.~
@29   = ~You have no need to ask where my duty lies Hrothgar, regardless of what everyone else here decides, you can rely on my support. Tempus has set me on the path to battle this evil and his will shall be done, whatever the cost to myself.~

@31   = ~Hrothgar is an honourable man. I do not believe him capable of evil, Tempus would not have me accompany him in this great battle if it were so.~
@32   = ~I am sure his reasons for his silence are well founded, please, think before you make any rash judgements. If he meant to do you harm, then you would not have been delivered here safely.~
@33   = ~As a battle priest of Tempus I can understand Kaylessa’s anguish over the fate that has befallen her soldiers. To be denied the honour of death in battle and be forced to live that final torment for ever is cruel and a fate no honourable being deserves. In Tempus’s name let us climb the tower and bring honour to those unfortunate souls.~
@34   = ~Of course Hrothgar. My fervour to do that which is right in the eyes of Tempus often gives rise to my use of hasty words, but never to hasty actions. I understand well the need for caution, even when we feel we know our enemy, we should never underestimate how the instinct to survive, can often turn a battle around just when we feel the foe is down.~
@35   = ~All this talk of returning home Hrothgar, is now not the time to remind <CHARNAME> of <PRO_HISHER> pledge to aid our cause?~
@36   = ~You speak as though you know that a choice is to be given... what did you learn from your inspection of the astrolabe?~
@37   = ~I cannot go any further with you <CHARNAME>, these people need my aid in ridding them of this evil, I cannot abandon them now. Once that is done I must find a way to return to Everard in Easthaven, as is the will of Tempus.~
@38   = ~Those he trusted and relied upon may desert him and run cowardly to the safety of their own time, but Accalia the battle priest of Tempus will stand beside him and Tempus will either guide us to victory or take our souls unto his keeping should we fall. Please, be gone and let Larrel send us on our way.~
@39   = ~I will hear no more! Because of your refusal to help, the blood of the innocent will surely stain your hands as though you had slaughtered them yourself. Whereas if it is Tempus’s will that I fall fighting for the innocent, my conscience and my god will grant me peace, will yours <CHARNAME>?~
@40   = ~I can not believe what I am hearing here! Not too long ago, we were both concerned that <CHARNAME> would abandon us to our fate and now you are proposing to do so yourself. What are you thinking Hrothgar, what of Kuldahar, what of Easthaven and its innocent people?~
@41   = ~ I thought you an honourable man and when you spoke of fighting side by side to the end in the defence against evil, I felt proud and privileged to die for such a cause. How could I have been so wrong about you?~
@42   = ~Yes... I believe I can... I am sorry if my words sounded harsh. Of course, I know you must have good reason to take this path. However, I can not travel with you Hrothgar, there is much for me to do here. Perhaps we will meet again when you return.~
@43   = ~Farewell my friend, may Tempus watch over you.~
@44   = ~What of you Dar?~
@45   = ~Nor shall I. As for you <CHARNAME>, to give your word and then to go back on it is not the action of an honourable person. Without your aid the enemy has won... well so be it but know that Hrothgar will not stand alone.~
@46   = ~Those he trusted and relied upon may desert him and run cowardly to the safety of their own time, but Accalia the battle priest of Tempus will stand beside him and Tempus will either guide us to victory or take our souls unto his keeping should we fall. Please, be gone and let us be on our way.~
@47   = ~Yes... I believe I can... I am sorry if my words sounded harsh. Of course, I know you must have good reason to take this path. However, I can not travel with you Hrothgar, there is much for me to do here. These people need my aid in ridding them of this evil, I cannot abandon them now. Once that is done I must find a way to return to Everard in Easthaven, as is the will of Tempus. Perhaps we will meet again when you return.~
@48   = ~Farewell my friends, may Tempus watch over you.~
@49   = ~Tempus protect us from the depravity of these creatures... using the innocent to feed themselves and as payment to some monstrous queen.~
@50   = ~Prudence is always good counsel when preparing to confront the enemy, but any delay would not be prudent... it will only serve to benefit our enemy.~
@51   = ~Let us pray to Tempus that our opponent does not change his ways.~
@52   = ~Certainly a demon, but what would such an ancient and powerful demon be doing in our world?~
@53   = ~It never did tell us what it planned on doing with the Heartstone Gem.~
@54   = ~If it was one measure of this little problem, then the “Ancient Enemy” must be just as old and just as powerful.~
@55   = ~Yea gods, what are we letting ourselves in for this time?~
@56   = ~By the will of Tempus, that foul creature has fallen and we have taken the Gem from her. Now what are we to do with it?~
@57   = ~Indeed, it seems this demon and its *Ancient Enemy* have always been engaged in this battle. From what I was able to follow the creature’s answers, I don’t like the prospects of either one of them emerging as the winner.~
@58   = ~Tempus is the only ally we’ll find in this place!~
