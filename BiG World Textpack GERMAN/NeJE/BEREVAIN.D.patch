After a bit too much to drink, Nesmot EXITed up in the clutches of a medusa and a maedar. The snake lovers got into an argument and upon seeing Nesmot's puny nose and the maedar's handsome one, the medusa wanted to punish her mate. The medusa quickly turned them both into stone, chopped their noses off and switched them out before returning them to flesh again. The maedar was weepingly furious but ol Nesmot was dancing as happy as could be. His new giant green nose was the talk of the town and all the gnomish ladies now swooned for him.~

Sometimes the children put on plays reliving famous battles.~

(Smiles) In fact, one year as a child I got to play as Tempus himself fully hidden and concealed behind a helmet and riding on two ponies representing his steeds, Veiros and Deiros. It was frightening to be wearing such heavy armor and having to stand with one foot on each of the two ponies, but was nonetheless thrilling and great fun.~
