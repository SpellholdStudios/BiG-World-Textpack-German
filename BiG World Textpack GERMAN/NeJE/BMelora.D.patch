-== BMELORA ~No, not magic but another subject close to my heart. I need your help with something... something, shall we say that needs your... our specialist touch. You up for it? ~
-== BIMOEN2 ~(*A glint comes to her eye as she anticipates that fun is to be had here*) Specialist touch you say... hmmm... how about you tell me just what this is that needs my specialist touch and then I’ll tell you whether I am up for it or not.~
-== BMELORA ~A small matter of righting a wrong, but I need your help to do it. So can I count you in?~
-== BIMOEN2 ~Stop beating about the bush Melora. I can see you are up to something, just spell it out and tell what you have in mind?~
-== BMELORA ~Well there’s this family, a widow and her children. She lost her husband during the time of troubles at the mine down near Nashkiel.~
-=
-~They moved to Athkatla in the hope that her parents would take them in but when they died, she was left destitute and took a job working for some fat lord in order to keep a roof over her children’s head.~ 
-=
-~The house is small, water leaking through the roof, doors and windows badly in need of repair, you know the sort of thing. As you can imagine, all this letting in of the weather is making the children ill all the time.~
-== BIMOEN2 ~What can we do? I'm a thief not a carpenter, so I can’t build a bigger house for them, or even begin to repair the one they’re living in now?~
-== BMELORA ~(*A little angry at Imoen’s flippancy*) That's not what I meant and well you know it!~ 
-=
-~The fat lord who rents them the house, says he’ll fix it up... some day, but if they keep whinging, he’s threatening to take away what little roof they do have over their heads now.~
-=
-~They have no money and you can’t raise a family on pieces of straw. So, I have a plan to help them to a better life that they deserve, but I can’t do it without another thief on board. You getting my meaning now?~
-== BIMOEN2 ~I reckon I am Melora, and I’m thinking you’re not just gonna go waltzing in and demand that this fat lord fix their house, right?~
-== BMELORA ~Right. This plan of mine has to be done under the cover of night. You see, I have information from a friend of mine, exactly where this lord stores his gold.~ 
-=
-~I figure we break in, take what we consider a fair share of the gold and give it to those who have a use other than storing it to count and gloat over.~
-== BIMOEN2 ~And what about guards? I’ve never known a fortune worth taking to be left unguarded for the likes of us to help ourselves to?~
-== BMELORA ~From what my informant says two, not too smart either.~
-== BIMOEN2 ~(*The glint in her eye brightens*) A most worthy quest Melora, and if by helping the helpless we help ourselves a little, then we’ll all be happy, excepting the fat lord that is.~
