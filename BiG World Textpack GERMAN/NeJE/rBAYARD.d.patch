She does not take much of this seriously, and when she realizes what she has been through it may be a rude awakening, to be sure. She is with my fellows, deeper than I wished to go. You may find them if you search, but I think the way they went has been blocked. There be so many passages it seems Durlag felt he could afford to collapse a few behind the unwary.~
