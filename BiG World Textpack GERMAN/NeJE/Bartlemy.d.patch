-I have solved the problem of Lavallin’s thief and in doing so I have discovered a partially constructed, and potentially powerful artifact known as a ring of might. Unfortunately the only clue I have as to how to go about restoring the ring, lie in the notes I took from the body of one of the mages instrumental in its construction... a necromancer who went by the name of Bartlemy. I can just make out the symbols of the four elements in his writings and the name Lhillias. Perhaps I should seek her out and see what she knows of Bartlemy and his ring. Lavallin was most generous in his gratitude and if I can restore the ring of might it will have been a most profitable quest indeed.~ EXTERN ~TUPUNG~ 7
