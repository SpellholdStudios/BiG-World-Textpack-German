-~What is life? Life is a miserable reflection of death. My life, in this world, seems so very distant... the memories clouded like those of a child. And a child I was, then... probing the darkest magic, given glimpses of the truths yet to come. Yes, look at me. And what do you see? A monster? An abomination?~
+@9
 =
-~(*Again he laughs*) I was an elven mage of great power, perhaps the most powerful elven mage who has ever been. For 200 years I studied the magic of Necromancy... the arts of physical and spiritual healing, the resurrection of the souls of the dead... Perhaps it is just the way of humans, but what I had seen and learned was not enough.~
+@10
 =
-~My studies were of the souls of the dead. Once I had seen the darker side of Necromancy, I began to speak with those souls, to animate the soulless, to quench the lives of the living. The bodies I experimented upon were already dead! If I raised their souls to again quench them, who is to say I didn’t have the right?~
+@11
 =
-~I craved knowledge, felt the shadow of my own mortality. And so I looked deeper, and the secrets of Black Necromancy were shown to me, and I reveled in the truths I had uncovered, and I shared them with my people.~
+@12
 =
-~They saw it differently than me, though... (*he laughs to himself*) They didn’t know what to think, and how could they? These were new discoveries, there were no precedents... and they listened to Her over the voice of their own reason, over my voice.~
+@13
 =
-~She had never loved me, She lied to me, She betrayed me, She waited for an opportunity to defame me, and when it came She viciously attacked.~
+@14
 =
-~I’m no monster... I know that the line between good and evil is a gray one, and perhaps all of my actions weren’t necessarily pure, but who are they to judge me? And banishment? Banishment for some questionable experiments?~
+@15
 =
-~They prepared to exile me, to throw me out of their number... but no! Her jealousy turned them against me, forced their hand. Her words became the evidence against me, and they sentenced me to the Void.~

-~That place has no time as you know it. I’ve been there for years uncounted, and yet I’ve not aged at all... I feel as I did the moment they sent me there, or as when the Dark Elves first called to me.~

-~My reasons for returning aren’t what you’d think. I have no aspirations for power or domination like you. I need you powerful living soul to come back and pay an old debt of mine. I need your power to plan my revenge.~
