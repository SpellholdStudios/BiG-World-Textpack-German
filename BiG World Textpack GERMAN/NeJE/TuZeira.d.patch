-At last... confirmation of that which I seek. I have spoken with a mage by the name of Zeira. She has confirmed that Halruaa is indeed about to make a move on Ulcaster in order to prevent the rising trend towards the generalist mage undermining the teachings of the specialist. It appears that specialist mages from across the realms have passed through Hulruaa on their way to Ulcaster to lend their support to this campaign. I must intensify the search for if I can not prevent this then the fate of Ulcaster and his academy is surely sealed.~ GOTO 1

The extra time required to specialise is time well spent as surely it is better to be adept in one school than master of none. The rising trend of the generalist mage threatens to undermine all that we strive to teach here. We cannot allow this to happen.~
